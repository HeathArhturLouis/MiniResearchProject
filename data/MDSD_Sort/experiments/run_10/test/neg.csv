 The early entries in the book (first 100 pages) are very interesting tales of unconventional lives revealing the author's confusion with his/her ethnicity.  However, after ten or so entries, the reading becomes old and repitive revealing many Americans need to preach their problems.  Being biracial/multicultural is not a problem but a gift which I can personally attest.  The readings need more creativity in establishing a point that is engaging but captivating.  Its too easy to simply say back when I was 4 I came to the realization that... and over and over again.  With this book all I can say is find the entry which most relates to your personal history because this book proves that the whole is not greater than the sum, of a portion mind you,of its parts 
 Recently there has been a surge of interest in "fantasy" type films.  With the huge success of "Lord of the Rings," I belive, people are exploring other movies, similar in nature.  Well, if you're an adult and you're getting reacquainted with the fantasy genre, this is one to MISS.  Ignore it.  Keep on walking.  Its really just for kids, at best.  The story is predictable and it repeats itself, hour past hour. The special effects are good enough for Saturnday morning t.v. but that's about it. I suggest you look at "Arabian Nights" instead 
 I had trouble concentrating while reading this book. Although I usually like to finish the books I start, I couldn't finish this one, and got While I was reading, I kept thinking, is there a point to all of this? It took me 400 pages before I realized that there wasn't really a point to al of Ackroyd's ramblings.  Ackroyd takes you on a tour of London in this mammoth book. The subtitle is "a biography," but it should read "a biography of London's poor in the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries." What bothered me the most was the fact that Ackroyd didn't do things chronologically. He'd talk about, for example, the coffee houses that proliferated in London in the eighteenth century, then go backward in time and talk about the Great Fire of 1666. He also gives the reader little bits and pieces of history--ie, the history of a particular area of London, or the history of the Cockney accent.   Absolutely no attention was paid to the bigger picture. Who were the major historical figures of London? What about the buildings themselves? In addition, Ackroyd pays scant attention to everything that happened before the Civil War. Sure, there's a chapter at the beginning, but its not much, considering the size and heft of this book.   I was disappointed in this book because I'd expected so much more. I'd really enjoyed his biographies on Dickens and Shakespeare and had thought that I'd like London: A Biography as well. Oh, well. You can't have everything. 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 maybe it's because he is such a stright shooter(pun ment) or something but clint doesn't do cold war thrillers very well(remember firefox). while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they don't cover up the fact that it was a good book that doesn't watch as good as it read.some may like it but i found it to be a let down 
 I was very disappointed in this video, Keb-Mo was good, but there was very little of him playing, actually there was very little playing by anyone. The interviews were fine, but you find yourself waiting for the music to start, and when it did, it didn't last.It is alright, not great by any  means, I would be hard pressed to buy it for more than a couple dollars 
 Yes it is true that you need special learning to understand Pound.  I did my undergraduate thesis in Pound and I am still confused.  I am now a student in Biology. Pound said (somewhere) that biologists are the best scientists because they observe the world. He thought scientists were stupid otherwise.  Since Pound I have discovered Dawkins, Ridley, William James, E. O. Wilson just to name a few authors.  They make sense to me.  Get the Cantos only if you are really dedicated to understanding one man's view of history and culture. He really believed that culture particularly past cultures affected people.  In this sense he was a behavioralist.  A little science would have helped him. This book is a throw back to the age of the oral narative when gods came down and took possession of a person. Somewhere in the Cantos he says : "The Africans have more sense than the Greeks"  who says?  Where is the proof.  He thinks he has found some. Also he writes: "We should keep our promises to the Arabs" maybe that is true.  I wonder, as a follower of Musolini would he be a follower of Osama today just to get into hot water and be controversial.  Like Homer he was blind as a bat! "A serious Character"  a biography of Pound is a good read.  
 This collection of essays was obviously thrown together as publicity for the authors' next books.  If you read the author bios in the back, almost all mention a new book coming out shortly and several even include website addresses as an additional plug.  I was less than impressed with all the authors and definitely won't be buying any of their material.  Their essays in "The Worse Noel" are all dreary, pointless, and stupid.  I was expecting some witty, dark humor but nothing even comes close to the mark.  This book wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, and it wasn't even particularly clever.  It's just another contrived marketing vehicle for a bunch of writers doing a "depressed and cynical" schtick.  Don't waste your money 
 Absolutely ridiculous tale.  Sappy to the extreme - - big yawn 
 Mouse movement is extremely slow. It literally takes 10 (!) seconds to get from one side of the screen to another (800x600). I just got it from OfficeDepot [...].  Buttons are too small and hard to control. Joystick is unresponsive 
 This has been a bit disappointing in regard to the signal quality I get for my Home Theater PC.  I got nearly the same signal strength from the free antenna that came with my tuner card.  
 I bought this book 2 months ago and I am still kicking myself for spending the money. I found this book to be condescending, preachy and at times, down right irratating. I was looking for practical, sensible tips on how to live my life in a more frugal and environmentally friendly manner.  All I got from this book was pie-in-the-sky, warm and fuzzy, painfully trite prose.  It became increasingly obvious as I forced myself to plow through this book, page by sappy page, that McBride spent far too much time researching quotes as headers for her chapters.  Had she spent anywhere near as much time writing about tried and true, honest to goodness money saving tips and techniques,  this book would not be such a waste.  To anyone considering this purchase, check it out of the library first to see if you like it, I sure wish I had 
 Haven't read the book, so can't compare, but  The Relic on film is simply pathetic. Yes, it's a monster movie. The problem is, this movie is no better than most of its genre, and worse than some. The monster looks like a refugee from one of the Star Wars episodes. The acting and dialogue are terrible. What a yawner! 
 I rented this DVD because I thought it was a light romantic comedy and because I wanted to see Gretchen Mol.  Well, one out of two ain't bad. One problem with this movie is that, despite claims to the contrary, it still comes off like a play, which is what it was originally. Unfortunately, the playwright-director, Neil LaBute, couldn't quite get this to work on the screen. The scenes lack life and perspective. There's also an absence of continuity, which might have been remedied with the use of, say, a musical score or better segues between acts. Instead, there are too many pregnant silences that presumambly would have been filled with the responses from a live audience,  but, since it's not a live play in a theater,   remain- embarrassingly silent. In truth, the character of the production smacks of something David Mamet might do, but it lacks that level of quality- which leads to my other objection: beginning lightly it turns dark and then darker, but not with subtle nuance. Granted, there is a basis to make us curious, and the dialogue contains occasional witty lines. Nonetheless, we're being misled as we also get mauled.  We discover, too late, that we've been given a moral lesson.  It's not that the message itself is disturbing- it's the bombast with which it is ultimately delivered. Even less tolerable is the imbalance along the way- the tedious, laborious journey accompanied by too many annoying instances of rudeness (crudeness). Buried amidst the rubble is a good performance by Rudd, and another by an ill-utilized Gretchen Mol (reminder: I chose this to see more of her). Weisz is also worth mentioning, but she's a bit too (read: VERY)intense. Would her character have behaved this way in real life? Perhaps- but the stark brashness does not seem necessary to make the point. I guess this could be considered interesting, but it's not worth the (uncomfortable) time you'll spend waiting for the ending. Besides- I expected something light, remember 
 i was really hoping this would be a great book, but i was severely disappointed. this was the only book i bought for Venice, and i wish i had saved my money. i ended up getting a DK eyewitness book and it was way better. the information didn't seem to be up to date, and we found better suggestions from our hotel 
 I think the music is ok but boring. The musicianship IS decent, but the production sounds very humble and home done on a computer with cheap software. It's interesting to hear the covers one time. I value my listening time and guard it jealously. Who would waste an hour on this when you can be listening to the great Spanish Guitar Masters?  For guitar music that truly captures the heart I'd rather listen to the greats of Flamenco like Paco de Lucia or Manolo San Lucar's Tauromagia for example. This cd pales so horribly IN COMPARISON to the music of the Spanish Masters.  But of course if Rolling Stone says it's good than it must be 
 I have been studying astrology for twenty years and practicing it for a few.  I bought this book based on the glowing recommendations here on Amazon.  I wish I had not.  The premise of the book is sound.  It is that, unless something is promised in the natal chart, then it will not manifest in the life of a client.  But the author almost immediately contradicts herself.  On page 42 she says: "We are not stuck with the natal promise of our chart.  There is always the potential to outgrow the more difficult aspects."  WHAT?  Does the natal promise matter or does it not?  Please make up your mind!  From there it just gets worse and worse.  The chapter called "The Natal Promise" is laughable and exemplary of the rest of this book.  The author reduces everything to childish, ridiculous generalizations.  For example, the entire section on "Success" is about the Nodes.  Apparently, at least if you follow her advice, you have no chance of success unless your North Node is in an angular house (1, 4, 7 or 10).  In the section "Violence/Rape," all she discusses are hard aspects between the Moon and Pluto.  Try telling my friend who was savagely raped and beaten that she must have imagined it happening to her since she has no aspect in her chart between the Moon and Pluto.    Not only is this book shoddily written and edited, as another reviewer mentioned, but there are some GLARING errors.  In the section on "Vocation," page 68, she claims that "Jackie Kennedy had her tenth-house Neptune in Scorpio, and she was a book editor."  Well, Neptune did not even enter Scorpio until 1956 so unless Jackie O. was about seven years old when JFK was shot, then this is completely impossible.  Finally, a large bulk of this book, maybe a third of it, is devoted to childish, cookbook interpretations which are vastly oversimplified.  But my biggest complaint comes with the author's system of making predictions itself.  It ultimately relies on eclipses, progressed house cusps and the position of the progressed Moon in order to pinpoint dates and times of events.  This, in my experience as an astrologer, simply doesn't work.  And as someone else noted, she makes no mention of Solar Arc Directions whatsoever.  The author's rambling narrative and anecdotes occasionally bring up an interesting observation here and there.  But based on all of her other glaring errors and omissions, it makes one wonder if her observations are even worth considering.  Ironically, she even promotes in the introduction to the book that astrologers develop a "personal method" in making predictions (in other words, she is suggesting that you may not want to use her method).  Honestly, I'm amazed that her method has worked for her, but if you are expecting it to work for you, then you are likely in for a big surprise.     This book was a huge waste of my time and I wish that I had not purchased it 
 I've just finished reading Boykin's book, "Beyond the Down Low."  While I find it well written and his observations often on point, I come away from reading the final paragraph thinking, "So what?"  Really, Boykin has unearthed nothing "new" about sexuality or sexual identity as it has been played out since there have been men, women and the undecided.  Boykin's book gains much of its cachet because it is one of the few published books that addresses sexuality from the perspective of a gay black man.  The very paucity of literature that focuses on the plight of gay black men in America alone makes Boykin's contribution invaluable, regardless of the quality of his prose.  Ultimately, however, his work is forgettable 
 Dem Franchize Boyz drifted around the ATL music scene and dropped a number of independent releases, but then their song "White Tee", while not necessarily becoming a major hit by Billboard standards, did give them some brief attention. But that's nothing compared to the popularity they've received thanks to their latest album, On Top of Our Game.  I personally don't see what the big deal is about this album. Before I listened to it, I thought I would be annoyed by all the snap music, but it turns out that the problem isn't necessarily the music itself, but the below-average lyrics that all four members of Dem Franchize Boyz put on wax. I never was that impressed by "I Think They Like Me" (an obvious single because it's censored), but the thing is, that's actually the best song on the album.  Many of the songs feature all-too-familiar subject matter, like cars ("Ridin' Rims"), bling-blingin' ("You Know What It Is"), and hardcore sex ("Freaky As She Wanna Be" -- and why does Trey Songz keep wasting his talent like this?). The choruses can get a little uncreative too: "Don't Play With Me" has "B, don't play with me" while "Stop Callin' Me" has "B, stop callin' me" (by the way, calling the latter song wack would be an understatement). And "They Don't Like That" makes me wonder if they were reading our minds.  The production also tends to get repetitive; when I heard "Suckas Come and Try Me", I felt like singing: "I think I think they like me!" And the remix of "White Tee" is unnecessary, especially because they mention their white tees in just about every song on here. I'm also starting to think my brother was right when he suggested that D4L and Dem Franchize Boyz are the same group.  The only thing more annoying than the group's rapping is when Damon Dash shows up on "Bricks 4 the High". No, he isn't rapping; he's instead talking -- no, not talking; WHINING about severed ties with Jay-Z and Roc-a-Fella (*sigh*...is he still talking about that?). In the end, while I wouldn't call this the worst So So Def album ever (Young, Fly & Flashy Vol. 1 gets that honor), it's pretty darn close. If this is Dem Franchize Boyz at the top of their game, what does rock bottom look like?  Anthony Ruper 
 24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.   My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.   Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into. 
 Like the title states, the tape was of poor quality and skipped alot, making viewing difficult, and it is to much of a pain and just as costly to ship back.I do not recommend buying from this media distributer 
 The bar is nice, and I suppose the mat will come in handy for reviewing the basic positions. But the DVD... it's just awful. The music is painfully bad. Seriously, what dp little girls dressed like fruit have to do with ballet? And the "host" is a confusing choice: her accent is distracting, and it's made even worse by the fact that she's talking around braces. The two little girls who help her don't look much happier. In fact, the one on the left looks like someone told her to smile or else.   Trying to keep up with the nominally enducational DVD is harder than you might think, as the mat has two sides and you have to flip it over mid-stream, only you get no warning and no time to do it. And the positions are introduced too quickly and with no discussion; they're just lyrics to the annoying song.  Our daughter got this for her 3rd birthday, and she actually looked at me the first time we watched it and said, "I want the fruit to go away." I had to laugh out loud and tell her I did too! Overall, I'm sorry her grandparents spent $15 on this. Total disappointment 
 This is a great story for the holiday season and is a great anomaly in what was a horrible war of attrition.  However, the book is more of a collection of thoughts rather than an oral history or an actual story.  At times I couldn't tell which side I was reading about unless the names were totally obvious.  Also it may be tougher to understand if you don't know the geography or the history of the WWI era and how it came to pass.  
 Too many errors in the book, it can cause more frustration and confusion than it is worth 
 I purchased this cable thinking because it was a sony product that it would be as the TV's, how wrong I was.  After 4 weeks of using the cable, it died.  I then purchased a monster cable and it has worked perfectly!!  (Its worth extra money!! 
 This book promotes stereotypes by radically overstating some slight differences between the sexes. If you want a scientific explanation of how they are grossly misrepresenting science, read either:  1) Brain Gender   by Melissa Hines (2004)  or 2) The esssential difference: the truth about the male and female brain   by Simon Baron-Cohen (2003) 
 I bought this book thinking it would help me understand this form of a relationship in words so that I could relay the feelings I have to others.  It is really hard explaining this way of life without sounding like pervert or pig.  I know there are always people that will just not get it but I have people that are truely interested in what I am talking about and yet I don't know how to talk about it.  I also was in a semi poly relationship at the time of purchase where one of my partners got freaked out when she relised what she was doing.  I thought this book would help me brush aside the years of programming that people have about a 'proper' relationship and help clear some light on why this is positive why you aren't a deviant if you choose poly and generally feel positive about it.  I didn't find much help and with thinking I may have been blinded I gave it to both of my partners and they had similar opinions.   I was just surprised by how much this was recommended and was dissapointed by it in the en 
 This book was clearly for beginners only.  Although the book says "for dummies", you'd really HAVE to be a dummy to get much out of this.  The book is simply too vague when talking about important internet concepts and doen't show you how to REALLY get an online business going.  I personally would reccomend 33 Days to Profits by Yank Silver  www.33daystoprofits.com as a much better way to get PRACTICAL advice on starting an online business 
 Or maybe use it as a paperweight; gosh knows it's heavy enough.  Let's see...if you can't figure out who the bad guy is by about page 50, you're either asleep or you just ain't tryin'.  Hackneyed characters, implausible situations, convoluted plotting for its own sake...but hey, a couple interesting tidbits about Hess's aborted mission to England (or was ALL THAT made up, too?).  The big plus for this book is that you can easily read it on an airplane flight.  Any airplane flight.  Like Chicago to Tokyo.  Or maybe Chicago to Peoria.  Just depends on how many pages you skip while reading.  As I got "into" the story, I started skipping 3, then 5, then 8-10 pages at a time.  Sometimes whole chapters.  Never lost the "plot" (what?), never missed the "sex scenes" (huh?), might have missed some ridiculous blood and guts (plenty more ahead on page "X+5" - not to worry).  Can't wait to skim his other books 
 Hindsight is always 20/20. People critical of the New Deal have no idea of the fear and hopelessness that the average American was facing in the 1930s. The New Deal/Roosevelt were not without flaws, but look at our modern response to  war and natural disasters. Seventy years later people are still affected by the depression. This author of this book needs to loose his life savings and go hungry before being critical of  the New Dealers. 
 Contrary to one review, Novas and Cao did NOT research.  There are so many instances of incorrect information as well as shameless stereotyping.  I strongly feel that no one should waste their time or money on this bound  book of filth 
 While the story was very entertaining and the high expected quality from Gemmell it was quite disappointing because of the references to Troy with Trojan and Mycenean heroes.   Gemmell has obviously done his research of the Trojan war because even minor heroes such as Glaucus, Ajax and Anchises are mentioned. However, almost none of the characters are who they are in the Trojan Saga and is very disappointing to see how Gemmell disgraces characters in the book when they were heroes in the Trojan war (ie. Glaucus became very close with Diomedes and both lived to adulthood & became heroes. Glaucus also traded his bronze armor for Diomedes' gold armor during the war, which has not yet occurred).  Also major characters like Agamemnon & Anchises are killed at the wrong time and by the wrong people, much like Glaucus and Diomedes who are already dead but should have lived to the Trojan war. The personalities and actions developed by the characters also do not match their true character in the Iliad. I dont understand why he cannot just use different names if he wants the story to take place in the same era instead of using hero names, changing their entire lives and contradicting the Iliad. 
 I personally have not taken this diet pill; however I am compelled to note the descriptions from folks stating that they felt "trippy" "weird" and "out of sorts". Britney Spears had been taking this stuff for a while...then as we all know she went all "postal", shaved her head, attacked photographers and just all around went out in left field and didn't return.....and we wonder why she did it...hummmm... None the less, the side effects like those reported I've seen personally from close friends. They should re-name this diet pill Asylum-X, because that's where you'll be. Diet pills like these have a negative effect on the seratonin in your spinal fluids, and I don't know about you but I'm not comfortable with something altering my state of being....just something for you to "swallow" 
 I would agree with what the other reviewers said.  The writing jumped around too much between charachters, the characters weren't particularily likable (unlike the first book), and the action became tedious. I literally forced myself to finish it.  Luckily I bought the book cheap secondhand.  
 It's hard to know what to say. There wasn't enough juice to this book that it kept my interest. The writing style is dull and pedantic, the examples are trivial, the illustrations useless. There is something fundamentally wrong with this entire genre of *thinking skills* books. The authors usually show little ability to relate complex, real world problem solving to higher models or theories. It appears that there are two classes of writer: those with much practical experience and good war stories who rely on instinct and intuition, and those who read like they have been up in their ivory towers and do nothing but trade academic papers back and forth. For some reason the two never meet so we are forced to choose between guys who don't know how to translate the thought processes behind their actions into words OR guys who have no idea of how they could bridge their concepts into profitable, concrete action. This book, regrettably, falls squarely into the second category of think-a-mush. Completely uninspiring. Typical of books that are forced on unfortunate college students. Save your money for something better, whatever that might be 
 Those who buy this DVD should be aware that the documentary takes one part only. Armenians lived with the Ottoman for more than 500 years without any problems. The problems started with the rebelian Armenians and the trader Armenians. The government forced the Armenians to leave their places. There is no way you can have more than 1 million people in the eastern city of Van in Turkey. This kind of movies are strongly supported by the Armenian lobbies 
 It is unfortunate and disappointing that this book is being promoted as an "objective history" of the Mormon Church.   Abanes goes to great lengths to criticize Mormon historians who are so clearly "biased" and agenda-driven. Abanes should take a long look in the mirror.  "One Nation Under Gods" clearly has an agenda, and that agenda is miles away from historical objectivity or truth. I'm quick to acknowledge that many official church publications are also guilty of skewing the picture in their favor. I prefer neither Abanes's Anne Coulter-ish diatribe or the Church's sometimes image conscious, faith-promoting-at-the-exclusion-of-truth method.  If you want a real historian, and truly objective Mormon history read Richard Bushman's "Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling." In fact, if you read that right after Abanes's sham, the difference will be quickly apparent. Bushman leaves out nothing; he hides none of the controversies or difficult subjects. But he is fair and provides context and a variety of perspectives.  If you're keen on anti-Mormon rhetoric, by all means, buy this book---it will surely fuel the fire. But if you're looking for real history and a real understanding of Mormonism, you would be best to look elsewhere. 
 This is the only book in my collection that I did not bother to finish. I have been reading on the subject since my early youth but this book could not retain my attention. It seemed repetitious at times and simply put...boring. I will end up using it as filler material for the bottom of my book shelf 
 I am completely disgusted that she has the nerve to even think that! Sharon Rocha is Laci's voice. This book is just another in the long line of books in the Peterson cash cow extravaganza. "For Laci" is a much better choice if you want to read about the Peterson case 
 I was not familiar with D.C. Larue before purchasing this CD. I had heard only his awesome song entitled, "Overture" - truly a disco great - but there's nothing on this that comes close to it's excitement and fun (the closest second is "So much for L.A." The rest of the songs seems to be tediously similar to each other.  Disappointing 
 I know, I know, he sold out years ago, but I was really surprised that people were reviewing this release. People, the GREAT Rod Stewart (and he was GREAT) left the building years ago, this is another sad cash-grab. Buy some Faces, please,  and listen to how fantastic they were, better than even the Stones. After that, Every Picture Tells a Story, Never a Dull Moment; what can you say, the beginning of the end, sure, but magnifigant all the same.  Rod Stewart is not the clown he appears to be on his latest recordings; he's an incredible singer, interpreter and thoughtful talent who, I want to believe, has yet another GREAT album in him.  Buy and listen to some Faces non-believers, or Jeff Beck Group; you'll understand why Rod deserves his Rep 
 We paid for a 12 month subscription and I got the magazine for about 4 months. I couldn't get anyone to answer why it stopped and basically they just took my money. I didn't get a 12 month subscription. I got ripped off.  Plus when I did get the issues they are very poor paper quality and the covers and some of the pages were always ripped and bent up. Very disapointing... 
 Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did 
 An old story with a new title. What a rip-off! Too bad I can't rate it ZERO STARS 
 but it sounds like running bath water.  I too have had exposure to real woods, real rivers - this is not it 
 This is my second attempt (via replacement order from amazon.com) to play back the "extras" on disk-3/side-2. Unfortunately, there was nothing but green lines streaking across and shreading the video (just like in the first set I received). What I found strange, was the fact that the Universal logo played back perfectly...hmmm!  This is, obviously, a bad batch coming from Universal. Sadly, I will, once again, have to return this set to Amazon. This time I'm going to ask for a refund.  For all you "techies" out there who think the problem is mine, please note the following: The disk was played back on a brand new PANASONIC DMR-ES25S DVD player/recorder, and SONY "Pro-line" DVD player. It was also tried on a MAC G-5. Nothing worked, and the same results were realized.  Until Universal gets their quality control act together, I'm going to have to pass on this one. Hopefully, Amazon.com will put out a notice about this problem (like they did with the second Beatles box set & its first release with incorrect mixes).  As for the rest of the set, it's great. However, why buy a box set if you can't enjoy ALL the extras? Sorry folks...but this gets only ONE star!  Buyer beware!!! It's not Amazon's fault - it's UNIVERSAL'S!! 
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
 Horrible!  Shame on the Man Booker Prize for awarding any accolades to a book that should have never been published 
 Loses grip on can and the can slips off ...bad product. Do not buy 
 I wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as I can to help keep the shot stable (I shoot birds at 700mm). The first thing my friend and I did was to compare two identical lenses/cameras etc. - one with, one without, the extender.  Result: - the image appeared the same size, and the extender slightly blurred the image. In other words - completely useless 
 I'm no expert on Herman's bands, but I have several other collections and this is far and away the whimpiest. Well over half the songs are sentimental ballads or comic novelty numbers. If you like those kinds of songs, this is your collection. But if you're looking for the up-tempo, full-tilt, straight ahead swing that (I thought) Herman was best known for, this is a big disappointment. 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 I was reading about my son.  It all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense.  Really talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. Then half way the book screeched in a new direction.  All of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view.  When it comes to sex the authors don't want you to leave the decision with the teens, they want to take that one back, which weakens the premise they present.  The authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position - which I would have respected, if not agreed with.  Then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes Christ into the conversation/solution.  If I knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system, I wouldn't have spent the $22.  I would have wanted to know that in advance.  Tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book.  Buyer Bewar 
 I thought the dialogue was awkward and overly dramatic, and the whole storyline was unrealistic.  Many times, the author repeated herself, as if she forgot that a particular point had already been made just a few pages before.  There wasn't enough character development, either 
 This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.  PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.  
 WHY MUST YOU ASK? WELL, AFTER SEEING THE LAST EPISODES, THIS SEEMED WIMPY. I MEAN, GOHAN BEAT THIS GUY WHEN HE WAS 5 YEARS OLD AND WAS STRONGER THAN GOKU, IN THE FIRST MOVIE. AND AFTER FACING FRIEZA THIS GUY SHOULD BE A ... ANT IN COMPARISON. IM SO SURE 3 OF THE WORLDS GREATEST FIGHTERS THAT  FOUGHT SO MANY BATTLES AN CAME OUT ALIVE AND STRONGER EACH TIME. GARLIC  OUGHT TO BE A BIG PUSH OVER TO THESE GUYS. BUT ITS AS IF THE Z FIGHTERS  HAVE WIMPED OUT. SORRY TO BE SAYING THIS TO ANY DBZ FAN BUT DONT BUY THIS  ONE. IM A BIG DBZ FAN MYSELF AND HAVE ALL EPISODES UP TO GARLIC. AND I  WOULD HAVE TO SAY ITS THE WORST IVE SEEN YET. JUST HARD TO COMPARE TO THE  FRIEZA SAGA WITCH TOTALLY ROCKS. GOOD TO WATCH ONE TIME MAYBE, BUT DONT  INVEST IN A COPY YOU WONT WATCH IT AGAIN BELEIVE ME. AT LEAST THE TRUCKS  SAGA HAS STARTED, NOW DO INVEST IN IT. WELL WORTH THE MONEY. THANK YOU! DBZ  FAN 
  The Wizard of Oz said to Dorothy, "You had the power to go home all the time. You just had to realize it." That is the message of this book and others like it. Of course the realizing can be a journey and take some time and effort. But most importantly it has to be directly experienced, not just intellectually understood or faithfully believed.  I do not doubt the veracity of the people who have had their lives changed by reading this book and following its tenets. However, I must say that the most well intentioned self-help books often fail to achieve for their readers the desired effect. Not only do they fail but the rebound effect of that failure leaves the vulnerable reader/practitioner worse off then when they started.  I cannot recommend this book ( or the 10-day workshop) to anyone who is feeling down for any reason. Instead, I urge you to call a talk therapist and make an appointment; eat appropriately, get at least seven hours of sleep a night, and make sure you are doing something physical each day, like walking.   It's true, there is nothing wrong with you, but having the direct experience of that truth takes balanced thoughtful effort. Come on Totto, let's go home now 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 The author makes some very good points in this book, but after a while it becomes difficult to separate fact from fiction.  I wasn't aware, for instance that "...the venom of all other poisonous snakes attacks the blood whereas the venom of the puff adder attacks the nervous system..." (page 302 paperback edition).  Really?  I thought there were many species of snakes that had neurotoxin venom, but what do I know?  I'm just a scientist.  But he doesn't stop there.  He goes on to tell a tear-jerking tale about an incident with General George Patton wherein he describes Patton's voice as "low and rasping".  Sorry, but that was George C. Scott.  As a matter of actual fact, General Patton was very self-conscious of his rather high-pitched reedy voice.  And where in the world did this man who claims to have made multiple visits to Italy come up with the idea that there are no protestant churches (or any other religions for that matter) in that country?  Unfortunately, this work is rife with  such fabrications and delusions.  And then there are the quotes -- either he has an unparalled power of recall or he greatly embellishes many lengthly quotes.  After a while, this work begins to take on the characterists of a quasi-religious "Forrest Gump".  Perhaps some day a good biography of John Paul I will be written, but this one is definitely not it. 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 This remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me.  I used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor. Ouch. However, the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor.  The design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils. I have owned Norelco and Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave 
 The Light of Other Days, ostensibly co-authored by Arthur C. Clarke, is marketed as a philosophically intriguing tale of the transformation of Earth society in the not-so-distant-future, upon the advent of a remote viewing technology that removes all pretense of privacy from people's lives, and even allows observing events in the past. This is an enticing premise, but it's all downhill from page 1. In fact, the premise is all that's left after you discard the juvenile writing style, the paper-thin plot, the one-dimensional characters, and the Discover magazine-grade science.  I actually gave up on it halfway through, after enduring chapter after chapter of egregious exposition. Relentless, finger-wagging infodumps in dialogue and newscasts read like the following (paraphrased, but not the least bit exaggerated): "'As you know, David, the warning signs of global warming went unheeded way back in the early 2000s, and now there's a permanent El Niño.' 'Why yes, Kate, not only is England, which had to become the 52nd U.S. state after international trade collapsed, locked in ice, but more than 60% of the earth's land is no longer farmable.'" The most blatant morality plays in Star Trek aren't even this bad. These passages are also buffered by a superfluous sex scene that tries to appeal to women, but was clearly written by a man.  And then there's this gem of dialogue, at which point the book cannot be taken any less seriously: "It's like what happened to the copyright laws with the advent of the Internet. You remember that? ... No, you're too young. The Global Information Infrastructure--the thing that was supposed to replace the Berne copyright convention--collapsed back in the nought-noughts. Suddenly the Internet was awash with unedited garbage. Every damn publishing house was forced out of business, and all the authors went back to being computer programmers, all because suddenly somebody was giving away for free the stuff they used to sell to earn a crust."  Yeah, 2001 or Rendezvous With Rama this is not; it's nowhere near the quality of Clarke's own masterworks, or any others in the genre, for that matter. That said, though, had this been marketed as a teen/preteen volume, I think it would be tolerable. However, I expected far more sophistication from an adult work, especially one with Clarke's name on it. Save your cash and wait for the TV movie 
 Didn't like this book-- honestly i prefer to hear alan lecture, so far none of his books have had the impact that him speaking has for me 
 the title pretty much says it all. read blackhawk down instead.. 
 Although this text may be of assistance to some, it may also be used incorrectly and the criteria set forth in the DSM-IV-R is stringent, complete, and also complex.  Do not confuse this edition for the one you will need when working the psych ward or in higher education seeking a degree in a psych or psychiatric related field 
 My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event! 
 Captain Alatriste is the first in a series and, like a lot of series, you're really rooting for it to be a barnburner so you can go right out and buy the next one and then wait breathlessly for the one after that.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with Captain Alatriste.  The problem is that there isn't enough of Captain Alatriste in Captain Alatriste.  It's told through his own Sancho Panza, Inigo, his steady sidekick, who has stories of his own to tell.  But those stories only distract from the main story, which is paper thin to begin with.  Throw in a lot of songs and poems and you've got a sleepy reader 
 I picked up this book with much excitement.  I was looking for excellent historical research, completely unbiased representation of facts, just an overall great, indepth look at the history of christ.  Instead I was extremely disappointed and could not even finish the book.  It is biased beyond belief!  This woman went into writing this book with her particular view and absolute faith in her particular beliefs.  It is not a case of being curious in a subject, doing the research and drawing a conclusion as I had hoped.  It is a case of playing a certain role in this life and retaining no compassion, curiosity, acceptance or understanding of any alternate histories, beliefs, viewpoints, etc. and expelling that specific propaganda on paper.  Very disappointing, very unoriginal, very uninformed.    This book was a complete waste of money and time.  
 I found this one hard going. This is your basic find a lot of oil, oops it's in Cuba, better knock off Castro plot. While character motivation was believable, the characters themselves seemed shapeless. I just could not see a female CEO acting in such a ruthless manner while at same time caring for her employees. AFter a while I just closed my eyes and had a good snooze 
 I was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991; however, I had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had.  The shoe is hard, uncomfortable, and much wider than the 991.  My foot slides around everywhere.  I recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first.  Don't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991 
 Cannot remember a reading a worse book.  Boring, uninteresting story, repetitive dialogue.  The only good think about it is that it is very short 
 The music wasn't bad, however the vocals are a MAJOR disappointment.  I kept expecting something better with each song.  Then I realized the problem; there was no raw feelings conveyed, no personality, no life.  You can't sing blues songs with a polished pop voice 
 It has been said time and again that experience is the best teacher.  Antony Flew, the world's number one atheist (at least with respect to the rare ability to argue his point without using ad hominem arguments) has recanted his atheism.    Philosophically, Flew was a rationalist.  Having accepted the empirical evidence of intelligent design in nature, he was able to liberate himself from the tunnel vision of rationalism and hence from the shackles of irrational atheism.  Flew himself would give this book one star.  So, I don't think it ungracious to do the same 
  Very poorly organized.  Focuses on case studies (like pages and pages about vole hormones and a whole chapter on bird song) rather than concepts.  The writing style is decent, but it's not very comprehensive or clear, and the author makes some mistakes (he misinterprets a critical graph when discussing hyena hormones and ends up with a bad conclusion.  My teacher knows he  screwed it up because she wrote the paper he cites incorrectly).  The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is that my teacher says that, while it is quite bad, there are no better alternatives 
 bought a global knife a few years ago  then bought the water/ ceramic sharpening device. cannot keep this knife sharp. it sits in my block with a bunch of cheap 4 star henckels. I use the cheap sabatiers ($9 for the set and the block)  anway it's no worse than any of my other dull knives just cost mor 
 Here's one more A95 to add to the ever increasing list of E18 failures. Thanks to the horror stories from the other posters I'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired. The camera is only about 2 years old... guess I'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits! The camera really performed nicely when it was working... thus the 2 stars. Hope you have better luck than me if you get one 
 My first question is to whom was Chesnoff addressing this -- I'm reluctant to dignify it by calling it a book? It certainly was not to an adult or anyone possessing any education or intelligence.  Case in point: his interminable English translations of common French expressions and words, as well as his own childish phrases, "hoity-toity" and "keester", just two of literally hundreds of similar expressions commonly discarded after one outgrows the playground.  A suggestion:  Read the first section of the "addenda", "How to Respond to Rude French People" before you buy.  If you are not painfully embarrassed by these juvenile attempts at le sarcasme (sarcasm) (for Richard's benefit), then you are his audience 
 Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut "Lucky To Know You."  "Seeing Through You" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like "Lucky To Know You."  
 My car was stolen with device engaged.  It was stolen while my wife and I were both at home.  We did not hear a single thing.  Their 'guarantee' by the way is a complete farse.  Wow, they'll cover the deductable... but only on a comprehensive coverage policy.  If you are wanting to keep your car safe, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! 
 It's a history book!  If you love Hugh Johnson and love history, you'll love this.  Well I love WINE and really like Hugh Johnson and I can't seem to finish this book 
 The Postman is a very seriously boring movie with terrible story line. One of the most conspicuous flops of its decade and there is good reason for it. I had to write this review when I saw that there were several people actually rating this movie at 5 stars. Seriously guys you forgot to take your pills this morning and your friends will the white coats will be visiting later to check on you, until then please refrain from using your PC as we are in danger of obliteration of good taste 
 I have had it less than a year and charging the battery as with all the palms is a major disappointment.  They don't last very long.  Palm is great but what is great if it doesn't charge.  Thanks to service plans I have exchanged every palm I  have had due to defective batteries now they know better and don't have the plans like they used too.  My advice:  Buy something with a replaceable battery you can do yourself 
 Indeed this is the definitive guide to single malt scotch I was highly disappointed; so much that I actually returned the guide for a refund. For any owner of the guide, please refer to page 144 where the Bowmore selection is located. You'll notice that Bowmore "Darkest", 15-, and 17-year old scotches are missing from the book as well as the prized Bowmore Islay's fromt eh 1050's and 1960's.   Upon investigation I contacted the Bowmore distiller's themselves (Running Press never did return my correspondence) and discovered that the publisher had mistakenly missed 5 pages of the book and they just happened to be the Bowmore section. No fault of the author Michael Jackson.  I do own the 4th Edition and will now have to be patient for the 6th Edition before I will be able to sample my collection fully while making and comparing notes with the guide 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I wanted to buy this for my daughter. I wanted to combine a traditional record book with fill-ins with my new scrapbooking hobby. The outside is precious, but once you open it, the pages are like a black and white newspaper material, and they have no structure what so ever. The pages are boring and don't look very durable 
 This is a beautiful book with filled wonderful ideas.  However, the recipes are very bad.  I am an experienced baker who attempted a few of cakes with along with a chef, whose history includes an honors degreee from the French Culinary Institute in NYC.  We both agree - the recipes are just plain bad.  The directions and instructions are not only vague, they assume you can get from point A to point D.  If you want to make the cakes in this book, find the recipe elsewhere.  I would actually like to know how the author made the cakes in the photographs, because she certainly did not rely on these recipes alone 
 This book is the condensed crib-note version of the Hermetica.  You can read it entirely on one cross town bus trip.  It's enough to peak curiosity, but this is such a small extract of the entire Hermetica that it's nearly useless.  It's just a sound-bite 
 Although I'm a fan of her other works, I found this album extraordinarily flat and unexciting.  The music is mostly trite, with little energy or passion, and much of it sounds like it was turned out on a cheap keyboard synthesizer.  Most disappointing of all, the focus here is not on her violin work, which is sometimes hard to pick out-- if it's there at all -- but on vocals and other pieces which are pleasant in their own way...but not what you buy a Vanessa Mae album for. Pleasant background music, inoffensive, but with none of the spark that makes her other albums so great, and many pieces that are little more than violin-assisted disc 
 Madonna in her pre-Kabbalah phase - check the liner notes -  This collection is garbage.  DANCE Madonna,  DANCE.  (Yawn... 
 I bought this book after reading Immerso's wonderful and insightful book about his hometown of  Newark, New Jersey. His new book on Coney Island was not at all what I expected. It's more like a book report than a book, consisting of bits of information taken from previous Coney books spliced together with trivia from web sites. There appears to be no primary source material or original research. Immerso repeats the traditional Coney Island stories, weaving them into a dry narrative that will be interesting only to someone who is not familiar with Coney Island. The modern color photos are not very good and seem to be used as filler. Overall, Coney Island: The People's Playground is a pedestrian effort by a good writer 
 This book has serious manufacturing defects.  First books pages were not in align, same problem with replacement book.  Amazon must have no quality control, because I do not known how they could miss this.  Amazon was great in replacing book, but sent me another defective book.  Had no other problems with Amazon books in past.  If you order this book expect defects 
 This book as the potential to be a good book, but it forgot the call to action. There are no secret formulas 
 I believe you can find a better auditing textbook in the market. I took an auditing class with one of the authur in Portland and, as a result, was required to buy the textbook. But, I ended up using another auditing textbook in order to get an "A" from this class. The format and writing style are very difficult to follow and understand 
 I happened on this book while just browsing in a bookstore and because I have enjoyed Cornwell's writing in the past, bought it without reading any reviews.  I have learned my lesson.  I was totally disappointed and felt that the story had absolutely no depth and was poorly written.  She (Cornwell) would have been better off to trash this one, as I am sure that this book will give many of her fans a real cause to pause before buying another of her books. A real waste of time and money. 
 Well, after reading the reviews on EVERY "no programming needed" beginner MySQL book available on Amazon.com, I am convinced NONE of them teach a "beginner" anything. Commodore language was my "beginner" programming, but decided to pick it up again.  One thing this book and ALL of these books dont tell you is WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE CODE ONCE YOU WRITE IT? WHERE THE HELL DOES IT GO?  After two years of on-and-off study, I still dont know anything, I just have a stack of books rotting in the garage ready for the next 25-cent rummage sale 
 This work is a mildly interesting collection of semi-familiar "tales." It is so poorly written that it reads like a first draft.  Where was the editor 
 I've had two Hamilton Beach products. The first was Brew Master, which we wanted because the coffee is dispensed through a coffee carafe at the top of the machine. However, the carafe is plastic with seams and after 4 months began to leak all over the counter. Hamilton Beach replaced the carafe, but the new one leaked again after 4 months. We then demanded a Stay or Go Thermal Coffeemaker. I had it for two or three weeks and then as I was washing it out with hot water and a bottle sponge, the glass vacuum liner blew up with a bang! Glass shards scattered all over the sink and kitchen floor. I was lucky not to have gotten shards in my eyes. Please look out for this one! I'm only buying stainless steel carafes from now on 
 I bought this toy for my 9 month old son for Christmas. He loved it and it is a wonderful toy. However, in mid January it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit. I replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still wouldn't work. I tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing. I had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium.com and finally just emailed amazon. They responded quickly and it appears that I will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that I may take my chances and buy it again. There are mixed reviews some saying that it is durable and works great and a few like mine 
 Unfortunately, I forked out $14 for this CD.  Upon first listen I am extremely dissapointed.  Being a huge fan of SP for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of Green's previous work.  Also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist.  Use this as Sunday background music on a rainy day; but do not expect to get the party started with this album... 
 Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.    
 This book does not explain how an Imam from England can say,  'If Allah tells me to condemn terrorism, I will condemn terrorism"!  This book does not explain that while not all Muslims are terrorist, most terrorist are Muslims!  This book truly is trying to lull Americans into a false since of Security.  
 Don't waste your money (even just 10 bucks).  The plastic is not rip-stop and tears very easily.  I will now just use a big, heavy duty, black trash can liner - they are much stronger 
 Product ad states 64 pods but they only shipped 16! When I called all they would refund was shipping, then I complained and they said $8 refund. So I asked for a return shipping lable and FULL refund. The CSR Amy was kind but her options from J&R were unacceptable 
 "In Her Day" is feminism at her worst. The story follows the romantic tryst between Isle, a 20-something activist zealously fighting the cause for women's rights, and Carole, the experienced, 40-something art professor who has figured out how to choose her battles wisely. Together the two argue women's ideologies. That's about it. Add a cast of quirky-but- lackluster characters and you've got a novel doesn't amount to much. There was just too much opinion and not enough emotion. There was nothing human about the characters that made me care about them. Definitely not a good read as I labored through it far longer than I should 
 This is the worst sequel I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the first one ,but did it have to be this cheesy and boring. They aged mia, got rid of michael, threw her together with some loser, and made up some bogus law about marriage. I was really disappointed 
 I'm a Conan Doyle fan and found The Alienist to be a pretty good read, so I made the unfortunate mistake of buying this book in softcover without taking a gander inside. Carr seems to think he can ride his reputation for 316 pages without putting much thought into whether anyone along for the trip will get some enjoyment out of it. The dialogue is flat, the plot uncompelling and Carr relies on the near-endless use of exclamation points to inject some excitement!!! into this tale, which left me skipping pages at a time as it neared its conclusion because I couldn't bear to read the mangled sentences. This book has no climax -- just, thankfully, an ending. Spend your money on something worth reading. 
 I saw on the internet a picture of chingy rapping on stage and a notorious porn transvestite with HIS hand on chingy's crotch. Now I knew chingy couldn't rap his way out of a wet paper bag but I never questioned his manhood. Now that I saw the picture and read the article about Chingy and his transvestite lover I am so done with him. I hope the reviews he gets encourages him to find another occupation. This album is classic garbage and would be a perfect coaster for the next party you have at your house 
 Quoting the first 2 sentences of the book:  "In the American system, citizens were taught that the transfer of political power accompanied elections, formal events when citizens made orderly choices about who shall govern. Very few Americans, therefore, understood that the transfer of power might also occur, more subtly, without elections."  Unfortunately, Greider is right about most Americans' stunning ignorance about how they're really governed, although one could argue that more and more people are waking up to the fact that all is not as it seems on the surface. So far, so good - but then, in the next paragraph, without mentioning the Federal Reserve by name, he says:  "It was part of the national government, yet deliberately set outside the electoral process, insulated from the control of mere politicians."  Good propaganda must be mostly truth to work. As I write, this book has a rating of 4 1/2 stars out of 5. This is an indication that the majority of reviewers have bought into the well spun propaganda Greider delivers.  The Federal Reserve is a 100% privately owned corporation, carefully set up to appear as though it is an arm of government. It was created solely for the benefit of it's shareholders, a significant proportion of which are foreign. Greider could have mentioned this extremely important fact at the outset. Instead he deliberately helps perpetuate the myth that "The Fed" is public.  He spends the rest of the 700+ pages going into excruciating detail about The Fed's decisions and their direct effects on the economy, with a focus on the time of Volcker's reign. If that's what you're looking for, this is the book for you. If you're looking for true insight into The Fed, its origins, who it benefits, and how it directly controls the largest economy in the world (and indirectly many other economies through their privately owned central banks) at the expense of everyone else, then I'd suggest reading "The Creature from Jekyll Island".  Why 1 star? I don't like propaganda deliberately designed to mislead people who are seeking truth about a subject which affects all of us. The few citizens that take the time to research a subject so important to all of us deserve better than to be distracted by true  - but on the whole, irrelevant - information 
 A great portion of the book is very boring. I really felt like rushing through the book. I don't recommend this book to other 
 A woman is killed shortly after the main character meets her for the first time. The killer is caught quickly and sent to jail but the main character suspects that there is something wrong. Sounds good on first glance.  The book is called "borrowed time" which does not describe the pace or quality of the book but is more an adequate description of what this book does to your patience!  How is it possible that the author needs almost 250 pages to describe a time span of 3 years when absolutely nothing happens that contributes to the possible riddle of the murder in the story or the entertainment of the reader? No events, nothing even remotely interesting, no romance, no jokes, no nothing!  Then a surprising confession of the (possible) real killer offers the chance to speed up the pace of the story and make up for the outstanding boredom before. Too bad that exactly the opposite happens and the book manages to be even more dreary then before.  The book could be summarized in less than 20 pages and might make an interesting short story but with over 440 pages it is only good for people having trouble falling asleep or those who like to use "satisfaction-or-you-money-back-guaranties".  This is without a shadow of a doubt the most boring book I read in 2003. In the end the only riddle to me still is: why did I finish it?? 
 Very limited photo touch up. When it comes time to burn you might as well have customer service on the phone. Pretty much a total piece of crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I am sorry to say, my expectations for this book were rather high I guess.  There just isn't much content in this book.  The number of illustrations are quite few and rather poorly drawn.  The text is as expected, mostly sarcastic and full of quip and clever rhetoric, however it comes a bit light when the authors attempt to grapple with the technical in describing the various bits.   Was expecting more.  Disappointed.  (the book didn't even talk about the Japanese submarine aircraft carrier, and that project actually did see the light of day 
 This book tries, but fails. The jokes are dry. Humor is dated. I couldn't finsih it. The story had nothing to pull me in. Get Sophie Kinsella instead, you will be much happier 
 i got disappointed, no colors at all !! i thought I will find a colorful calender , but ended up with the a black and while one :( no space to write the full name only the first letter of each member in the house. I got the mom's calendar last year and was really nicer 
 I did not read the book but just flipped through it and I felt like stating my opinion. The book is just a collection of commonsense advices cloaked in quotations from scriptures. You don't need a $16 book to tell you 1. Have a mentor (My Note: No you dn't need one) 2. Carry a book with you all the time (My Note: meaningless advice) etc Better free advice is available online or in Project Gutenberg 
 This book is awful.  It is a depressing collection of depressing horrible stories.  It's not even the splash of dark Christmas humor I expected, it is just a compilation of depresseed people who attemped to make a book.  A person is much better off reading Holidays on the Rocks or an Idiot Girl Christmas, much more enjoyable dark humored Christmas books.  Basically, if you are looking to be amused, don't read this.  If you want to induce depression, then maybe.  The stories are of all winter holidays which is an interesting twist, but those stores were also, equally awkwardly composed.  It's just a really depressing, awkward read that is not what the advertising leads one to believe.  No wonder the back of thh book reviews are from fictitious sources and not critically authored.  It's that bad 
 I had ordered two of this item and then changed my mind and returned both for credit.  When the credit was processed I only received credit for one. It has been very difficult to contact the correct person to get this error corrected.  Your assistance in clearing this issue will be greatly apapreciated.  I know you are not the correct department but I am hoping you can forward my message to the correct area for processing of credit to my account.  Thank you Joanne Woodma 
 You gotta love a political pundit like Joe Klein.  He didn't even have the decency to attach his name to his book.  Wow, that's courage.  That's a backbone.   Let's see, Klein goes around slamming the Clinton presidency, anonymously.  Thanks, Joe.  America needs more brave souls like you.  Go back to writing your drivel in Time Magazine.  Frankly I am surprised you have the courage to attach your name to your columns. 
 While some of his reviews are descriptive, some of the ratings he gives are freakin rediculous. This guy only gives Duvel 2.9, but gives Heineken a 3.4....what the? Duvel is regarded by many to be one of the best Belgian strong pale ales in the world, while quite the opposite could be said of Heineken.  I bought this book for 25 cents from the library, but it wouldn't be worth any more than that. You're better off spending your money on anything written by Michael Jackson 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 The book may be easy to read and a good overview of the ZONE diet plan, but...  the first recipe I've tried, vegetarian lasagna, turned out to be a disaster.  To begin with, the ingredient list is faulty.  It calls for 3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning, but in the procedure, you only use 3  teaspoons.  It then tells you to blend the cottage cheese until smooth -  what cottage cheese - it was never on the ingredient list?   Finally,  right when you now know something is definetly off with the recipe and your  assembling the noodles, etc. - IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE PAN.  So much for  40/30/30 for tonight's dinner and the two hours in the kitchen.  The recipe  was a good idea and I'm interested in a solution if you ever read this Ms.  Gittleman 
 This is an absolute mess,this is beyond terrible and how this sold 5 million copies is beyond me. I just heard this clown saying the new Nas album is garbage and talking trash about Jay-Z and Jadakiss.I hope this bonehead's new album flops big time, and hope the new Wu-Tang album coming this summer blows it away.People got to start getting into lyrical rap again it's scary to think the youth today think G-Unit is best thing going.My favourite rappers are Nas,Gza,Big Pun,Big L and AZ and they blow away 50 cent 
 As an adult, I now understand the meaning of this book; but as a child I actually understood the story to mean that being ugly was bad and made you unloveable and that being pretty was important and made you loveable 
 It never ceases to amaze me how these books get published. The narrative is pedestrian and the plot implausible. Now don't get me wrong - I'm not looking for high lit here but come on - "Sweat glistened in small beads atop her skin"!!! My advice for anyone looking for a good read in this genre - reread Frederick Forsyth. For that matter, Clive Cussler is better than this nonsense. And don't get me started on Dan Brown 
 Application is dual input from cable TV input and analog PC input, used as side monitor on a triple screen home computer workstation.  1) Audio output stops intermittently a few times a week, requiring power off/on to regain audio.  2) There appears to be no way to disable unused source modes.  To switch from computer input to TV input requires one push of the Source button...... but then to return to computer input requires 4 button pushes - as the TV cycles thru AV, S-Video, Component modes, and finally back to PC mode.  A weak design - the unit should recognize which input is enabled - it is not possible to hook up all 5 modes.  This is particularly irritating as this model was marketed as a TV/PC monitor.  Picture quality is acceptable for the application, which is primarily watching news channels while working at PC, or displaying dual PC applications 
 Hmm, quite a disappointment, especially after splurging on the hardcover edition.  Set as a kind of "Rockies Rear Window," this is one slow story.  Endless pages of crazy-making when I'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through.  Finally skipped ahead to finish the book.  I had really looked forward to Angels Fall, too :(  If you are a Roberts fan, don't spend the money on the hardcover, wait for the paperback, go to the library, or borrow from a friend.  Not worth the price. 
 I am a long time fan of le Carre - have read and loved all his books - until this one. I just could not summon the interest to finish it. Yes, I'm sort of curious about why this guy's wife was killed, but not curious enough to wade through all the documents and emails et cetera ad nauseum along with him to get there. I was on vacation and had nothing else to do, yet still, I could not wade through this mind-numbing book. I got about half way through - did I quit reading too soon? Did it suddenly pick up after that?  If you're new to John le Carre, start with an earlier book - seriously. Because he's a wonderful writer, really 
 The book I received in July, 2006 was published in 2004 - NOT 2005, as indicated. It doesn't contain contain any information that you can't get from other guidebooks - and the information on specific sites is sketchy. Maybe it is useful if you plan on touring on a motorcycle, but otherwise, there are more current guidebooks covering the same places more effectively 
 I just got this book and I'm very disappointed; even thought, I haven't prepared a thing. There is some picture but it doesn't reference the name of the food that's in the picture. How do I suppose to know the recipes of the food that's in the picture? For most of the pages, it doesn't have a picture of the food....it only recipes. I don't know how the food will be taste like or looks like? If there's a picture, you would say that's looks good but there's no picture. There are millions of recipes, do we suppose to know what's good or not; without providing a picture or sampling it? When a food looks good, people will try to prepare it. If you not a Thai, then you will be very disappointed because you'll not know what your food looks like when you try to prepare it 
 We did this book in a bookclub.  The language in the book was a bit rough I thought and it was just plain weird.  Would not recommend this book for anyone to read. 
 As someone learning to play drums and interested in African rhythms, I must say that this book was quite a let down. It offers very little useful information on drumming itself, and the ideas it does offer (the 12  principles) are expressed in uninteresting ways, lacking in subtlety. If  you're interested in a book that offers insight into the meaning of African  drumming, avoid this book and look to John Chernoff's African Rhythm and  African Sensibility 
 When I was incubating yoghurt and or monitoring the temperature of some beer, the thermometer works fine.  Of course, this is for temperatures below 140 degrees Fahrenheit.    When I tried to use the thermometer for making beer, it finally gave out.  Having not used it in a few days, it currently reads 160 degrees.  It's busted and I've only had it since January.    Some liquid was spilled on it, and the thing completely died.  Ultimately, the battery was replaced, and the device was left to dry.  It managed to recover from that, but it made me nervous.  Maybe I'm expecting too much from digital thermometers, but I would expect it could handling boiling water.  I was using the probe to monitor some mash I was preparing for beer.  That is what ultimately killed it.  This thermometer also advertises that it can handle candymaking.  This might be true, but I don't consider fudge that tastes like carbon to be "candy." It just lags too much for candymaking, and it didn't accurately display the temperature of the warm, sweet liquid since the probe couldn't be kept completely imersed while I stirred.  I have to dig up the warranty and see if there's anything that can be done about this probe.  I'm assuming I'm out of luck.  I'd recommend looking into a more robust thermometer, if you can find one 
 This item does not work.  It does absolutely nothing.  I bought one and then was sent a second one. Neither one works.  It was a gift and I felt so bad that I gave someone a gift that didn't work 
 If you want to see Mr. Milan demonstrate his personal rapport with animals, this DVD will fill the bill.  However, if you are seeking advice and instruction on how to overcome aggression in your pet, this DVD will not be of much help.  The DVD is really nothing but an infommercial praising Mr. Milan's talents. I seriously doubt that the dogs he works with in the DVD maintain their non-aggressive behavior after he leaves. The strategies he uses, such as having the aggressive dog walk beside his non-aggressive pack dog, are not practical for the average dog owner. If someone were going to hire Mr. Milan as a personal dog trainer, this item would certainly serve as a recommendation, but it is woefully lacking as step-by-step instruction on how to overcome aggression in a dog 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 This book is a journal of a young woman (now a movie actor), born in Afghanistan, and her life as a child and teenager in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Canada.  it is very disorganized, and does not give much analysis of the political problems in Afghanistan and Pakistan which cause such misery to her family and the population.  Much description of squalid living.  There does not seem to be much hope for Afghanistan, now that the educated people have left for safer countries 
 This book is better than nothing but there is a lot of room for improvement regarding quality.  It went a long way towards helping me pass the 70-536 exam.  This book has an alarming number of typos in it, tends to gloss over some important items, and is missing some key exam items.  I bought this because I didn't want to wait months and months for other resources to become available.  If you can wait I suggest you do 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
 In short, the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware of the evils of war and the fact that the international community is often slow to act. At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination of the situation on the ground, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create. What the film ends up doing is the one thing it must avoid at all cost in order to be effective: NOT to choose sides.  The Catholic Croats and the Muslims are the "victims," while the Orthodox Serbs are wholly to blame...  That is neither witty nor wise when trying to carry out a "noble cause."  There is a term used in such situations and it's called... propaganda! A more balanced and objective approach (i.e. there are no good guys and bad guys in such conflicts) with less bias and closed mindedness would have made the film more effective and therefore, more successful. The ultimate goal is good, but the method used is not necessarily the correct one. Another setback is in relation to the acting (or lack of it); that is to say that the cast are badly in need of acting lessons (with the exception of Woody Harrelson)!  The acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...  School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!  It is truly sad... Yet another weakness is in relation to the very poor dialogues and the weak plot/storyline for which the writers and director are to blame. In conclusion, the potential for a good movie was there if only the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!  A shame really...     
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 I have had both the S5000 and the S5100 I was disapointed when my S5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months, but I was happy with the picture quality. I replaced it with the S5100, it has a slightly better feature set over the S5000 (in particular shutter speed choices) while on a trip to Niagara Falls, I was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt (and I mean slight) after that it wouldn't power up. I am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable. 
 This book is a joke.  It is written by a guy who has followed Colin Powell around and has taken a lot of notes on what he has said.  He then put together a bunch of Powell's stories and comments into this book.  The "secrets" are not secrets at all.  They are common sense to most people.  After the first couple of chapters I realized that I was wasting my time trying to read each word and just went to the summaries at the end of each chapter.  It's all summed up there.  Powell did not contribute to this book, he was merely a speaker who fed the author enough information to pull this book together 
 We have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there. There is no rhyme or reason to the story. I gave it two stars because the landscape is great 
 I had heard a lot about how funny Margaret Cho was, and finally got a chance to watch her video. I find her way overrated.  She does have some funny stuff. She's got a particular knack for doing impressions, and there's some other genuinely funny material.  However, the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience. She does a lot of vulgar material, homosexual-oriented jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the "outlaw" value. And she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base. It's just... not funny. 
 I generally like Sheldon's "beach" reads.  Usually great fun which decent premises.  I'm not hard to please.  However, this offering was dismal.  Storylines were picked up and dropped without resolution.  Most of the characters were grossly underdeveloped or mere stereotypes.  You know going into a Sheldon book that it's not going to be an English Lit assignment, but this one was weak in comparison with his other selections 
 Disappointing. This book is not particularly well-written. Heller waxes majestically about the scenery and topography he sees, but I still can't visualize it. And he shifts his voice several times throughout the book, sometimes writing as if he were delivering sacred text, other times casually reaching out and attempting to speak to the reader one-on-one. It's hard to get a feel for the story he's trying to tell. Add that to the fact that there is not a single compelling character in the book and it makes it a little tough to slog through. I find that I just don't care what happens to these people. And this may sound silly, but an adventure book without pictures of the location is a bad idea. I hate to sound like I'm in 4th grade, but it would have been really helpful to have some visual aids to understand the geography they were in and the effect of the water on their kayaking. No photos. It hurts the book 
 he book cover makes prominent note of a website, which is still not available, three years after pub. date, and has never been.  There is some useful info., though not very much, and certainly not enough to justify it's price. It is not well organized, nor well-written or laid out (and printed with a cheap typeface on cheap paper--like a Dover paperback, if you've seen them).  The arguments regarding animal fat, as another reviewer from Boston wrote, are less than convincing.  The book starts out with highly technical chemical information which is of little interest to lay readers. There is useful information on the benefits of tropical oils and the misrepresentation of fats on nutrition labels, which is helpful  However, you might learn more about tropical oils, for free, from, say, the Spectrum Naturals website 
 Man, oh man, I think this is one of the worst books I've ever read.  If I could give The Thanatos Syndrome negative stars, I would!  Seriously, half way through, I came to Amazon to see how bad other people thought it was.  Boy was I shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive!  I found the book bizarre, unfocused and poorly written.  The volcabulary repeatedly seems misused.  The plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that US funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation.  The physics, engineering, psychology, medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic.  Characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome, only to have them dissipate.  And so on.  The characters don't even seem like real people.  For example, the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain, and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are.  How could someone know a person that well, but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood?  Or:  one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them.  C'mon, if the guys a nut (and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking 'duck' to them is nuts!), write him as a nut the whole way through, don't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book's climax!  The book's title isn't even explained, for crying out loud.  Thanatos means death in Greek, I believe, but I could never understand what the author/editors/audience thought was dying.  I won't read this one again, nor will I look for anything else by Percy Walker.  
 We've had this timer for a couple years now, maybe a little longer. It's really cute. It does ring really loud. But lately it's taken to STOPPING before it should, i.e., it just STOPS! No ring! Nothing! We've known our food is done when we've smelled things burning! And it never WAS very good at timing things for less than 10 minutes...it often did the same thing, that is, just stop, without ringing. But it was SO CUTE! We kept it and dealt with it. But not anymore. Nope! I'm on-line today looking for a different style chicken timer 
  This is THE BEST SELLING Bible in America for good reason! Ease of comprehension, lovely modern English, pleasing packaging, and the best conservative scholarhip for both textual reconstruction and language translation.  Read I WAS A TEENAGE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS and JEHOVAH UNMASKED for two of the wildest rides ever!  
 This is the second book that I have bought written by Kevin Ames.  This is a very big disappointment, and quite unlike the previous version of the same title.  So, what's wrong?  The text is nearly unreadable the fonts are all over the place, the sizes of the fonts chosen are way too large.  Frankly, I wish I had my money back.    Now the other side, Kevin's work is ground breaking.  His suggestions about improving skin texture are to be found no where else.  His technique is unsurpassed.  I want to be sure that I make that clear.  I also have his video from Software Cinema.  So, one more time; Kevin is great!  The book is useless to me, because the graphics are just bad.  Would I buy another Kevin Ames book?  Yes, but I would not buy it sight unseen.  Jerry Ree 
 I bought this machine after researching it for a long time.  I could deal with the hard cleaning of it, I was willing to shell out $100.00 for a good quality maker, and I loved the design.  After two or three uses it started to leak.  After much searching I realized the caraf itself was leaking into the electronics and causing it to short.  I paid too much and do not like the fact that it broke so quickly. I didn't return it, I just will NEVER buy bodum again 
 I think the machine was great at first. It's fast and eficient, but if you have more than 5 lb.of meat to grind and you don't want smoke coming out from the motor,  You might want to give it a break in between. Plus, the cutting plates and the feed screw turn rusting and black even you put cooking oil  after wash as directed by the instruction book, and they have this iron/metal smell on the cutting plate that contaminate the meat. I am very disappointed. 
 This book took me a long time to finish, almost a month, I think. It is slow paced and tends to spin off as if they took a lot of filler from other books that was edited out and crammed them in here.  Spinning towards a vapid, hippie ending, it does nothing to save itself from being God awful. Tragically, I think this was a best seller.   D 
  I REGRET TO SAY THE UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DID US NO FAVOR WHEN THEY PUBLISHED THIS BOOK. I WAS EXPECTING A FINE NARRATIVE ON THE HISTORY OF COMMUNITY COOKBOOKS AND INSTEAD PLOWED THROUGH A DISSERTAION ON FEMINISM, PERSONAL CULTURAL ATTITUDES AND DOWN-RIGHT BORING TRIVIA MIXED IN WITH A FEW FACTS THAT WOULD BE WORTH YOUR TIME IF THEY WEREN'T BURIED IN THE THESIS STYLE OF WRITING. WHAT A PITY TO RUIN A GOOD BASIC SUBJECT WITH ACADEMIA DRIBBLE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. IT WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON A GOOD COMMUNITY COOKBOOK THAT BENEFITS YOUR FAVORITE OGANIZATION 
 I only read through the first third of the book before I had to give up on it.  Often the authors overgeneralize - they take a statement made to them by one person of color and then say that all people of color feel the same way.  That's not only counterproductive, it borders on perpetuating racism.  They have a very negative mindset that I find to be discouraging.  My husband and I are considering transracial adoption of an older child; if I continue to read this book, I am certain they would talk me out of it.  Plus, I find this book to be very poorly written.  It lacks any coherent organization.  This book is in desperate need of an editor.  Even if you agree with their approach to the issues, the typos, poor grammar and lack of structure will certainly make it difficult to follow their thought process.  Unless James Joyce's stream of consciousness writing style is appealing to you, you will not enjoy the way the authors jump topics every other paragraph.  There are much better books dealing with these issues available.  The only redeeming quality of this book is the quotes from children and adults who were raised in multiracial families 
 These Brava anthologies get worse every time. It seems to me that two or three anthologies not unlike this one featuring pretty much the same authors are released every month. I noticed that some of the stories in Merry Christmas, Baby are not only undeveloped and too short for me to care about the characters, but they are also recycled. It is obvious to me that these authors are running out of ideas because this imprint makes them churn out crap at hyper speed. Donna Kaufman's Making Waves and Erin McCarthy's You, Actually are the better ones in this book. I was very disappointed with MaryJanice Davidson in this one. Undercover Claus is Santa Claws from Ellora's Cave's Naughty or Nice anthology, but with some minor alterations. The funny thing is that I read that Naughty or Nice anthology just a few days before reading this book. I can't help losing respect for an author who doesn't even bother to write an original story. I still love her work, but I shall read the stuff she writes for Berkley and for e-imprints in the future. I will read one of her Brava novels only if the plot is interesting (The Royal Treatment, which she wrote for Brava, was actually very good). The Lucy Monroe, Susanna Carr, and Nancy Warren novellas aren't any better. Having read Jingle Bell Rock last year, I should have known better than to read this one. Lucky for me, I borrowed this from a friend to amuse myself during the ninety-minute train ride to work. I suppose that this book was entertaining enough for work travel, but I couldn't help experiencing deja vu while I read the stories and a lot of the passages within them. I won't read any more of these Brava anthologies. They should give these authors some space to actually come out with good, or at least decent, material in the future. For the time being, I recommend the Secret anthologies from Red Sage Publishing 
 A very linear story and not very captivating. This book is definitely being returned. By ODA 391's own admission, if it had not been for the Javelin and some incredibly poorly aimed direct fire and artillery fire from the enemy Roughneck would've been toast.  There is nothing really insightful, we learn basically nothing about each character and their individuality other than Major X being completely incompetent in the battlefield. The only saving grace of the book and of the lives saved was the excellent work borne by the SF Medics. Look elsewhere to find something interesting, captivating and insightful 'cause you armchair warriors won't find it here 
 Great design but unfortunately wouldn't stay stuck in cold temperatures - I have a Saturn and the vent clip was not an option for me 
 I must add a comment to the reviewer above. You cannot argue with cliches. A cliche is a cliche, and if you can't see those phrases are cliches, then you haven't read enough. But then again, if you like dull, cliched writing, have a blast.   I bought this book based on these feeble minded reviews. This novel is filled with cliches and HORRIBLY edited! This is the writing of a novice writer, something you'd expect from a subsidy press. Don't believe me? On page 12, there are over 25 cliches in a single paragraph, and it doesn't stop there. It keeps going and going for 397 horrible overwritten sloppy prose. Here are some of the cliches, about Filius's father pulling him out of the water:  "A violent thunderstorm tore up the sky. Dark clouds, heavy and slow, despite the screaming wind... like a bouquet of black roses." (um, like is there anything original here? Just count the number of cliches- I shall continue, but 7 cliches here)  "A roll of thunder ended with a bang he felt deep in his chest."- 3 cliches in a row! Wow! "The lake churned below..." "He looked up into the black gloom..." "The welts of brightness that shattered the sky..." "lulled by the rhythmic pouinding that beat in his ears...  washing over the pier." this time it's 4 for 4! "For a moment he was swimming in air- weightless..." 2 for 2!  And it goes on and on, and this isn't even all the cliches in this one paragraph even! C'mon people! Anyone who can't see this is abysmal writing doesn't know what they are talking about. Any halfway decent editor should have caught this, but it just goes to show how bad editors are. For a novel being praised as one that 'constructs vivid lives as well as the heart and breadth of the country' is certainly not going to get it here, in this novel. This prose is flat and dull, and no editor should have deluded poor Bruce into thinking he has any writing talent. A novel like this just confirms the horror that passes for fiction today. The dialoge, too, consists of a bunch of card-board cut outs and stereotypes and overwritten, dull descriptive cliches that serve no purpose. (Such as this rote description of this woman in a bathtub looking at her pubic hair, that is neiter 1) described well, nor 2) has anything of insight to offer. What is the point? Merkoff has nothing to say, for not even he knows. Again, where are the editors? But let me end with the brilliance of (from page 115):   "...rain became mixed with blood...scarlet drops turning pink with skydriven water. Rain and blood. And the storm was upon them."  Cue the 2001 Space Odyssey music. Foreboding is it? I think not. What laziness. Go make some popcorn. 
 Let me start by stating that I am a highly liberal person, with a very leniant view on sex - with no sexual hang ups or anal-retentiveness, and even I was thrown off guard by this (let's say it)--Crappy book. This book was brought to my college-level children's literature class (we were discussing banned books.)  I was highly surprised at how lewd the drawings were (not to mention inaccurate,) and that there was even a portion of the book dedicated to sexual positions.  This book replaced our former book (Anna Day and the O-Ring) as the worst book ever published.  Please do yourself a favor and find any other way to educate your children on Sex.  Heck, it would be better to let them watch Nip/Tuck, at least they would get an accurate depiction of what sex is like.   
 A one star rating is way too high for this CD 
 I enjoyed this book because of the way she blended history with a good story that keep you readin

 Too bad the title was wasted on this one. Don't bother reading this unless you want to read long, drawn-out exposition of efforts at preserving various farms and wilderness in the New England states and buildings and parks in NYC. The research was light, no real thesis put forth - some garble about "simultaneous perception" that's forgotten after the first chapters hardly counts. It's not that the writing is offensive, but it is a bit boring and provincial, and lacking in unity and focus 
 The worst book I've read (actually, I was listening to the audiobook).  The characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that I found myself YELLING at the tape player, "I KNOW, I KNOW ALREADY".  I couldn't stand the torture anymore, I didn't even finish it.  I have enjoyed some of DS's earlier work, but will not buy another 
 While the Curious George portion of this video is ok (my daughter loves it).  The other stories are downright morbid and creepy.  They gave me nightmares, let alone my kid.  I don't understand why such weirdness was lumped together with something as wholesome as Curious George 
 Although there seems to be some validity to a number of Mr. Carrol's arguments, he has taken the easy road on most subjects.  As an example of his approach; Modern Medicine's chemical approach can be proven incorrect by one of the most common treatments.  Headaches are not inherently caused by a lack of tylenol (Excedrine etc.) in your dietary intake and therefore cannot "cure" your headaches(Despite the fact they may render you asymptomatic temporarily).  If the body gets an infection we take an NSAID to lower our temperature which in turn allows these organisms to live longer at their preferred temperature, therefore medical approaches should be looked at as unscientific by nature.?? Despite the truth to those very common approaches in modern medicine, we don't disregard or walk sideways into our doctor's office.  Quid pro quo Mr. Carrol, books looking at the negative side of any issue are fairly easy to scribe, a devil's advocate follow-up would be a nice factual read on most of your subjects. Dr. Michael Peterson   (PhD) 
 Total waste of money, unless the only thing you want to do with this system is connect it to another Creative Labs product, like one of their PC cards. This system cannot be connected with anything else, be warned. 
 The book reads like a series of very shallow popular magazine articles. I felt like I was wasting my time, and just skimmed most of it after the first few chapeters 
 What a waste. Sacco could reach a much wider audience if he had written essays. But, wait...does he have the talent to write essays? Being "cool & edgy" apparently has more meaning to him than making a legitimate difference in the world, in general, and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically. Additionally, he is both biased and sexist in his writing 
 With such wonderful illustrations, and a mostly enjoyable text, it's too bad that this book gets its inspiration from "Twas The Night Before Christmas". Jewish parents work hard teaching their children that Chanukah IS NOT the Jewish Christmas. This book doesn't help. There are much better choices out there 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 Ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up. I first bought the book, 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on, so i bought the audiobook (5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on).  Now im stephen kings No1 fan and have loved the majority of his work, the talisman for me was a fantastic bolt on to the dark tower quest. So naturally i thought this would be the same. The book is one of the slowest drawn out books ive ever came accross, not a patch on previous work. I forced myself through the book expecting more, and im sorry to say this one doesnt deliver on any horror, excitment etc, do yourself a favour, get a tin of paint and watch it dry - more happens in that and at a much quicker pace than it does in this book. This book is for die hard fans only... but even diehards will find this a chore 
 "A healthy, well-educated child will grow up empowered and less likely to want or need that AK-47..."  Wow, John Kerry is posting on here now!  Only stupid people want or need guns.  Just like the military !!!   Way to go, John.   Make sure that those of a lesser class understand their place and standing in your "progressive" society ...  You guys just don't get it.  The social issues ARE what's important 
 If you read the dedication, you understand why she wrote this book.  However, she has placed too much emphasis on her agenda, and that really distracts from the hetero relationship of the book.  Like another reviewer below, I love her books, but don't think this is her best romance novel.  I really didn't care about either person in the hetero relationship, and was far too distracted by the other relationship in the book.  I understand that she may want to promote understanding and compassion for gay relationships, but I don't read romance novels to get schooled in liberal thought (and didn't need an education in broadmindedness).  I read them for hot, steamy hetero couples.  Frankly, I didn't like the setting for this one (a movie stage), either.  The last time she did a book based on acting/the stage ("Heart Throb"), I was equally unimpressed.  I thought the male lead was wimpy, which is why I'm such a fan of the Seal books she has done.  This Seal book is definitely a let-down 
 You have to like science and like to read about it, then u might possibly enjoy this book. However, if you dont like science don't read it. My school assaigned us sophmores to read it over the summer, and I hated it, but im not a science or math type person, in fact I would fully love it if I didn't have to take them at all 
 Well I hope Christ is nicer to Michael than Ronnie was. Ronnie once famously asked which one is mine when visiting Michael at camp, not knowing which of the boys was his adopted son. Presumably on the day of judgement Christ won't ask Michael "Which one are you?"... I've always cut Michael some slack despite his pandering conservative views and his seemingly insatiable thrist to milk his connection to his father for every last dime he can hustle. And in a way it is refreshing to see Michael still throwing himself at Ronnie's cowboy boots even after his passing. Then again there are still dollars to be made which brings us back to this book. The sob story presented here is not without genuine sobs, but I found it all a tad tragic that here is this abandonded boy still trying to win some acceptance from Dad - be it his earthly one or God - and that his method of winning that acceptance is to live on his knees instead of his own two feet. Hopefully Michael's next volume will be when he finds his own voice and his own manhood. 
 Bordewich has written a book that may appear to go againt stereotypes of Native Americans but this is just a thin disguise for the real purpose of the book which is an all-out assault on indian rights. On just about every issue, Bordewich glorifies those Indian peoples who are willing to assimilate to mainstream American culture while portraying those who want to hold on to their own, unique cultures as "fundamentalists" who are hopeless in their devotion to romantic stereotypes. Accusing anyone who is not willing to go along with his obviously conservative political bias of being addicted to stereotypes is Bordewich's way to squash anyone with different political views. His political bias is so strong that in several occasions it affects the quality of his research since he tries at all costs to pigeonhole the facts to fit his thesis. Pretending to be an objective reporter out to debunk stereotypes makes this a very deceptive book. My advice is to stay away and read someone who is more honest about his/her agenda. 
 There more than enough interesting material here for a good book. Reading this is like following a dozen rabbit trails without a guide. Even knowing the point of the essay before-hand only carried me so far. These authors needed more interested editors 
 Lisey's Story is the newest in a series of boring books by Stephen King. Very sad considering Mr. King used to be one of my favorite authors. I hate to say this, but it seems since Mr. King got hit by that van, his writing has gone downhill. Liseys's Story got alot of good reviews and I thought maybe the old, page turning Stephen King was back. Not so. I was lucky to get through about 50 pages of this book and called it quits. I was being put to sleep. 
 This book is an excellent affirmation of Christian values that must be read by anyone who didn't realize that "The Da Vinci Code" was a work of fiction. Please reread that sentence; "The Da Vinci Code" is a work of fiction, like "Star Trek" or "Harry Potter". Unfortunately, the same people who fail to appreciate this fact are the same people who actually need to read "Cracking Da Vinci's Code," in order to restore balance to a worldview so easily upset by Dan Brown's clever yarn.   Unfortunately, this book is poor ammunition for anyone actually hopeing to defend the Christian faith from a popular fascination with the romanticized Cult of the Magdelene presented by Dan Brown. Doctors Garlow and Jones, both highly educated evangelists, have crafted a book that is more or less comfort food for their audience, not any scholarly attempt to address the factual underpinnings of Brown's novel. Somewhat pointedly, Garlow and Jones choose some of the weaker elements of Brown's novel to base their case on.  For instance, by way of dealing with non-Canon gospels (the Gnostic gospels, and the somewhat-less-offensive Apocryphal texts), Garlow and Jones give a selective history of the Council of Nicea which posits that they merely reaffirmed a version of the New Testament already in circulation. This is somewhat true, but ignores how the wording of the gospels were decided to specifically reaffirm the Nicean view of Christianity at the expense of other popular Churches of the time (including churches established by the very disciples of Jesus). They cast aspersions on non-Canon texts without actually addressing why they are or aren't considered reliable. Likewise, when it comes to a discussion of Paganism and its influence on Christian theology, the authors steadfastly refuse to acknowledge even the possiblity (much less the accepted fact) that rituals central to Christianity - such as baptism, the eucharist, and  chrism (annointing with oil or ashe) - were all employed by pagan cults for thousands of years prior to Christianity. Instead, Garlow and Jones rely on the emotional impact of the epithet "pagan" on their reader to cast aspersions and reinforcce doubt.   Most disappointing about this book is that the authors attack fiction with fiction. Where there exist stronger points in the scholarship that underpin Brown's fiction (and I can't emphasize enough that "The Da Vinci Code" is JUST an entertaining story), Garlow and Jones turn instead to a fictional couples experience attending a discussion group of Brown's book and it's central thesis, which naturally involve secularist ridicule of faithful Christians engaged in acts of ministry.   There are even a few instances where the authors manufacture assertions by inferral that were never made by Brown or any of his characters. Half way through this book, I got the distinct impression that neither Garlow or Jones (nor their editor) ever actually read Browns fictional works.  This is one of those rare books where I was relieved to finally have finished it. There is no vice in the spirited defense of ones faith through the presentation of facts in support of rational argument. Unfortunately, this book is very light on facts, and frequently resorts to emotional arguments. The Gospels tell us that Jesus himself debated with authority found in a thorough knowledge of the law, and was skilled in avoiding rhetorical traps. Garlow and Jones do the opposite: they count on the unfamiliarity and uncertainty of the general population, and frequently employ rhetorical traps. Anyone seeking to be Christ-like, and defend their faith, would do well to not rely on this book. 
 I bought this text thinking it would also have the homework problems with answers.  The text contains only answers, and they didn't seem any different from the answers in the Appendix of Stewart's textbook.  I had taken Calc 1 and 2 a few years previously, and had to have the current homework problems.  The chapters and sections didnt exactly coincide with Stewart's text, which was confusing.  
 This product does create white noise but it has a metallic clicking and rattling, rendering the product useless 
 I never read the book, but I hated the movie. The acting was weak, the dialog was elementary and the plot was unremarkable. Let's hope they don't make a sequel. The final straw was the Avril Lavigne song over the end credits 
 This 3 CD set is too limited.  It's more like a scouting party than a full blown invasion.  A better choice would be the 9 volume "The British Invasion: The History of British Rock" from Rhino.  There are 20 cuts on each CD and is way more comprehensive.  If you are simply looking for some of the early British groups this one is marginally passable, but for the best in-depth compilation go for the Rhino set 
 This is almost the Catholic study of Tolkien we've been waiting for.  But not quite.  Though diligently researched, with 800 footnotes, it somehow manages not to engage with its subject very much.  Birzer says occasional odd things like describing "Mythopoeia" as "a poem written to celebrate" Lewis's conversion, surely the wrong word, and claiming that Ilúvatar bypassed the Valar in destroying Númenor.  I found it diffuse and nowhere near as interesting as I'd hoped 
 I'm dissapointed with the book as it does not give us enough information on holistic aspects of Tube Amp building as it contain too much of unnecessary basic information and pictures. I think it's good for an overview for valve amp building theory but not practical 
 This Audio CD was produced in very poor quailty, in terms of the sound and by the person reading it.  It would be nice if it was the true voice of Wallace Wattles - because I'd keep it just for sentimental reasons, but it sounds like it was recorded in about 1970 in a closet with a $50 tape recorder.  The reader is not professional - being short to of breath to speak whole sentences, and they are very monotone without expression (and I love this book so much, I want to hear it with some amount of conviction, strength and joy!)  If you want a better audio version than this - simply record yourself 
 Go and buy some Bobby Darin, Tony Bennet or in fact anyone who can sing. If I had composed some of the great music  on this Cd I wouldn't have given Costello the permission to murder  the songs in the way he does 
 I have loved every Le Creuset product I have purchased with the big exception of the Whistling Teakettle!  I did away with it a couple of months ago and bought the Brittany model to replace it.  The Whistling kettle burned my hand on several occasions, as the design of the spout allowed the hot water to spit and jump right out of the pot!  The whistle is removable and you must put your hand near the spout to remove it for pouring.  Even after waiting a minute after taking the water off the heat, the water would still jump from the spout.  While a little larger than I would have liked, the Brittany does not have the same problem and the whistle can be safely flipped up before pouring.  I have been very pleased with my new kettle and would recommend the Brittany by far over the Whistling 
 Simply, a terribly written book.  It has a shallow plot, flat characters and no style.  His descriptions of people are often late, and tend to consist of someone's skin colour.  And that's all.  The story moves ok at first but degrades into the most uninteresting chase/camping trip in the history of the world.   The ideas presented are soft, touchy feely sort of "the soul is love" type crap.  Seems like it's a rip off of The Celestine Prophecy, which isn't something anyone should want to rip off in the first place 
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 The author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet-related happenings. His intent seems to be to say --  The internet changes _everything_, becomes a social leveller. Youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things, but also new processes, new paradigms, and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so.  He uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by SEC, another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast, yet another writing programs to napsterize everything.  He indicates "flattening" of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations, and has this concept of "insiders" being unseated by "outsiders" due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined, developed and brought to market, thanks to the internet.  There is some truth to his observations, but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend. It is of course true that the internet gives "access" and "freedom" renewed relevance. I like to think of it as "digital democratization" of society.  
 "OF PARADISE AND POWER" - BY ROBERT KAGAN  "Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus" - apart from simply raising a few eyebrows, this line by Robert Kagan author of "Of Paradise And Power", has not only caught the attention of many but managed to stir up a wave of discussions among the politicians and elites concerned with cross-Atlantic relations. Kagan's thought provoking book became extremely popular and received international acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating US-Europe relationship, not to mention its catchy and striking phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book. Kagan introduces multiple chapters in his book, in order to deconstruct the key underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between US and Europe. In the chapter "The Power Gap", Kagan starts from World War I to understand the aversiveness Europe displays towards military and wars. He argues that while both the World Wars weakened Europe tremendously; they helped the US emerge as a super power. He further elaborates on the might of the US in the chapter that follows - "Psychologies of Power and Weakness". Kagan explains how lack of power can not only affect psychologies and ideologies, but change perspectives as well. He claims Europe's paucity of military power compels it to not only tolerate threats but ignore them all together and at the same time try and counterbalance the US force by constructing a world which is governed by economic and soft non-violent methods. This chapter culminates into "Hyperpussiance", a chapter in which Kagan discusses intricate details of Kosovo and Bosnia, highlighting Europe's failure and America's effectiveness in handling the situation. He finally presents his central argument in the chapters "The Post Modern Paradise" and "The World America Made" where Kagan states, "Europe's evolution into its present state occurred under the mantle of the U.S. security guarantee and could not have occurred without it." Casting doubts on Europe's intentions, Kagan centers his argument on the growing self-centered policies of Europe and questions the validity of cohesive terms such as `west' in his chapter "Is It Still `The West'"?  Finally, it seems Kagan provides a solution to this insolvable problem of the US- Europe divide in his concluding chapter, "Adjusting to Hegemony", by simply stating one line - "the task for both Europeans and Americans is to readjust to the new reality of American hegemony". This extremely small book, as compared to the issue it addresses needs further analysis and some close examining. There are many issues to be addressed in Kagan's brief analysis and one might not be completely satisfied with certain claims, reasonings or the manner in which such a grave and sensitive topic is handled. While there is a tone of underlying bias (in contrast to the general opinion of a well-balanced view that the author holds), Kagan manages to miss out some crucial facts and figures, not to mention present stark paradoxes, and the essay lacks sufficient citings.        To start with, let me point out the contradictions in Kagan's arguments, the presence of which highly undermines his claims, leaving the reader in a dilemma unconvinced of either argument. Kagan claims, "Europe's relative weakness has understandably produced a powerful European interest in building a world where military strength and hard power matter less than economic and soft power...rules of behavior" (pg.37). He goes on to say, - "Since Europeans lack the capacity to undertake unilateral military actions, either individually or collectively as `Europe,' it is natural that they should oppose allowing others to do that they cannot do themselves."(pg.38) in contrast to "...Europe today has the wealth and technological capability to make itself more of a world power in military terms if Europe wanted to become that kind of world power" (pg.53-54). Kagan contradicts his own views, stating many times that Europe is militarily weak, nor does it have the capacity to build up its forces yet at the same time, puts forth an argument of Europe's capabilities of increasing its defense spending and military might to match the US.      In the chapter, Psychologies of Power and Weakness, Kagan's one claim contradicts another which is made in the next chapter as the reasoning for both his claims seem to be absolutely tangential. He first explains Europe's greater tolerance for threats is due to its weakness and the fearful past, which it has suffered from. He then metaphorically explains it by giving the example of a man with a knife and the same one with a rifle having different interpretations of the word `threat' when confronting a bear (pg.31). But again Kagan himself feels Europe can become a military power as and when it wishes to, when he says "They could easily spend twice as much as they are currently spending on defense if they believed it necessary to do so" (pg.54). So this forces me to ask a question, would one be mauled by a bear if one could produce a rifle to prevent this misfortune? So isn't it quite possible that Europeans feel safe, not because they "...enjoy the `free ride' they have gotten under the American security umbrella over the past six decades" (pg.54), but rather because there was and is no real threat at all?      With the use of phrases such as "The Axis of Evil" and "Rouge States" (pg.30), which Kagan uses to describe Iraq and Iran, not to mention his references to `Weapons of Mass Destruction' (which he uses as a pretext to the war in Iraq), which still seem to be elusive for some reason, he seems to perplex me by blatantly ignoring his own creation. While Kagan maintains that Iraq was a threat and the US perceived it as one while Europe did not, he might want to explain as to why, in 1997, he (Kagan was the Director of the Project for the New American Century) signed a document which justifies American occupation of the Middle-East, irrespective of threats from Iraq or Iran.  "The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein... From an American perspective, the value of such bases would endure even should Saddam pass from the scene. Over the long term, Iran may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests in the Gulf as Iraq has. And even should U.S.-Iranian relations improve; retaining forward-based forces in the region would still be an essential element in U.S. security strategy given the longstanding American interests in the region."(pg.17 - Rebuilding America's Defenses - *1)  This forces me to conclude that either the author has resorted to `cherry picking' of evidence or he suffers from selective amnesia.     Some of his reasoning, analysis and analogies seem to be too nave. When explaining military action, one cannot justify it by saying, "When you have a hammer, all problems start to look like nails". The author speaks about the nation's (US's) willingness to go to war simply because it has the ability and the capacity to do so. Without discussing a need or providing concrete reasons for the use of aggression, the author seems to be content in justifying use of force, simply because one has it. One important aspect Kagan leaves out in his analysis are the political and economical aspects of the ongoing US-Europe feud. While I have discussed some economical aspects later in the review, one must note that Kagan does not mention the Kyoto Protocol (apart from Clinton's negotiation of it (pg.45)). The US withdrawal from the Protocol had created serious problems and divisions between the two giants (www.climnet.org - *2). While there were many other issues that further fanned the growing fire, disagreements over the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty for example, which Kagan conveniently sweeps under the carpet, needed to be addressed if one is discussing transatlantic relations (www.bbcnews.com - *3, 4)      For a book which covers issues from the pre World War II decade (occasionally going back to ancient philosophy) to the present issues, 72 citations, from which many are simply extended explanations (for examples, see supra notes- 19, 20, 22), seem to be alarmingly low, especially with the absence of some important ones and not to mention, certain citations which wrongly allude to historical facts. Kagan mentions, "As `some' Europeans put it, the real division of labor consisted of the United States making the dinner and the Europeans doing the dishes" (pg.23), yet he does not refer to any source for this cynical statement. He says, "The vast majority of Europeans always believed that the threat (if any) posed by Saddam was more tolerable than the risk of removing him" along with other alleging statements like, "The rehabilitation and reintegration of Saddam Hussein's Iraq is precisely what they(Europe) sought" (pg.44) , and again gives no source for the origin of these beliefs. Strangely, he supports one of his claims by stating in his supra note.20, pg.30, "for that matter, this is also the view commonly found in American textbooks". One might not generally expect to see such puerile purporting evidence in a scholarly analysis of transatlantic relations. Kagan at times jumps back to Athenian times and has injected strong philosophies in his essay. He mentions a number of times how Americans see the world from a Hobbesian perspective while Europeans are followers of Kantinian policies. Kagan seems to have overlooked the fact, that though Hobbes had described the state of nature as that of "all against all", the only reason Hobbes justifies a sovereignty is to ensure peace on earth. Kagan conveniently cites Hobbes (Hobbes theory itself was flawed as later philosophers termed it as `Hobbes Dilemma') to justify American aggression, but no where in Hobbes' theory is aggression justified by the sovereign (Leviathan - Ch.17).       There are some conclusions Kagan draws which seem to be beliefs of an American idealist living in a world where politics is as pure as religion. He concludes that while the US was providing "free security" to Europe after the Cold War, "...America's great power and willingness to assume responsibility for protecting other nations..." (pg.34) has given Europe the opportunity to build up economically. Kagan further asserts his point when he says, "Given America's willingness to spend so much money protecting them, Europeans would rather spend their own money on social welfare programs, long vacations and shorter workweeks" (pg.54). These are inaccurate presentations of facts, which are more of subjective, bias ideologies. I would like to put forth two points in order to accentuate the conspicuous fallacy of these two statements. First, America's interest in Europe was not to provide it with security whether before or after the Cold War. One must not confuse the fact that measures taken to restrict the Soviet advance was purely for selfish motives, rather than for the benefit of nations which were under the watchful eye of the communist empire (Kagan himself acknowledges the fact when he says, "With the check of the Soviet power removed, the United States was free to intervene practically whenever and wherever it chose..."(pg26)). Second, when Kagan acknowledges that Europe which has a "$9 trillion " economy is in a comfortable position to support its welfare programs along with increased military spending; attributing the fact that Europe spends more on welfare, as he calls them "free-riders", results in a faulty analysis.  When I had mentioned earlier that Kagan chose to omit and ignore certain facts, the example of the Balkans, which the author has cited many times in his book would seem most relevant. Kosovo is one of the primary issues he discusses to bring forth US benevolence and European incapacity. "American involvement in Kosovo or Bosnia was not based on calculations of a narrow American `national interest'...While Americans had a compelling moral interest in stopping genocide and ethnic cleansing,... the US had no `national interest' at stake in the Balkans"(pg.50), this is how Kagan sees it. Indeed stopping genocide was a concern, but was it the only concern? While Milosevic had very much agreed to station NATO troops in Kosovo to stop the conflicts, none seem to have been interested in his offer; they rather wanted complete access and control to all of Yugoslavia. The Rambouillet Accord, to which the Contact Group added an Appendix B on the last day of the conference held at Paris, one must note was the primary reason for rejecting NATO troops, as it demanded Yugoslavia to surrender its autonomy and sovereignty. Yet, he does not mention of Milosevic agreeing to station NATO troops in Kosovo (http://wsws.org *5).      Some thing missing from Kagan's entire book are the words "Latin America" and "Africa". As seen above, Kagan believes America was spending its money protecting Europe and Europe alone from all the threats around the world, before and after the Cold War. But what baffles me to quite an extent is that not once does Kagan mention about any American intervention in Latin America (official or not), Africa or the Far East for that matter. Those who are well aware of the world around them, will be aware of America's support for dictators and other corrupt regimes throughout Latin America and the far East, Indonesia for example, which were for self serving purposes alone or is it that the author is implying that the Latin American and African countries were a threat to Europe, hence the interventions and no mention of them? (A complete timeline by Steven Kangas can be found on multiple sites *6, 7, 8)       There is one severe `defect', as I put it, which undermines the entire argument of this book. Kagan's tunneled vision approach, which refers to the word `power' only in terms of military strength and capabilities, ultimately results in a false dichotomy, which is the stumbling stone for his thesis. Kagan believes the world and in particular, Europe, is left with two options, that either they follow the US or be a tacit audience. The reason he reaches this conclusion as I previously put it, is due to his convergent view. "Rather than viewing the US as a Gulliver tied down by Lilliputian threads", says Kagan, "American leaders should realize that they are hardly constrained at all, that Europe is not really capable of constraining the US". He reinforces this claim throughout his book (see pg- 33, 37-40, 59, 62, etc). The author's abysmal ignorance about hard-hitting, highly valid and relevant facts has rendered severe blows to the validity of his claims. Kagan has committed serious errors here, by ignoring Europe's strength, not military but political and economical indeed. With a population of 456,953,258 (the CIA Fact Book *9) and still growing, the EU, leave aside Europe, cannot be simply overlooked or brushed aside as a dead competitor or a bygone culture. Europe is economically strong enough to trouble the US as and when it wants to, the recent problems over the genetically altered meat, banana dispute, steel industry debacle, Airbus-Boeing clash and many more, have all proved that Europe's economic strength is much of a concern for the US.  While I must point out a rank deletion, I believe this is `the' single factor which is capable for arguing against all of Kagan's thesis and arguments, and that is the American Economy. Not once has he mentioned the deteriorating state of American economy (2001), even though problems did exist when he wrote this book. He seems to be blissfully ignorant and persists that America can sustain its exorbitant defense spending, "...the US can sustain its current military spending levels and its current global dominance far into the future". Strangely, the growing inflation rate, rising unemployment, stagflation, trends the economy was showing of heading towards a recession, were I believe dismissed as myths by the author (for statistics see - www.bbcnews.com; http://wsws.org *10, 11). Also, Kagan's final solution suggest that, "The obvious answer is that Europe should.... and build up its military, even if only marginally", leaves me with a conundrum. Is Kagan implicating that Europe has no military at all or is it that he wants to begin a new arms race, this time Cold War II? Kagan must understand he is writing this book for international publics and not simply those, whose ideologies are in tandem with his. Hence, I doubt most would disagree that the world should get into an arms race here, as we all know, there is no stopping to this evil if it once starts.  While I have already discussed the effects of trade and economics (which Kagan ignores) on the US-Europe relation, there is something I must point out before I end this review. Kagan, rather conveniently digresses of the topic, which is transatlantic relationships, to justifying US hegemony in a neo-conservative fashion. While most Americans themselves would probably not agree with Kagan's ideology (as the public opinion and faith plummets - see polls from various news sources *12), leave aside Europeans or rest of the world, Kagan writes almost 15 pages to justify it. This was a rather disappointing conclusion to his book, where he thinks the only solution to the ever widening divide is "Adjusting to Hegemony". When Kagan says how many (statistics seem to abandon him) Americans believe that by advancing their interest, they advance the interest of humanity, he sounds exuberantly jingoistic and to drive the point home, he quotes Benjamin Franklin as saying - "America's cause is the cause of all mankind" and again I must bring to the author's notice, the recipient of these remarks is an international audience, which is diverse, has its own culture and heritage, religious beliefs and ideologies and has no reason to believe why their culture or beliefs are inferior to any other.  An author of his stature must realize that it is transatlantic relationships and not a primary grade bully that is being discussed. While he seems to take pride in saying that America has a "go it alone" attitude (pg.39, 99), it does not abide by the UN Security Council (pg.40, 99), takes action unilaterally irrespective of international laws (pg.45, 61, 99), is justified in adopting `double standards' (pg.62, 99), he fails to fathom the gravity of the current day (or rather the day when he wrote this book) situation and the growing unpopularity of American foreign policy around the world. While he sees Europe as an obstacle in the path of America's imperialistic goals, a neutral observer would be more than justified in pointing out that may be it is the US that hinders progress and efforts of the EU to establish a world which respects international laws, human rights, collective public opinion and most of all - peace. He fails to give an impartial, if not a complete solution to rid the world of this wedge as he weakly concludes his essay by saying, "...a little common understanding can still go a long way". While many have nothing but words of praise, as a one line summary by Francis Fukuyama calls it - "Brilliant" (a co-architect and signatory of the Rebuilding America's Defense Project) and according to Dr. Henry Kissinger, [against whom innumerable charges of human right violations have been levied, who ironically, Kagan terms as a "quintessential realist". See - http://en.wikipedia.org(for cases) *13; http://www.thenation.com(for list of crimes) *14] the book is a "seminal treatise" which would "shape the (US-Europe relation) discussion for years to come"; I do not particularly endorse it it. As I have already put forth immense supportive data to show why the book lacks a concrete argument, sane reasoning or supportive evidence, though its lucid prose, easy comprehension and its articulate linking makes it a good read, it barely digs deep into the problem or the solution, apart from scratching the surface, `the military surface'. Indeed the book did create waves in the political arena, which was probably due to its impeccable timing, but I cast serious doubts on the claims that it would be "discussed for years to come".     *1   - http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf *2   - http://www.climnet.org/news/march2001.html *3   - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1383385.stm *4   - http://212.58.226.30/1/hi/business/2052405.stm *5   - http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/apr1999/yugo-a14.shtml *6   - http://www.atrocities.net/  *7   - home.att.net/~Resurgence/CIAtimeline.html  *8   - www.serendipity.li/cia/cia_time.htm	 *9   - http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ee.html *10 - http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/dec2000/us-d30.shtml *11 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1263211.stm *12 - http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php *13 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger *14 - http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&pid=17 
 I mostly bought this book because I am a fan of the TV show Medium and thought this book might give me an idea of who / what the real person was.  I was hoping also to hear more about the criminal profiling aspect of Alison Dubois' "gift".  Unfortuantely none of the above were achieved.  This book seems to be more about telling it's audience to accept the psychic's in their lives.  I didn't feel it gave me any insight into the afterlife.  Overall I was very disappointed 
 Only mildly accurate, the clumsy mix of true Gaelic forms along with Anglicizations leaves me a bit put off. This might make it useful to many, but it is not at all formal in structure. There are also some names with variations given that are just ridiculously old. Noone uses the root 'dub' in place of 'dubh.' Some truly ancient names are included, but their selections are random. It appears to be mostly gloss from a few limited sources 
 This book is poorly written, disgustingly inappropriate, and crass.  The characters are rude to each other.  It references periods, maxi pads, virgins, groupies... it clearly shows the problems in today's society including lack of respect for each other, lack of dignity, forget grace, that's long gone...  Do anything with your money other than buying this book. 
 What a disappointment.  I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.  But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series.  It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel:  despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.  This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about. 
 This book is not completely without merit, but it's really one of those books that should have been damned with faint praise & allowed to slink off quietly & die.  I feel my primary responsibility here is to debunk Spider's slavish blurb praising this...novel.  And yes, it's supposed to be `funny,' & quite possibly supposed to be bad SF-if so, it's a success on some levels anyway.  Terry Pratchett fans may enjoy it, those of us who enjoy our `funny' novels a little more `funny' may be annoyed.  So:  1)	Heinlein wouldn't have loved it.  For SF published in 2001, the science sucks: a crime is committed, a crime for which no expense is spared in finding the thieves, flakes of skin are left behind at the scene, yet in this far future of space ships & psychic powers (which a few pages before they are introduced are pooh-pooh as bad science fiction), no one apparently is capable of analyzing DNA.  The discussion of radio-isotope dating shows no understanding of either current techniques (which it explains ham handedly), nor how the technology might evolve over thousands of years.  There's lots more. 2)	It's not so much like Heinlein's work that you might think he wrote it.  I have read every good work of Heinlein's (many several or dozens of times), and most of the crap he produced after he lost it.  This doesn't read like good Heinlein or even senile, sex obsessed old Heinlein, not even the page we are given that is `such a good forgery even the experts were still debating its authenticity after 4 years,' bares the slightest resemblance to anything he could or would have written.  It's bad.  It's just plain bad. 3)	Spider Robinson lost my respect a long time ago.  When he started out he was a Canadian hippy with his own voice, who also wrote damn good SF reviews & happened to like Heinlein a lot.  I read all of his reviews for years, and bought many good books based on them, I also bought his first several novels, which verged on brilliant, and possessed many of the qualities he assigns this minor piece of trash.  But then RAH got sick, and people started rightly questioning particularly the sexism of some of his works (and taking nothing away from his literary accomplishments, which are impressive) & then he died.  At this point, for reasons only Spider can say, Spider lost it.  He wrote diatribes defending Heinlein that while providing much good evidence in Heinlein's favor, made the serious mistake of ignoring the mounds of evidence that also supported his opponent's positions.  Additionally, & much more damningly, his own work changed over the course of a novel or a novel and a half into a third rate pastiche of Heinlein that magnified his faults, and left almost everything that does give RAH resonance & poetry & power far behind.  I stopped reading him, and his opinion stopped matching anything that fit into my reality. 4)	Lastly, though I'm sure both Robinson & Janifer will deny any malfeasance, the fact that both Spider's name & the name of his most famous character occur on the first page of the novel, strikes me as quid pro quo of the most bald faced kind.  This is not a horrible novel.  It's vaguely funny.  It's mildly interesting.  But it's no Robert Heinlein, nor is it funny as, say, Douglas Adams.  But it's not horrible. 
 Had the printer for just over a year with light use.  I started getting numerous error messages, then the printer would stop printing in the middle of a page or I couldn't get it to print at all.  Spent over two hours in a hp chat session that made little sense - (was told to push buttons my printer doesn't have, and when I told the rep that nothing happened after a procedure to re-set the printer, she replied "great, that means it worked.")  Was then offered the option of getting the printer serviced for $290, the same price I paid for it a year ago, or upgrading to a C6180 for $300, which is $20 more than the current price on Amazon.  This product has been a waste of time, money and energy 
 This Joe d'Amato film takes the Women in Prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze, bordering on pornography. The plot, or lack thereof, is typical: woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards  corruption. To make the film last 80 minutes, Joe d'Amato fills the story  with lesbianism, vile tortures, naked women in rat infested sewers, and  plenty of gratuitous sex. I gave this movie 1 star because there is no  option for a 0 star rating. Even hardcore fans of Euro sex queen Laura  Gemser will find this one a total bore 
 Let's look at the Target Audience and why they will not buy this book. I am an unbeliever, or better yet an Apostate. When I read what this book was about, I laughed. It is obvious that what he is doing is highly speculative and forbidden within a Calvinist framework. 'The *secret* things belong to the Lord." As has been said, Superstring theory is not even a proven concept yet, like Evolution is. Even if it was, it would be dangerous for bible believing Christians to define the Trinity, the Incarnation, or other *anomilies* (contradictions) within the framework of Superstring Theory. What would be the connection? There is no way you can take the ancient *formulas* that attempt to make sense of the above doctrine of God and *make them fit* into a *naturalistic* explanation for God. If Superstrings can be proven, then they fall into the natural realm of the Universe. If you can *contain* God in a well defined dimension, then you have a naturalistic, and thus limited God. He would be no longer Omnipresent, Omnipotent and all those other things you like to ascribe to him.  Though I appreciate the attempt to make sense out of God through science, this approach has obvious pitfalls. Perhaps someone can state the case better then I can, since I honestly do not understand superstring theory, but I do understand that if we can find other diminsions in our universe, they would have a naturalistic character to them, and then by definition, God would be *contained*.  Bottom line, what he is saying is wishful saying and unscriptural. The bible doesn't even hint at fanciful scientific theories. The bible isn't a science textbook.  In fact, the bible cannot answer simple questions like if God said, be fruitful and multiply to all the creatures he created on that first week that more then 90% of all species are already extinct. I guess they didn't obey him??? 
 This woman is no biblical scholar. She does not need to worry. I am sure she will never be mistaken for a Proverbs 31 woman.  Egalitarians make a case that the man is not over the woman in the home--that was a result of the fall. Yet, we wear clothing as a result of the fall; yes, we are under the New Covenant through Jesus, but we still wear clothing. We sin as a result of the fall; under the New Covenant we still sin. Women have pain in childbirth as a result of the fall; women still have pain in childbirth, today, under the New Covenant. Yes, the man is the head over the woman in the home as a result of the fall, and he is STILL the ordained covering, leader, and head over the woman and the home under the New Covenant.  One thing these women such as this author conveniently dismiss is that women will want to rule over men as a result of the fall.  At least this book was worth reading for me (and worthy of one star), because it reinforced my traditional beliefs and made me want to have nothing to do with the egotistical spirit at work in the feminist movement of pride, and power and control. 
 Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization.  
 I bought this album thinking that it would be good...boy was I wrong! Ms. McBride did not do these songs justice by the way she sang them. Rose Garden, for example is my favorite song, and is sung by Lynn Anderson...it was the most beautiful song ever and you could almost feel the Rose Garden as Lynn was singing. Marting sang the song like it was a meaningless song...no feeling, emotions, etc. The rest of the songs sounded crummy too. Save your money and buy the orginal artist who sang the songs. 
 I was really looking forward to this book. I'm not sure when I have been so disappointed in a story after all of the hype.  I was raised in mid-west and expected a serious story about trials of a disfunctional family. What a total waste of time. Turd fantasy is not my idea of great literature. Worst book I have read since "Running with Scissors".  I don't need to waste my time on this psychotic drivel parading as great art 
 I had to read this book for a Multicultural Literature class at my Uni, and, far from being informative, all it did was fill with me a contempt of my own. I am not a racist by any means, but when confronted with such a bitter, snide voice as the one Kincaid displays, I find myself unconsciously getting defensive. When she says, "you are a tourist; you are ugly," I find myself saying, "Fine, I'll keep my money and let you trade with seashells and beads." Kincaid is a master of the self-fulfilling prophecy: she says Antiguans are so oppressed and so downtrodden and so angry, and rather than doing anything to help it, she's exacerbating it by using such a bitter, over-the-top voice.   Other reviewers have stated that the vision of Antigua portrayed is a warped and extremely limited one, biased by Kincaid's apparent small mindedness, and I must confess that I'm glad to hear that. To think that the entire island is solely occupied by bitter people who imagine themselves to be ex-slaves would make me steer clear of the area any time I go on vacation.   Because, yes, I am a tourist. And no, being a tourist does not automatically make anyone ugly, despite what Kincaid's bitter rant might say. 
 This magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature, stupid, and boring.  The magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so-called news coverage gives short details of events and people that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste.  Don't bother 
 This book was not quite up to my expectations.  It was interesting but I felt the writer wasn't being totally honest about his rate of recovery since it conflicted heavily with his wife's view.  I actually liked his wifes diaries, they were very helpful in what the actual recovery process was.  I wouldn't highly recommend paying the money for this book 
 I would call this the musical equivalent of the worst of abstract art.  There are those that "appreciate" unintelligable works for fear of being thought stupid if they don't . . . just as the emporer's subjects "Ooh"ed and "Ah"ed in admiration of his clothing as he paraded naked in front of them 
 The title of this film is very deceiving & it's pretty clear that it was designed to lure people in.  I actually saw this movie way back in the early 90s.  I forgot all about it and got excited and bought it a few years back.  I thought it was a sure-fire to be wall-to-wall skin.  After all, it features 2 names (Dana Delany and Kim Cattral) who have shown no aversion to shedding their clothes in other movies.  Well, I was way wrong.   There is MAYBE 10 seconds worth of nudity in the whole movie.   It's also supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find it particularly humorous, either.  For what it is, it's an OK movie.   It details what is basically a slumber party for a group of grown women.   Some of the dialogue about sex is cool - kind of like finding out what goes on in a women's locker room.  There's also some exploration of how being a lesbian might make life more "simple" than being straight.  However, in the end, I found this to be a pretty dull film.   Most importantly, it does not deliver on what the title promises.  I would be far more forgiving if they had named this movie something else, but I do detest false-advertising 
 My girlfriend bought me this so called...book...not worth the cash. If I had seen it in the store, I would just have gone to the office supply aisleand bought a three ring binder for 99 cents and made it myself. But his other real books are good 
 Anil is plastic - if she has any sensitivity or cultural ties to her birth country, they are hidden.  As someone born & raised in Sri Lanka, I felt the situation could have been explained MORE for the rest of the world.  And SUDDENLY this plastic Anil, who has shown no feelings, no emotion (not even surprise) stands up in front of military men and a panel claiming "YOU are killing us!" - us?  And where does this emotion come from.  No-one is even sure WHY Sailor is dead - was it accidental and meant for another, was he killed by JVP for refusing to go on strike?  Why was a gem-miner killed by the death squads? - nothing was explained.  Even the ending - did Sarath & Gamini just die - was it a dream?  Was it all just a sea bath in the Indian Ocean at Mt. Lavinia?   
 This is a classic example of a writer letting the constructs of academic verbage get in the way of his message.  Altman has some solid original ideas about the history and construction of American screen musicals, but  he lets the language get in the way.  He also gets too many little facts  wrong -- for example, he refers several times to Shirley Jones having a  little sister Amarylis in THE MUSIC MAN, but Amarylis was only her piano  student and NOT a relative! Its hard to respect someone who is so sloppy  about research 
 It seems that everyone says you just have to read this book, and it really probably is going to be a part of my library, but I'm not going to be re-reading it and referring to it again and again, and it didn't have any information the really impacted me - the Comedy Bible and the Comedy toolbox have been much more helpful to me.  What I didn't like about this book is his attitude - he is very condescending in general - and he just makes statements and doesn't back anything up - it's more like an outline than a book. "It's like he was trying to come up with a book and wrote out an outline and didn't do the work to fill in the spaces, no really,    ok - there might be a few lines that define one of his terms, but there aren't any examples, there's no organization, no index, it doesn't show me how to use that as part of my routine, it doesn't help me get organized, it's a terribly disorganized mess, and it doesn't really help me understand what to do and what not to do. It's like he wanted to make money on a book, but he didn't want to have to divulge any of his secrets, so it's like empty.   Yall are not going to like this, but I found it insulting.  But I did read it, and I am glad i got the book, but it wasn't HELPFUL to me - does that makes sense?  I am glad to have this as part of my library,  I think it has some good  ideas that it STARTS to talk about, but it only gives a few lines for each idea, which isn't enough to get all exited about.  I feel like this book has been so strongly marketed that I am supposed to like it, and each time i try to read this book, and I don't finish, each time, I come away feeling a bitter taste in my mouth, and I don't like his attitude, I think he just preaches at you and he's just not really very nice .  That's just my impression.  sorr 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 I recently purchased the electronic format hoping I could free up some shelf space because I already own the hardback.  What a disappointment.  I expected links in the Table of Contents but there wasn't even a Table of Contents.    I'd return this if I could.  If it was print, I would.  Two stars only because I liked the print book 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series.  This is the most boring one of them all in my opinion, and, well, how many times can the same story be told?  Bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children, children figure it out, but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything, even when it's pointed out to them.  6,000 times.   
 As others have mentioned, this starts out innocently with the usual dietary tidbits... then hits you between the eyes with the recommended 15 colonics in the first month; and oh, don't forget to travel abroad somewhere to get the hormone that is illegal to buy in the U.S. and have that injected.  Absolute rubbish, and the first book I have ever returned to Amazon 
 I couldn't believe that this was a real story with real people acting in real ways for a moment. The acting, writing, and directing were as hokey as hokey gets. To hear John Wayne utter his lines is to watch the most one dimensional performance ever, and his characterization is a characature of a tough-guy, bravadolike cowboy. It was like watching Saturday Night Live. The other characitures were equally bad, playing on the most superficial level.   The story is nothing more than a hodgepodge of western cliches, and no amount of desert sunsets and boulders can rescue this unbelievable, laughable film from the world of make-believe! I couldn't wait until the film ended because for me it was an ongoing ordeal. Also, It was way too long, with lots of unnecessary subplots--just useless padding!   Unless you like comic book charicatures--without depth or believability--and cornball dialogue (that you've heard in a million other westerns), don't waste your money on this. Better go with High Noon or Shane, which have believable characters, a courageous hero, a suspenseful story, credible dialogue and are not longer than they should be 
 and also, doen't have radio FM ... I don't recomend 
 Aircraft design from a Cranfield University perspective ONLY. Siginificant aircraft and designs are not discussed. Don't waste your money.  Better books: Fundamentals of Aircraft Design by Leland Nicolai, Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach by Daniel P. Raymer or, for a multi-volume approach, try Aircraft Design by Jan Roskam 
 Basically what Picknett and Prince (believers in the Priory of Sion) have tried to do is to absorb all the damning negative evidence about Pierre Plantard and try to come up with all kinds of various excuses to try to make the subject matter sound serious. But their attempt contains significant omissions, sloppy treatment of the facts and hilarious unjustifiable assumptions that only specialists in the subject matter are able to spot - this is just another howler of a book from them. All interest in the Priory of Sion in France was terminated during the mid-1980s because by that time it was generally realised in that country that the whole thing was a Fake (and the books by Baigent, Lincoln and Leigh were never taken seriously in France either). The authors never bothered to contact authorities like Jean-Luc Chaumeil, who can easily prove by providing primary source evidence that the whole thing was a fake from beginning to end. You do not have to be a hyper-sceptic to know that this whole subject matter is fake but you need to be hyper-gullible to take the Priory of Sion seriously.  
 This book actually annoyed me.  The author finds herself moving in on a seemingly charming Frenchman and then complains about what her life is like with him.  I still don't understand what the couple were doing together in the first place.  It doesn't feel like there's any love between them....it seems that this was the opportune moment for her to try out what it would be like to live in Paris.  I don't really see what it she brings to the table.....she's demanding, is not earning a living and does nothing to make their life together more pleasant....she just complains.  She convinces him to move from a very comfortable (but boring) apt to a much better situated and much more expensive one.  I don't hear that she helps him pay for this in any way....just expects it.    That certainly has not been the way my life has been and if it had been I don't thing I'd be complaining.  It just rubbed me the wrong way.    She seems spoiled and he seems to play into it. I thiink he is far too patient with her. There were not enough cute and funny stories that could have been a part of this story.  
 judging by the clips offered from amazon, this cd sounded like it could be as good as gba material, but i was dissapointed after the first spin, and i haven't put it back in since. It's not bad stuff, just that the jams are  lacking in creativity, and the true funk feel is missing. Try Greyboy  allstars(who are the BEST live), or try the next level in jambads: PHISH 
 This book has a bunch of interviews, so I would normally expect it to be okay.  But it isn't.  There are twenty-one chapters, and we see interviews with people such as Peter Arnett, Chris Hedges, Juan Cole, and many others.  Still, I'd like to focus on the interview with James Bamford, and the praise given for him.  Bamford gets 48 pages, and that's not good.  And I don't see any reasonable people balancing what he says in this book.  Bamford has written outrageously afactual and illogical nonsense about the USS Liberty.  So it is no surprise that when in this book, Bamford is asked whether Israel is a touchy subject, he says that it is enormously so.  And he complains that "you can't talk about Israel in the press without somebody going crazy."  Of course, given what he says about Israel, I'm not surprised.  And Bamford himself seems to be one of those who are going crazy.  When Bamford gets asked if the reason for all the sensitivity about Israel is that Israel is protecting our interests, he replies "What interests?  They're the cause of all the problems."  That comment is, of course garbage.  It is like someone with a fever calling a thermometer the cause of all the problems.  Israel is a small nation that is under attack.  It's not the cause of all the problems in the Middle East.  And since it is not a cause of major problems there, pressuring Israel or destroying Israel will not solve anything.  A book that can be so misleading about this topic is tough to trust on anything.  I don't recommend it 
 I bought this book for my fiance hoping he could have a little fun with it. We've decided to return it pretty quickly -- while it starts our funny enough -- it quickly denegrates into non-funny jokes that indicate that there is NOTHING positive about getting married at all (meeting her parents -- no matter what her mother does means she's coming on the the groom). I expected a book of humor with some practical advice on how to get through it -- I found some humor, but nothing worth keeping.  
 not worth the money.  short, skeletal format with very little new information.  much better off buying the marc cosentino book on case studies.  its far, far better.  this book lacks numbers and solutions to the type of case studies youll be asked and is basically useless.  
 I was originally looking forward to the new ideas to promote myself when I purchased this book but many of these ideas have nothing to do with promotion so this book could have served a better service had it only had 100 ideas and gave a little more detail into each 
 My god.  How can people to write these reviews.  This book is horrible.  The best thing is that she calls on God.  As for skill, the writing is terrible and there are spelling errors throughout the book.  The characters are unbelievable.  The dialogue gives a low class feel to these supposedly upscale characters.  Save your $4 
 After making a strong case that Boxers need specialized training, there seems to be little in it  particular to the Boxer.  I wonder if this is just an edit off one of the other Barron's books.  Two, the author pushes treats as training rewards, which many believe isnt the best.  Three, on some topics, like handling aggression, the author just punts - 'consult an expert.'  Not very helpful.  All in all, I prefer the Monks of New Skeet, and "The Art of Raising a Puppy. 
 So this is what the onetime flagship of the east coast has to offer us. a bunch of remix's with washed up rappers(Craig Mack comes to mind). Hip hop turned pop. BIG gotta be spinnin in his f***in' grave. Knowing he use to roll with this sellout b**ch puffy. Jackin' beats, spittin other ni**as verses, rappin about his wealth. Everything about this ni**a is wrong. He's not even talented, just ridin a dead rapper's street cred. F*** badboy for life 
 I thought that this book was very hard for me to understand. I find that it was just the authors thoughtsabout waht she had read. I found that if I could have gotten past the understanding of the book then I would have enjoyed it much better. I think that I did not like it because I felt as if I was rereading all that time what I had already read. It would be a good book for someone that is into statistics. But however it was very hard for me to comprehend 
 I finished this book, but only so I could move on to another. While I like the author's prose, I found the story line to be a bit far fetched, and predictable. There's better fiction out there. 
 This is a serious book on psychology,  not one of those "how to" popular books. To me it was very helpful, it helps to understand oneself better. I reccomend it warmly 
 24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.   My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.   Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into. 
 Back in the day (1970's) these were made with a stiff, strong PLASTIC, rigid "insert" w/ the poly-rope outside. This gave the "leash" a realistic, "tight but curved under own weight" appearance, & a believable / realistic "bounce" to the "dog" with the most imperceptible wrist action on the part of the "dog walker". HOWEVER, THIS PIECE OF CRAP has a thick soft wire inside the leash, and this gives the leash a very phony, fake-looking, too-heavy, all bent-up look. PIECE OF JUNK PIECE OF JUNK PIECE OF JUNK ! 
 Honestly, I didn't finish this book.  I didn't even get very far.  It sounds wonderful, a book about some of the greatest Christian minds.  It reads like a 4th-graders research paper.  Muggeridge inserts so much of his own thoughts and experiences its almost like we're reading his biography.  His bios of these brilliant men are muddled, not described chronologically or in any other apparent order.  If you want a VERY basic overview of these men, maybe this book is for you.  If you actually have the intelligence to read anything written by any of them - this book is far beneath you 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 First of all, I've read reviews saying that yugioh is out of style. Well, I disagree. There are still people out there who still play yugioh, and buy 5pack boosters like these. This could be the best deal from amazon; to get 5 dark crisis packs for only $20. Personally, I don't think anyone should have to quit yugioh just because someone told he or she that its out of style.  
 I bought this to avoid buing and expensive mandoline to make my sweet potato fries.  What I leared is... the sweet potatoes are too hard for this cutter to work well.  Neither my husband or I could get the sweet potato to cut.  We had to take it out and chop them by hand.  It works very good on regular and smaller potatoes though 
 A waste of money!!  The book refers to Dr. Atkins book all the time.  I should have bought Dr. Atkins book.  How can this book be low carb when the ingredients call for butter, or heavy cream.  Did she forget about all the fat in all her recipes 
 After the hype on this book, I was extremely disappointed at how it rambled along with extraneous detail that never made a cohesive whole. I kept at it, hoping it would improve but alas, dear reader it does not. 
 this movie is one of the 3 ~worst~ movies I've ever seen. these 98 minutes seemed more like 6 hours.  and for chrissake - he's NOT an american 
 John Mayer can grow his hair long and play his guitar slung low, but he is still a professionaly trained monkey, I mean musician. Mayer along with "artists" like Gavin DeGraw, Teddy Geiger, etc., are todays N'Sync and Backstreet Boys, nothing more.  
 Mr. Galbraith is smart, accomplished, and learned man who knows what is best for all us.  His view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia.  Rather than a completely coercive state directing the  actions of its citizens to some hirer calling, Mr. Galbraith aims to be  `practical' and just further defines the third way.  Nonetheless, his  proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and  it is more attuned to the European model of society.  Many of his proposals  are so silly you won't take them seriously.  But sadly, he is quite  serious.  For example, Mr. Galbraith states that in a good society everyone  should have a rewarding life.  Of course, he never defines the standard by  which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding.  Neither  does he address what one should do if their life is un-rewarding and what  the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life.   And, of course, who is the `rewarding life judge' and does this judge have  the authority of the state to take something from someone (who has a life  that is deemed too rewarding) for someone who has life that is too  un-rewarding.  Mr. Galbraith fails to convince the reader of the  practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between  socialism and capitalism, and saying nothing new 
 I'm afraid that the reviewers who didn't like this movie understood it all too well.  At times it promises real drama and tension, but never delivers.  There are too many character twists with no basis.  And the ending really does make the viewer feel cheated.  This is a really poor attempt at making a movie 
 michael moore is a lying jealous hypocrite riding around in limos,owning stock in companies he despises and collecting accolades he doesn't deserve. I think he should move to Iran or Saudi Arabia so he can wear a robe over his "working class"uniform he seems to fool so many people with 
 I bought this book in a sleep-deprived haze when my baby was waking every two hours during the night.  Instead of offering advice, strategies, or even sympathy, I was told that this sleep-deprivation is "nightime parenting" and that I should enjoy my baby while he is small and needy.  The attachment parenting spin on this book is so strong that it is virtually useless to anyone who does not follow this philosophy. I sent this book off to Goodwill.  I much prefer the book by Mark Weisbluth, Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child.  Weisbluth explains baby sleep, at what ages certain naps develop, and most importantly, lays out various strategies for getting your child to sleep better.  
 Pro: easy to visualize the numbers on the screen. Cons:The biggest negaTIVE draw back is that the keys are not very sensitive. You have to push very hard and often multiple times to get a response. This is very frustrating- the help keys does not help at all. Do not buy it ,IT IS A WASTING MONEY 
 I have been studying the development of reason in Western civilization for more than a decade, but I consider myself a decided amateur in this matter. I eagerly seized upon this book the instant I learned of it. I knew that the Church made many important contributions to the development of Western rationalism and I was excited to obtain a detailed explication of those contributions.  What a shock it was to read this shoddy, illogical, work! The author spends his time grinding axes, not exploring ideas. He is out to disprove almost all of modern Western historical scholarship, and so he takes potshots at just about every Enlightenment author he can, and most twentieth century historians as well. I enjoy an author with a controversial case to make, but not when I am subjected to polemics rather than logic.  This book teems with distortions, misleading statements, wild unsupported claims, and outright falsehoods. I gave up attaching annotated yellow stickies after page 50 -- there were too many errors!  The most serious intellectual sin here is Stark's fast and loose definition of the term "Dark Ages". He uses it loosely to describe the period between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Renaissance -- roughly 500 AD to 1450 AD. That's not the way I have seen the term used. Most historians use "Dark Ages to refer to the time from 500 AD to about 1000 AD. The period from 1000 AD to 1450 AD is usually referred to as "The Middle Ages". By using this term fluidly, Stark is able to create all manner of misleading impressions.  For example, he devotes a number of pages to reciting the litany of European technological achievements during the "Dark Ages". What he doesn't say is that almost all of those achievements occurred AFTER 1000 AD, and many arose in the century before the Renaissance. Stark wants to prove that Christianity was responsible for all that technology -- but if so, why did 800 years elapse (from Constantine to 1100 AD) before all those benefits of Christianity appeared?  His errors of fact kept my eyes opening wider and wider. On page 45, he attributes the inventions of the stirrup and heavy cavalry to the Franks, but we have plenty of evidence of the use of the stirrup before the Franks, and the evidence suggests that it appeared in the Eurasian steppes much earlier. And what about the Byzantine cataphracts?  Although I didn't find any bloopers on page 46, there is one startling error on page 47. Referring to the compass, Stark claims that "the Chinese may not, in fact, have used this device aboard ships until long after Europeans were doing so." But in fact, the first mention of the use of a compass in navigation is Chinese and dates from 1117 AD; the first European mention of the use of a compass in navigation dates from 1190 AD.  Here's another howler, from page 48: "...aside from bringing grain to feed the city of Rome's swollen and idle population, long-distance Roman trade mainly dealt in luxuries and was unproductive -- trade played little role in the life of Roman cities." If trade was so insignificant, why did the Romans maintain a navy even after conquering the Mediterranean littoral? The historians that Stark treats with contempt explain that the Romans needed to keep piracy at bay. But if trade wasn't important economically, why bother keeping a navy afloat? And what about those thousands and thousands of amphorae that have been found in Roman shipwrecks all over the Mediterranean? The no-goodnik historians that Stark condemns tells us that they carried wine and olive oil in huge quantities. But since, according to Stark, Roman trade dealt only with luxury goods, then wine and olive-oil must have been luxury goods, right? Except for the fact that they played a large part in the diet of the average classical citizen. Even Jesus drank wine -- was he one of the super-rich too?  Stark tells us on page 49 that Roman "carts and wagons were so primitive that seldom was anything of any weight carried far overland." Perhaps Stark should visit Rome and look at the Coliseum -- its stones didn't come from the immediate neighborhood and there are thousands and thousands of tons of them. In fact, all of Europe is dotted with huge Roman ruins built from heavy stonework that had to be carried from somewhere. And if Stark had ever bothered to read Caesar's Gallic Wars, he'd read lots of mentions of the wagon trains that always accompanied every Roman army.   On page 51, Stark reveals the surprising fact that the violin (among other instruments) was perfected in the Dark Ages. That's just flat wrong. It first appeared in Italy in the 1500s -- long after the Dark Ages ended, even by Stark's own expansive definition.  These are just a few of the gross blunders I found in just a few pages of the book. There are many, many more -- I chose these to demonstrate how densely packed the errors are.   The sad thing about this book is that Stark did not have to lie and distort the truth to make his basic point. The Church played a major and positive role in the development of Western Civilization. It embraced the best parts of classical civilization, improved upon them, and transmitted them to modernity. Once rationalism took hold, things got out of hand (from the Church's point of view) and the Church found itself on the wrong side of the advance of rationalism. Stark goes too far, and in the process succeeds only in discrediting himself. He ascribes freedom, individualism, democracy, science, technology, and capitalism to Christianity, yet not ONE of these concepts is promulgated in the Bible. Every single one of these concepts does appear in classical Greek civilization. Christianity did not create any of these ideas; it embraced them. Christianity deserves great respect for the manner in which it salvaged what was best of classical civilization and preserved and promulgated it. But Christianity was not perfect, nor was it the savior of all mankind. We can give it its due without engaging in cheap hagiography and gross distortions and lies 
 My five and three year old daughters fought over this is the store, but the three year old won and we placed it in her room as a night-light.  The thing is so loud that she asked for her music to be turned up so she could hear it above the lamp.  Needless to say, the lamp is only for decoration now - no one could actually sleep with it on. 
 Watching "Toys" was like watching "Teletubbies" dumbed down for an audience of subhumans.  Six Million Jews died in concentration camps during World War II.  It took the combined forces of the free world to stop this genocide.  Williams and the production company that made "Toys" are just closet nazis.  Inasmuch as I watched this self-righteous piece of elitist garbage, I can say without any hestiation that if you believe that whole nations would be better off in the hands of two-bit despots, then maybe you'll be stupid enough to accept the premise of this unadulterated nonsense.    Pray for peace, but never give in to evil 
 I admit first off that I did not read this entire book - I flipped it open to a page at random in the bookstore today, and the first thing I read was instructions on how a girl could give a boy a B*ow J*b.    If that's what you want for your daughter, knock yourself out, but it sure won't be bought by my family 
 WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CD, WAS TO ME NOTHING LIKE THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE. I LOOKED SO FOWARD TO GETTING IT BECAUSE OF LOVING THE MOVIE SO MUCH. THIS CD SOUND TRACK SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS AN AFTER THOUGHT  AFTER THE MOVIE WAS MADE.   NOW IM STUCK WITH IT 
 Well intentioned, and a good overview.... for 1999.  The web and the world have changed substantially since the book was published 
 The "It's the 2000's and everything is going to be great because nothing can go wrong" theme was the opposite of what I was looking for.   I'm interested in books that give solid detailed steps to take when preparing for your financial future and this book seems to have a "don't worry about it" kind of tone. I found it pretty worthless.  As if he just wrote a book that told people what they wanted to hear in order to get them to by the book.  (... 
 Attempts to read book (3) Review written in style of B. Jones, as book was also.  Tried to read (not v.g.) book, but first had trouble getting beyond "Bridget" style (not v.g.) Read the four "rave" (v.g.) reviews here on Amazon.  Tried twice more to read again.  Humph.  Still, something bothering about (not v.g.) book.  Seemed little more than simply dissection of Helen Fielding's (v.) successful (hurrah) book.   Finally (hurrah) realized problem: to read (not v.g.) book is to read author's dissertation, which am now convinced "book" is, as (humph) so clearly follows standard "How To Write Your Dissertation" guide-- Preparing the Proposal, Conducting the Research, Writing the Research Paper, Sharing the Research Outcomes with Others...all the way to whole qualitative preliminary study combined with quantitative main study for combined methodology.   Obviously, how-to "formulate important and relevant research question" was something along lines of "popularity of chick-lit from Bridget Jones to present day, and how effects 20-something women seeking poise and confidence" as related to spirituality or some such nonsense. Humph.   End result? Author finished up with her PhD by converting dissertation paper into book highlighting research, as PhD candidates do. (Not. v.g.)    At least not another paper on "Women in 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Bridget Jones's Diary.'"  Might impress 20-somethings, but in  opinion, not a v.g dissertation... er...book.   (the added v.g. and hurrahs and whatnot are as tiresome in book as are in review-humph! 
 I cannot believe they WILL NOT change the price.  2 single packs are cheaper than 1 double pack.  I HAVE TOLD THEM several times that www.staples.com has it for $60.99 and www.officemax.com has it for $59.99 and with a $50.00 order-free shipping too. When they can meet or beat this price, I'll buy from them-amazon.com.  If I run out before, I'll go elsewhere. 
 I agree with those that say this book would be more useful if it came with solutions.  Right off in the first chapter, hypothetical situations are presented without any background information in the text.  If you haven't had some experience in Accounting, you are going to be left scratching your head.  The instructor in my class says that it causes you to think.  Hard to think if you have never come close to experiencing anything that is being discussed.  Some guidance would be helpful 
 This is not one of the better books I have read on history that predates mankind.  Before reading the book I knew that women were the first farmers.  The author uses this fact as the basis for thousands of years of discrimination against women.  I do not buy the argument 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 By now its easy to think that perhaps Pete Townsend should change the line in My Generation from "hope i die before i  get old " to simply "wont stop till we all drop (dead)". Since the band seems to have toured more since their early 80's farewell tour then they ever did during the height of the original line up from 1966-1978.  Just as it would be understandable if some 15 year old Greenday fan see one old guy singing very horsed and another old guy with most of his hair missing and maybe swinging his arm in a circle like he was trying to fly away, and wonder what the big deal is. Now granted Im no baby boomer myself, in fact Keith Moon died just one year after I was born  but I can say I have spent the last 12 years now "getting in tune" so to say with the music of trully one of the greatest rock bands ever The Who, and I can say one album had to stand out as being the reason why they are still held in such high regard,  Who's Next would be it.  After the success of Tommy alot of people wonderedwhat direction the who was going in next,  they had already started out as a lil hard edged RnB band and quickly spent another 2 years giving the beatles and the stones a run in the great singles contest.  But Tommy proved once and for all that  Pete Townsend wasnt just a great songwriter/guitar player but that he was also the one guy who saw greater heights for rock then just good way to score with the ladies and in Daltry, Entwistle and Moon had the right bandmates to carry it off with.  The album starts off with Baba O'Riley and from the moment those synthesiser come in you know that both the who as well as rock music are going in a brand new direction, by now this song has surely been played to death on classic rock radio but go back to the music coming out in 1971,  nothing else sounded like this , townsend sounds more like he is trying the instrument like another guitar then like a regular keyboard,  the only other person at the time who could come close to this at the time was stevie wonder, but even his music was still rooted in the funk/soul/church tradition,,  for a very "vanilla" rock group to do this at the time at to seem as normal as man walking on the moon for the first time.  Next up is Bargain and it sounds like here pete is reling even more on the sythesiser as if to prove that this wasnt just some one trick novalty for him and that he was serious bout expanding the sound of rock. Bargain is also the first true Keith Moon dominated sound and with producer Glyn Jones, for the first time keith's drumming sounds as powerful and in ur face as anything john bonham could do for zepplin, listen to all the other who albums and then go back who's next and tell me this isnt the best album keith would do as the who's drummer. Even though John Entwistle was one of the best bass players to come along, its really his songwriting that gets to shine here,  between keith's drumming and pete's guitar and keyboard work, its easy to miss some of the bass notes in the mix so its on John's My Wife where he gets to shine. for the most part Who's next is a very spritual album all bout the quest for some sort of salvation, john bring the whole thing down to earth in the story of a man who is just seeking survival from his spouse once she finds out he has been out all night . but its Roger who gets to shine on the last two cuts , Behind Blue Eyes and Wont Get Fooled Again are two other songs that have been played into a coma thanks to radio and yet one reason why they can still sound fresh is the conviction in roger's voice whether its the voice of yearning to be understood  in the former or a declaration of intent in the latter its roger's voice that comes off like the eye in the center of the storm of the 3 musicians and of course that final scream he gives at the end of Wont Get Fooled would set the standard for countless, shirtless, bare chested blond frontmen everywhere, but the truth is there can only be one master shouter and after him no one is next.. On this deluxe edition u get the who in concert , in their prime perfoming the songs on here at the young vic theater and its easy to see that they had no trouble accomdating pete's new sound to their on stage machine and it help keep them from just being known as the band that tore apart their instruments on stage. and considering who the band would sound in later years with keith's excesses affecting his playing and later a cast of thousands it seemed trying to help fill in the groups sound after he died, and finally seeing the who try to carry on with just pete and roger as the surviving members,  the live disk also is another reminder that in the early 70's when the who were at their peak, trully who else really could be any greater?  BUY THE DAMM RECORD!! 
 After enjoying Blindness and All The Names i really looked forward for what was supposed to be the final masterpeice of a wonderful trilogy. But it seems Mr. Saramago rushed this one, the symbolism is much too obvious, the whole message of the book is clear from the beginning. After the first 40 or so pages you pretty much know what will happen and why, and what it all means and symbolizes. All this, in addition to the fact that it is unbearably boring (edit edit edit, as another reviewer wrote); the author was apparently too lazy to reread what he wrote or to revise anything, he just wrote and wrote and wrote. Too many long boring passages, tedious details and semi-philosophical monologues that go nowhere and add nothing. The whole thing feels like it was forced out of the author to satisfy the demands of his publishers and readers on time. I stopped reading somewhere in the middle of it, it's hard to enjoy a book when you feel that the author himself didn't enjoy writing it.   and one last comment, am I the only one who finds it really annoying that the publishers of Saramago's books always give you the entire storyline beginning to end on the back cover?  
 this book was recommended to me by a friend.  I recommended it to my book club.  Most of us hated it...the women in the story were whiney women and even by the end of the story, I could not discern one from the other.  They did not handle their marital problems in the adult sense. the men were no better. I felt bad I had recommended it to my peers. I will not be inclined to read any of this author's books. I do not like her style.  It was not an easy reading for me, as it was painfully slow and boring 
 I hated this book!  It is such a disappointing series after reading The Other Bolyn Girl which I absolutely loved.  This series is centered around a incest - which is detailed graphically in the book(s).  Very disappointing 
 First, the good news:  1. I lost 8 pounds in two weeks on this diet, even with the occasional skim latte and granola bar.  2. Following it wasn't logistically impossible, as some have complained. Even as very busy grad students, my roommate and I were able to stick to it by making meals in advance and marking off on a daily list the things we were supposed to eat or drink throughout the day.  3. I really liked the cranberry water, and still make it when cranberries are in season. I'm not much of a water drinker, but enjoy guzzling the cranberry water, so it helps me stay hydrated and cleansed.  Now the bad news: 1. I gained back all 8 pounds and more within the weeks following the diet, even though I eat little junk food. 2. No noticable reduction in cellulite while I was on the plan. 3. I frequently felt hungry or experienced cravings (hence the skim lattes and granola bars mentioned above). I was having fantasies of buying a loaf of crusty bread at my favorite bakery and tearing into it the minute I got into my car. Definitely not a good sign. 4. As with all diets, food and body became an obsession. Finally, two things that made this experience somewhat worthwhile: 1. I learned about cranberry water. 2. It brought me a step closer to leaving the insane world of dieting. That was three years ago. I'm not and don't ever expect to be a size 8 like I wanted at that time, but I have no regrets. 
 This book is one of Dean Koontz's worst.  Not as bad as THE TAKING, but right in there.  OK, here is the plot ... really, really bad guy kills girl and parents.  A girlfriend witnesses and escapes only to find herself in the hunt for really, really bad guy.  Girlfriend chases really, really bad guy and craters the guy, but that's not all.  During this (yawn!) high drama, the heroine finds a little girl that really, really bad guy has (yawwwwwn!!) captured.  After knocking off the really, really (yawwwwnnnnnn!!!) bad guy, heroine rescues little girl and adopts her. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!! Oops, sorry, I nodded off.  Please Dean, can you recall this book?  I mean we aren't asking for an apology here -- just take this piece of junk off the market.  I did see where "new and used" has it for as little as 1 cent.  Uhhhhhh!  DON'T SPEND IT !!! It is not worth it !!!!  And Dean, when you are going to give your email address out to the fans?  Most authors do this.....but, you seem to be reluctant.  Could it be literary cowardice?  Inquiring minds want to know.    Much of Dean's work is excellent ..... this book isn't.  Densel Myers Yukon, Oklahom 
 I picked up this book because of the title alone.  I was interested in learning yoga, and this book seemed to be a good place to start.  Boy, was I wrong.  If you are new to the world of yoga and meditation, I do not recommend this book.  The first reviewer of this was correct in calling this book "ancient."  This writing is from another world.  Foot notes on top of foot notes.  Definitions of words and phrases cram the pages, sometimes taking up half the page.  This book is written more like a text book than a how to book.  The author is more interested in presenting his research findings of the work, than helping to explain the text in language we can understand.  And you can not read straight through any of the so called instructions given in this book.  You get to a certain step, and you are told to turn to another page in the book, which in turn points you toward a footnote, which gives you a definition of a word from the original page.  The author was to busy trying to show all the research he did, he forgot to enlighten us as to the conclusions of his work.  Check out "Integral Yoga Hatha" for a much more clear and easy to understand way to practice yoga 
 Why can't books of inspiration and insight have some humor that illustrates the points being made.  I found this tape to be maudlin and overwrought with poignancy which did not inspire me nor shed any new insights.  The stories were ok, but there is a lot more to golf than what I heard on this tape.  Needless to say, I was disappointed 
 While I have earnestly hoarded many of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt series, Kurt Austin cannot measure up to his predecessor. Sadly, this is clearly the problem with Clive Cussler & Paul Kemprecos's "White Death." Kurt Austin's character comes across to the reader as a bland imitation of Dirk Pitt as Cussler recycles several of Pitt's phrases. Additionally, Joe Zavala, while not unlike Al Giordino (from the D.P series), is far to similar to Kurt Austin, and the impressive contrast, so commonly present between Dirk and Al is conspicuously absent in Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala. Like many of Clive Cussler's novels, the novel opens with a historical expostion- here it is of a Basque merchant fleeing from the Spanish inquisition. As expected, the narrative then chronicles a maritime disaster, and the plot continues as an effort to unravel both mysteries.   The Sea Sentinel, a ship painted with a garish combination of colours, while attempting to stop traditional whale-killing, unexpectedly veers from its course to ram a Danish coast-guard craft. Naturally, the two sink into the depths of the ocean, and equally expected is Kurt Austin's lucky intervention. Here, however, the reader is introduced to yet another insidious corporation in the form of "Oceanus," a company specialising in the creation of bio-fish, mutant fish that grow far faster and larger than the average salmon. Perhaps Oceanus is behind the collision?  While this may seem like a rollicking good read, the novelis sadly diminished by the incapability of the two main characters to carry the narrative, their bland, stereotyped characters and a rather cliched plot (in particular the ending). That Cussler or Kemprecos misspells "Hiram Yaeger," a stalwart of all Dirk Pitt texts as "Hiram Yeager" compounds this problem, and it seems almost as if the novel was rushed.  In conclusion, while superficially an involving and interesting read, "White Death: is unfortunately diminished by a stereotyped plot and one-dimensional characters spouting frequent cliche. Unlike the vast majority of Clive Cussler books, "White Death" is unfortunately an ultimately unsatisfactory read.  
 "Find the bad guys and kill them", "unleash the SEAL and DELTA forces everywhere in the world to solve America's problems by assassinating the bad guys" is the Colonel's ultimate solution for securing America and Israel.   It is a bad reputation for the military to produce such dull minded people. Those oversimplify matters with no restrain of rationality.   TKA: Terror Killing Agency is one of the Colonel's gadgets in dealing with the bad guys. The author considers himself an expert in managing violence and assassination and never doubts his irrational approach by asking questions such as: Who are the bad guys? How many are there? Where are they hiding? What keeps them growing? Or what drives them to such desperate outcome?   The author throws the blame on every figure of authority for the sake of gaining public sympathy, yet without offering compelling alternatives. He worries about the safety of Israeli children, yet never hints to the Palestinian children. Assassinating Yasser Arafat is a noble goal and aiding Israel in its racist discrimination against non Jew is perfectly congruent with his American ideals. Israel is run with generals and military experts since its inception which got it in such dismal state of affairs with no friends but the US, no solution but wars.    Ideas such as democracy, justice, fairness, liberty, and pursuit of happiness could secure America more than irrationally driven anger and vengeance. Seeking the root cause of problems could render lasting solution that is hard to find by other short sighted means. The tunnel vision of militarily-minded folks demonstrates the underdeveloped intellectual reasoning in solving problems that involves intricate historic, cultural, and geographical variables. Aggression and fear are the only tools in the repertoire of militarily educated folks.  The irony of contemporary history is vividly evident in such outrageous military doctrines that emphasize technical wizardry as an ultimate safeguard to protect Nazism, Imperialism, and apartheid, the former had been defeated disgracefully by virtue of its impulsive madness and expansionism. The second has been transformed from the French and British colonialism to the American imperialism. Similarly, apartheid had been defeated in America and South Africa, yet still kicking and thriving in Israel with the support of its paternal Imperialistic America.       Mohamed F.

 Sure, the author's  premature death was not related to 'normal aging', but what are we trying to do here?...I thought that the system was supposed to free us from whatever  maladies might come our way. By the time we're dividing up the 'normal'  and the 'unusual' , we really haven't increased our chances all that much, have we? Are we to define any death under 100 as 'not normal aging', if we're on the program?  The fact is that this is a program that begins to interest people in late-middle-age, which has two sides to its misleading nature:1/The rat experiment begins at birth. Middle age humans have aleady created quite history for themselves, which can't be accounted for in any scientific way. In such cases,  the results must be assumed to be lessened to a negligable amount, even among believers. 2/ A healthy 50 year old has a good chance of making it past 90 anyway. Are the restrictors promising so much more?....As far as the rats themselves are concerned; caged rats are compulsive eaters, so comparing,(as 'normal'), to restricted rats is not valid. All we really have for the experiment is ourselves. We are the rats. Are you ready to be little hungry for the rest of your life, look like heck, and be weak as lamb, (check the followers out, this is no exageration), when it's just an experiment 
 This movie was loaned to Me, (Thank God I did'nt rent it) and is the biggest waste of a few hours of My life ever! The acting is so horrible it made Me cringe,and the cuts in the movie were done to where it seemed like it had been edited for tv.This is supposed to be a black comedy? It's NOT funny, and the so called violence in it made Me yawn, seriously, I've seen more gore on the Simpsons. There are so many things in the movie that are AMAZINGLY unbelievable, K. Sutherland walks for miles to a hospital with a bullet through His neck, head,and two in the back.R. Witherspoon overpowers Sutherland (For the second time) and strangles Him, pretty good for a 90 pound teenage girl huh?  But, I do think Everybody should watch this movie once so You can see what a movie should NOT be.(Besides, misery loves company 
 If you have read "Reunion" or "Einstein's Dreams", you'll be quite upset with this novel.    It seems rather limited in its scope, and is lacking metaphor like Lightman's other works.  He has developed as a writer since this book, however.  Don't let this one discourage you from exploring his other wonderful novels.  
 If you are interested in a book that outlines Androgen Disorders in Women, purchase "The Good News About Women's Hormones...by Geoffrey Redmond instead.  Cheung's books reminded me of a college term paper, just a lot of  citing other sources, and the source that is cited to back all the major  points is... "The Good News About Women's Hormones...by Geoffery  Redmond, M.D.  Not only is the information in Redmond's book more   comprehensive and objective, it gives a much more understandable  explanation of androgen disorders.  Stick with the M.D 
 I have to say that "Rock of Gibraltar" and "She Passed by My Window" are definitely two of the worst songs Mr.Cave has ever written. No wonder Blixa left. The only song that keeps this album from drowning is "Right Out of Your Hand", a sublime country-ballad that's way up there with "The Ship Song", "Slowly Goes the Night", and "Love Letter". Thank God Mr. Cave's muse came back after this disappointment. 
 I liked the price and all the different stitches.  However, I needed a sewing machine that would handle many varied things, such as alterations and heavy sewing.  I'm very disappointed in the lightweight quality of this machine.  The needle threader never worked and on close inspection my husband found that a tiny hook was missing that was supposed to hold the thread.  Also, the food feed stalls, jerks and surges.  This machine has beautiful stitches, but is for lightweight sewing only 
 Though I am a big fan of many dark films and movies, I usually like for them to have some sort of moral, lesson or hope to impart. Most of them do. This book is darkness for darkness sake, extremely gross and sadistic, and beyond disturbing.  Though well written, I thought it was a waste of time and offered nothing but horrific visions and bleakness.  I was so upset by this book, I wanted to write the author, but naturally, she has no public email or way of contacting.  I really think she should be hanging her head in shame for contributing garbage like this to the world.  I am no prude, extremely liberal and my favorite movie is The Crow, which is quite dark itself. But while that film is about love and redemption, this book is about terrible things.  The world doesn't need this kind of darkness. 
 Have read lot of reviews about the book. After watching President Musharraf in the Daily Show, I decided to buy a copy. Book starts of well, but as you go along you get a sinking feeling like Duh, What is he talking about? Most of the paragraphs are full of self praise and how he had an exceptional body and was a very brave gang leader ready to pick fights with people. To his credit the President Musharraf is honest and admits that he is not very intelligent. The only facts in the books are that the Pakistani Military is the worlds best, its special operations group is the best in the world and everything else related to Pakistan Army is the best in the world. West Point take note, the Pakistan Army can teach you a lesson. Due to these words which sound more like callous bravado I bothered to check the facts the author makes regarding wars of India. My two hours of research on the Internet showed that the India's air force was not `wiped off the air' in their war of 1965, nor that their 1971 war was the mistake of Pakistani politicians. Their most recent war in Kargil which he claims a victory for Pakistan, didn't seem like one from any angle. I also went through official Indian Government records and it shows that India launched an investigation into their Army's failures to detect Pakistani attacks. If Indian government launches an investigation into its intelligence failure to detect Pakistani intrusions how can they be intruding into Pakistan like President Musharraf claims?    After this I took everything with a pinch of salt. The President is also peeved that in the movie Black Hawk Down the Pakistani Army wasn't shown much. He says that the US Army Rangers and Delta Force were saved not because of their training but because the World's best Pakistani Army. Why can't the world's best army focus its energies in finding Osama, rather than getting concerned about Hollywood movies?   It would have helped if the English was good. A Mexican Immigrant can write a book with better grammar. The English makes you cry when the President "sorrowfully" pulls soldiers from a tank, and when some of the sentences don't make sense. Can't the publishers or the President who commands the world's best army find a decent proof reader? I have lost respect for Simon & Schuster.  Overall I will recommend Tom Clancy over this. At least Tom Clancy has some facts right. It's really scary that we are dependant on a man like this, and his world's best army in our war on Terror. God save Us. 
 This book turned out to be a disappointing resource.  Although the book includes 20,001 names, many are unlikely and outlandish (Klotild, Edwige, Ghislain, Ethelbert, Birtle), making it arduous to sift through to find the  names more worthy of consideration 
 I found this book to be very average. It glosses over subjects poorly, giving me the impression that the author doesn't have a great understanding of the topics discussed. If there wasn't other great books available, or superb video sites like winstructor.com I would then recommend this. But seeing as books like Mastering Windows Server 2003 and Introducing Windows Server 2003 exist and of course winstructor, then I cannot comprehend why someone would feel they got their money's worth with a purchase of this title 
 This was my first Goodkind book.  Since "Debt of Bones" was a special price $2.99 novella, I figured it would be a good way to see if I wanted to invest in any more TG books.  I was not overly impressed.  While I admit that Fantasy is not my favorite type of fiction, I was still not taken in by the story or the writing in DoB.  I felt it was somewhat flat.  If this is a typical Goodkind story, then I might be able to read a stand alone book, but there is no way I would even attempt to read a series 
  Why do publicists lie so much? A 'love affair'? This shows how unreliable the comments on the flaps and covers of books may be.    Her correspondence with Mr. Doe is scarce for a span of +20 years. And how on earth did she manage to keep the letters she sent to Marks&Co? Maybe she wrote them on carbon paper and kept the copies for +20 years? She retrieved them from the addressees after +20 years?   Leaving aside the veracity of those letters, Helene Hanff's relationship with Frank Doel is that of a customer and a seller; nothing more, nothing less. Their letters educate us about some literature and about the availability and good/bad conditions of the books in Marks&Co, in a post-war background. Not very enticing.  If we bear in mind that this is a 'diary' kind of book, it is essential that we get on with the author. But I find her writing style irritating: she often behaves like a hysterical insisting person; she over-uses words written in capital letters and exclamation marks; and always tries to be witty and funny. No wonder the attitude of londoners was often restrained and odd while she was in London.  I'm glad Miss Hanff got her letters published at last, but in my opinion this is an overrated booky.  
 Gore Vidal is a pretentious blowhard. (Like that's big news.)While I have always been fascinated by the whole Tennessee Williams-Truman Capote- Vidal connection, and, individually, respected and appreciated their talents, I just couldn't get into the erudite "man of letters" blase' musings about the burden of his genius, poor thing.  He has always reminded me of that brief character in "Catcher In The Rye" (Vidal would probably dismiss Salinger as an unprolific flash in the pan, better to write lots of crap), the one to whom, when asked his opinion of something rather trivial, has to STAND BACK, to give himself and his all-important answer lots of room. This is a one note memoir, a B flat, B for "Bitchy". Even his recollections of certain personalities I'd otherwise be curious about were overshadowed by his obnoxious arrogance. His memory (fantasy ?) of a sexual liasion with Jack Kerouac is especially repugnant, his take on this and most of his sexual experiences supposed to impress upon us that, because he is literally and figuratively always "the man on top", that he is still "all man". While I did respect and enjoy somewhat the then innovative "City And The Pillar", and thought "Myra Breckinridge" a hoot, I don't like to have to keep a dictionary next to me to get through a book. And, while my favorite reads have always been  bios, auto- bios, etc..I always find that, even when they're about some of the most revered, there has to be some element ( a TITCH would do) of humility. I don't imagine Mr. Vidal would be too heartbroken to know that this un-employed restauranteur did not enjoy his lofty parchment from on high, but, hey....it WAS twenty-seven bucks ! 
 If you like recipes with 10 or more ingredients, and you want to spend your spare time and money looking for ethnic foods and weird stuff you will only use once, then this is the book for you. Also, it doesn't get to dinner recipes until page 309. I really don't need hundreds of recipes on beans, rice, oatmeal, etc. I was very disappointed 
 how could someone who can't talk and see write a book? i don't get it at all. . . this book is black magic/ the work of the devil. my christian youth group told me that satan likes this book so I will go and read my bible 
 Lilly has always been the self-proclaimed feminist, but her influence on Mia definitely showed in this latest addition to the Princess Diaries series. Problem: Mia wants to attend the senior prom, but her boyfriend Michael doesn't want to, and it's only through him that she can go. Instead of considering what he wants, she whines and tries to subtly coerce him into going to the dance. She convinces her classmates to hire Michael's band to perform at the dance, further showing her true colors as it goes against even the band members' own wishes. The value she places on herself and her own desires, above the desires of others, is utterly selfish and disgusting. I strongly recommend NOT reading this book, it really made me dislike Mia as a character.  Why is the prom more important than respecting someone else's wishes? If Mia and Michael were so compatible, they wouldn't be split on this issue. From her insistence on the prom (which also seems uncharacteristic for her to want so badly), to the feminist view that men are oppressors and women shouldn't take their husbands' last names after marriage, Lilly's cold disregard for Boris' feelings and later hypocrisy over him and Tina, to the hateful quote that women need men like a fish needs a bicycle, and Mia's goal to "mold" her little brother into the perfect (read: pussified) boyfriend...shame on you, Ms. Cabot. You make masculinity something to be suppressed and ashamed of, when it should be revered.  Also, as some reviewers have said, 15 is a bit young to be exploring sexually, and it's illogical for Mia and Lilly to join in on such behavior. Since when does turning 15 equate with 'becoming a woman'? Kind of an odd thing to say 
 The author definitely sounds like she knows all about javascript, but there doesn't seem to be a real emphasis on teaching for a "learning" book.  The first couple chapters are a dry overview of the nuts and bolts of javascript, if you've have programming experience this will be familiar.  After that the book goes into broader topics, but doesn't do much in the way of teaching.  More examples, and more specifics would've been helpful.    I wouldn't recommend this book, there has to be a better introductory javascript book on the market 
 I was looking forward to reading this book but have been truly disappointed.  There are some redeeming features but they do not outweigh the negatives.  The writing at times seems disjointed and too full of names that I did not care about - seemed also like namedropping - not to impress but to give notice, either notice of thanks or notice of disappointment.  There were far too many names mentioned.  My thought upon finishing this book was that she kept a diary, wrote the book from it, and had someone edit the book who was not very skilled.  I expected to be informed and inspired and I was not 
 When an outsider Darwinian evolutionist embraces this book as agreeing with his metaphorical spin on God's non-metaphorical Genesis 1-11, the endorsement is telling! Matter of Days mongrelizes the Lord's documentation of what He did and when/how He did it. Whatever a Darwinianist thinks of Day 4 - long or short - Genesis clearly documents that's when sun, moon and stars were MADE, not just appeared as the clouds cleared. However, bigbangers like the author can't accept that version, so have sun, moon,stars evolving over billions of years along the standard evolutionary cosmythological scenario of Carl Sagan and cohorts. Secular astrophysics dictates, defines and determines how God intended to communicate His documentary! God Himself in His Own plaintext recording of events is dismissed or subject to secular revisionism to cater to scientific rationale. How best to handle the Bible? NOT 'God said it, I believe I know what He meant and that settles my slant on it' as Darwinianism or metaphorianism choose to spin it. Rather, 'God documented it in plain Hebrew through Moses the Prophet, that settles it for those taking God at His Word unvarnished and unredefined for modern consumption, I choose to believe the Original Literal Version over the metaphorical perversion.'  That this farce would appeal to Bible-alterers,however sincere, held intellectually captive to modern science philosophism is tantamount to disendorsement for the serious Bible-accepter-at-face-value. 
 Nothing in this book was usable for me.  Okay, very little.  If I was trying to write the next _Ethan Frome_, then this book would be perfect.  Instead I write sci-fi and fantasy.  I was looking for tips to improve my description of things; this book recommends describing different things.  Too much emphasis on metaphor (which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious).  If you want to write in a way people might actually communicate, this book might be a waste of your time.  HOWEVER, poets and pure-literary writers might find it more useful than I did 
 This bike may be cute, but it tips over too easily.  My daughter was on it for 10 minutes and she tipped over several times, then would not go on it. I returned it to the store, after reading on this site that it is obviously a common problem with this bike.  
 I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate.   -Positives- fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.  The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.  that's about it.  -Negatives- The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent.  The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.  Its very long.  Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long.  That's pretty conspicuous.  It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).   I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood.  2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak

 I could barely make it through this book.  I found a copy downstairs in my apartment building and thought it might be a nice read.  I enjoy knowing what people find meaningful in their lives.  This book is nothing more than a bunch of self-entitled snobs whining about their jobs.  I decided it would be best to throw this book away and top it off with my spoiled yogurt so nobody else would be subjected to this nonsense.  
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 That title probably gives the wrong impression. But there are a few different types of musicals. The ones that you have to see to understand, the ones you can just listen to and get the jist of it, and then those that some one has to explain it to you after you've seen and listened to it. This show is one that you have to see. I haven't seen the show, so this revue is based soley on my impression after listening to it, and I wasnt really entertained. A good bit of the music is tap dancing, and that just inst as thrilling as it would be if you were seeing it. So, know that a good bit of what you will be listening is tap dancing. The actual singing has some good moments. Its also has some extremly grating moments, which may have been for effect in the show, but not pleasent to listen to. I would definitly listen to samples of as many songs as you can before you decide to buy this one. Collectors should get it just because they collect, but others should probably not by this one blindly. If your getting a gift for someone who likes "musicals" this wouldnt be one to get.

 Hank obviously is unhappy with the emotionalism that comes with revival, healing, and signs and wonders. In reality many of the healing miracles done through the healing movement have scientific and medical proof.   That doesnt mean that the healers are not sinners just like you and me. It does not mean that the revivalists are not normal people. It just means that God works through real people to make miracles happen. Which sounds alot like the book of Acts. Hank probably wouldnt have been too comfy if he had been at Pentecost. 
 If you are an environmentalist or a liberal of any strain, this book is for your kids. It is not, however, for mine. I was excited to read it because at first glance, it presents an attractive and manageable timeline of American history, complete with helpful appendices including all of the important documents that are no longer priorities in the schools. As Mr. King gets closer to current events his bias becomes more evident and more difficult to stomach. Listing all of the examples here would be impossible, but he neatly boils the Reagan era down to homelessness, the national debt and the failed War on Drugs. President George W. Bush is simply defined by the Florida recount, the "disappearing surplus," and withdrawal from Kyoto. (The War on Terror is mentioned in the "Terrorism" section and President Bush is criticized for creating additional Arab opposition by calling Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, "the Axis of Evil.") I had hoped for a fair and balanced look at American history, and this fell far short of my expectations 
 I own have been using "Black Hat" feng shui for the past year and half. Now that we are planning to move to a new place, I decided to look into it more in depth, especially since doing some research I found out that Black Hat feng shui is poo-pooed by many feng shui practitioners as an alter-ised and westernized  form of feng shui that's really too far from the original to work.  Browsing and researching, I came up with a few titles that were highly recommended. I ended up getting this one because it seemed like the most complete.  OMG, was that ever a mistake. There is so much involved between calculations, cartography and so on that the only way to have a house that fits into your ideal feng-shui "picture" is to have unlimited cash, location and placement possibilities when building your own. No way you can apply this if you are renting, especially if it's a smallish apartment or house and you don't have many different ways to set-up the space.  I think I'd MAYBE recommend this to someone who is building their ideal house and has time to look for a good place to buy land etc, basically starting from scratch with the book. Otherwise, the knowledge would be purely academic and not of much use.  If you want applicable knowledge and tips on how to set-up your house/apartment, get "Clearing the Clutter for Good Feng Shui" by Mary Lambert instead, and leave this complicated manual on the store shelf.  And as a side note: Black Hat feng shui may be considered inferior, but at least it's easy to understand, fun and inspiring. If you are interested in learning more about Black Hat feng shui, the book to get is "Move Your Stuff, Change Your Life" by Karen Rauch Carter.  When I think of our new apartment, I think about creating something that feels like home, a place to unwind and feel comfortable, a place that reflects US, not someone else. Creating your own living space should be an inspiring creative process, not a chore or something you dread. It should feel like fun, not hard work. If you agree, then this book is really not for you

 This book is a waste of time and money.  It presents nothing that two other more significant works do not already present in more accurate, better edited ways.  These two other works are:  1)Inside the White House: America's Most Famous House, The First 200 Years by Better Boyd Caroli, published by Canopy Books; and 2)The White House: Its Historic Furnishings and First Families by Betty C. Monkman, published by Abbeville Press.  Caroli has much more research experience with the White House and the nation's first ladies, and Momkman actually worked in the White House Curator's Office.  If it were not for sloppy editing and factually incorrect information, the Whitcomb and Whitcomb book would be a nice addition to these two more accurate, and frankly more interesting works.  Grammatical and punctuation errors pepper the entire book and really take away from its readability.  Worse are the blatantly wrong facts presented in this book.  For example, on page 371 in the chapter on Lyndon Johnson, Clark Clifford's wife is erroneously called "Mary."  Her name was actually "Marny," which was a nickname for Margery (Margery Peperell Kimball).  The authors interestingly cite Clark Clifford's memoir, Counsel To The President published by Random House, as a source of infomration for the chapters on Presidents Truman and Johnson.    On page 395, in the chapter about Richard Nixon, the authors state that Daniel Ellsburg was a psychiatrist.  Had the two authors consulted Ellsberg's memoir, Secrets: A Memoir Of Vietnam And The Pentagon Papers, published by Viking Penguin, they would have seen that Ellsberg is indeed NOT a psychiatrist, but that he earned a doctoral degree in economics from Harvard and later worked in the Pentagon under Secretary McNamara.  The authors are undoubtedly confused;  there was a break-in at the office of Ellberg's psychiatrist (a Dr. Lewis Fielding...the real pshychiatrist), which was a scheme carried out by G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt.  Another misconception put forth by Whitcomb and Whitcomb on page 395 is that the so-called "White House Plumbers" were the infamous Watergate burglars.  The team known as the Plumbers consisted of four men:  Liddy, Hunt, Bud Krogh, and David Young.  Only Liddy and Hunt were present at the June 17th break-int.  However, they were not members of the break-and-enter team.  Hunt had recruited five cuban nationals and two Americans, one of whom (James McCord) worked for the CIA and was director of security for the Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP) to go into the Watergate.  The authors negelected to consult the most accurate account of Watergate and events leading up to the infamous burglary, Watergate: The Corruption Of American Politics And The Fall Of Richard Nixon, published by Simon and Schuster.  This book is the accompaniment to a documentary on Watergate developed by the BBC and the Discovery Channel.  These mistakes make me wonder what else the authors got wrong....and such factually inaccurate information really takes away from a historical work.  I encourage readers to consult the Caroli and Monkman books for all things White House, as well as the independent biographies and memoirs of the presidents, first ladies, and their staff members (e.g., the memoir by Clark Clifford) instead of wasting their time and money on this sloppy attempt at historical writing. 
 This is a deeply flawed book. It purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy, but it is based mostly on their self-assessments without comparison to a control group. I suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success, and attributes causation where there is only correlation. Further, the author displays clear biases on a number of topics, which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data, sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the data--such as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires.  On pp. 33-35, the author looks at success factors, and compares to the role of luck on pp. 82-85, which he downplays in favor of discipline. While he touches on the importance of having the right connections (and the genetic contributions to intelligence), on p. 85 he asks "what does luck have to do with graduating from medical school? What does luck have to do with successfully running a medical practice? Very little, according to these physicians." But what does luck have to do with being born into a family and in a country where one has a chance to reach adulthood, let alone be able to attend a medical school? Quite a bit.  Unlike its predecessor, which looked at prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAWs) vs. under-accumulators of wealth (UAWs), this book focuses on millionaires (PAWs) and decamillionaires (a tiny subset of PAWs, those with net worth $10M or greater). The lack of comparison to the general public serves to limit the book's value.  A misleading comparison between businessmen and stockbrokers on pp. 76ff makes the point. Stanley states that the former is an occupation more likely to have higher net worth. But this comparison is misleading because he's only looking at the millionaire-plus sample; he is excluding more of the total business owner population from his sample than stockbrokers. The average and median income and net worth for business owners are likely lower than for stockbrokers. If he made the same comparison with actors or musicians to stockbrokers, for example, the problem is more obvious--by excluding all those who aren't worth $1M or more up front, you exclude the vast majority, and pull up the average. With stockbrokers, on the other hand, a higher percentage of them are in the top income earners and wealthy.  On p. 110, after having pages about the importance of ethics and advising "Never lie. Never tell one lie." (p. 55), he passes right over his example, Mr. Warren, lying about being a college graduate in order to get a job, without comment, and without noticing the hypocrisy.  On pp. 173-174, the author wants to make the point that prayer is important for millionaires dealing with stress, despite the fact that the majority of his surveyed population do not regularly pray. (He repeats this again on p. 370, saying "nearly one-half of the millionaires (47 percent) engaged in prayer. ... for a significant percentage of millionaires, their religious faith is a major force in their lives.")  In trying to emphasize the point (p. 174), he splits his sample into "religious millionaires" (RM) and "other millionaires" (OM), observes that 75% of RM engage in prayer while only 8% of OM do, and points out that this is "a ratio of more than nine to one." This is a meaningless comparison, however--RM make up only 37% of his total population of millionaires, so his "more than nine to one" ratio is really nothing more than saying, of those millionaires who are religious, three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer (and 8% of those who do not consider themselves religious pray anyway). Since the OM population is much larger than the RM population, in absolute numbers that's not a nine-to-one ratio--his numbers show that about 28% of his total sample are RM who pray, while 5% of his total sample are OM who pray--closer to a six-to-one ratio.  But more importantly, the author glosses over the fact that not only are the majority of millionaires not religious, even a quarter of those who are don't engage in regular prayer! Given that the U.S. is one of the most religious countries in the world, the fact that such a low percentage of millionaires are religious is quite interesting and worthy of further exploration as to the cause, but for Stanley, religion and prayer are an important foundation of the "millionaire mind," and he completely misses the opportunity to find an explanation for why millionaires are so much less religious than the general population.  In a later table in the book on p. 366, he shows activities engaged in by a sample of 733 millionaires during the preceding 30 days. The table includes 52% attending religious services, 47% praying, 37% attending religious events, 22% Bible/devotional reading. These numbers don't quite match up with the RM/OM data from pp. 173-174, which seem to show even lower levels of religious activity, but these are still lower than they are for the nonmillionaire population--and weekly church attendance is notoriously over-reported in surveys. Work by Mark Chaves, C. Kirk Hardaway, and P.L. Marler in the 1990s found the actual percentage of attendance about half of what surveys show. This actually could mean that millionaires attend more often, if Stanley's survey results don't have similar over-reporting.  The author's religious bias further leads him to recommend to a student going through a divorce that she, despite not being a church attendee, search for a mate by joining a church group (p. 268) because she "believed in marriage and the traditional family concept." He writes that "I believe that one is likely to find better prospects in a church setting than in singles bars. Of course, there are no guarantees, but people with a religious orientation are more prone to respect the principles espoused in the Good Book." But why is he just guessing on this? Hasn't he asked his population of millionaires--the ones who are 63% non-religious--how they met their mates? He did this, very usefully, regarding how millionaires purchase their homes (pp. 315-326)--yet isn't picking a partner even more important?      This book has some interesting data, and is at its best when giving comparative results between populations (e.g., the house-purchasing characteristics of economically productive millionaires vs. non-economically productive millionaires in chapter 7). But it doesn't stand up well in comparison to The Millionaire Next Door, which is a much better book 
 This movie is weak, poorly written and has some laugh-out-loud stereotypical cop-schlock dialogue. The acting is sub-par for such a wonderful cast. How numb are we to poor writing that we accept such drivel? I'm amazed at the way people compliment this film. Really- Deep? Symbolic? c'mon! This is film is as about as deep as a kiddie pool 
 There's a reason you don't know much about his earlier career.  If you want to listen to a sucky indulgent late 60's California band, get QuickSilver Messenger Service first album.  At least Sailor had a minor hit (Living in the USA).  I would be more lenient if this was the first album.  Seeds of potential can be heard on some of the tracks, but he's got a long way to go. He must have been connected, I would not have let him record another album after the first.  But, good thing they did because he was much better in the 70's.  
 Yeah, right. Have you ever seen such bogus drivel as the fake reviews posted here by the publisher 
 Mr. Braden has a nice idea, but where is it?  Unfortunately, this books has poor flow, and the most wild jumps to conclusions I have ever seen.  For example, he decided that by finding a monastery library in Tibet which claims to hold documents "from everywhere," that this suddenly means that he has found the lost and untouched storage of ancient Essence knowledge!  Wow.  He really needs to get more credibility.  Most of the book is spent discussing examples of fortune telling through the ages.  But he makes no connection anywhere as to what this has to do with the Isaiah document he refers to.  Sorry, Mr.Braden.  I would like to have enjoyed the book, but I think it could easily have been summarized in few paragraphs, outlining your personal views of prayer:  for this is really what this book is about.  Reader beware.  It is a royal waste of time.  Anyone interested in this subject will find a much better and much more enjoyable reference in a book like "Excuse me, your life is waiting." by lyn grabhorn.  
 DO NOT order from this company. The cable does not fit in the phone. Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before purchasing from Eforcity. The cable came a few days late. When it arrived, the cable did not even fit. The software for the cable was defective. After it had finished installing, Windows XP came up with an error message that stated the completion of this installation could cause corruption with the operating system. Eforcity is awful 
 I got this book thinking it might give me some insight into how Coach K motivates his teams, organizes his practice sessions, and instills leadership qualities in his athletes.  What I got was a less than thrilling re-hash of some of his best quotes as seen through the eyes of a local news reporter.  You'd have to be a true Blue Devil fan to like this book.  I didn't, so I gave it to one of my co-workers who graduated from Duke.  He likes it 
 Why do some white kids like hip hop?  probably the same reasons why children have tried to shock their parents for ages. Hip hop (what a name)is the product of cultural nihilism, a direct result of the black underclass which seeks to return to the "good old days" of blaming whitey. After all it's whitey who told us are BAD-so Bad we will act. So there you have it, instead of Black Americans working hard to become successful, many prefer to follow a congo beat while fondling their fake bling-bling while watching underclothed women gyrate their rotund bodies.   Those writers who claim that hip-hop is another culture whites want to steal are delusional at best. When I'm stopped at a stoplight and the car next to me is shaking with a loud bass, all I can think of is: "thank God I lack their culture"!       But let's think about this! Remember the days when the world "culture" actually meant something. If one studies the culture of the Greeks or Romans we see a the long history of a particular society. A history built on art, language, law, philosophy, religion,music,  architecture and myth.  Hilarious enough, the so-called hiphop culture began with a myth:"the myth that poor latinos and blacks created hiphop out of nothing: (this was a direct quote from a misguided latina at an education conference at UNC.     And the myth continues, according to another site, the author claims that hiphop is instrumental in making social/cultural changes in the larger society.   A recent hiphop conference (pretending to be a political entity) presented the (world),or at least their "hood" with a list of demands, including full reparations for blacks, free education, free health care, all in a beligerant and hostile "gimme" tone.     The angry person who referred to me as an idiot may need to remember the words of the rapper Tony Yayo who raps:" I'm in that brand new range:when I pull up, kid, I turn your brains into red concrete stains."  I ask you-and others-is this a culture-or is it verbal poison?    
 BORING!!! Why are these girls all hacking out the same tunes with the same emotionless sound. 
 The author substituted Elvis trivia for character development and made EVERY major character spout said trivia at the drop of a hat.  Maybe having one avid fan pop in with some tidbits now and again would have been bearable, but this felt almost like a lecture with a few murders thrown in.  The lack of susbtance shows 
 The Language activities are often book specific, and the activities are designed for younger children--through 8th grade 
 This pile of steaming crap is one of those message movies that comes across as pretentious, self-righteous nonsense.  There is a big difference between the quality of a movie and the message that it attempts to convey.  Powder may be trying to convey a lofty message, but I assure you that the presentation is laughable and just plain stupid.    The only people that could possibly take this dog excrement seriously are those individuals that like to sit around and brood that nobody understands them.  A terrible, terrible, terrible movie 
 I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer.  The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel.  I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them 
 More regurgitated destructive orthodoxy from the arid soul of an academic hack, it's all here every careerist leftist's cliche there is.  The arrogance of the previous reviewer could only come from a button down Yalie politically correct snob 
 This book is an outdated snapshot of Wicca in the 1970's. It does not accurately reflect Wicca now, has some incorrect history (especially in regards to the genesis of certain traditions), and is completely impractical.   If you are trying to learn about modern Wicca/Paganism and how to become involved and how to practice...this book will not help you. There is nothing here that shows you HOW to practice, nothing on how to learn, how to study, how to work ritual, and nothing here that gives a clear picture of the basic parameters of the Wiccan/Pagan Religions. It is overly long, too dry, and uninspiring. Completely impractical.  It gets two stars because of a great chapter on the Radical Faeries Movement and Men's Spirituality (wow, there's actually a God in Wicca?) and some interesting photos within.  This book was not for me, I don't recommend it for beginners or old-timers or even in-betweens like myself. It's "okay" but nothing special. Just...boring, and not helpful.  Far more practical, applicable and helpful (and in the same vein timewise and politically) is The Spiral Dance by Starhawk, it gives a much clearer picture and doesn't seem to ramble as much.    
 This book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998!!!  Totally out of date! Useless!! Wondering why it is still for sale.  The author, contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked, simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one...  Outrageaous!  Spread the word and if you own the book, get your money back 
 This is one of the worst books I've read!  It was poorly written, (lot's of type-o's).  I also did not like the authors writting style.  (he jumps around topics too much).  I have read a lot of IT Books this last year and a half(over 50) and this is the first book I came across that I had to write a review about.  I caution you if thinking about buying this book.  The book I am reading now is Data Network Design 2nd Edition (reprint by Mcgraw-Hill copyright 2000 and it says it contains select material from this book)  I don't know maybe McGraw-Hill screwed it up royally because the other reviews I've read are all high marks 
 This product is absolutely useless.  Save your money.  The first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it.  In addition, there's no way to attach it to the carrier, stroller, or whatever.  So when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it, all it does is slide around.  So it's more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout 
 Sorry to be extreme, but after dealing with infertility for two years I'm finally pregnant thanks to IVF. I am disgusted by her obsession with her thinness ( I was a size 6 when fertility treatments started two years ago - now I'm a size 10 or so and wouldn't trade it for anything because now I get to be a mommie). Her smoking was disgusting...Her declaration to "cram" for all her baby knowledge was appalling. What an idiot - I rarely feel so strongly about a book but this one pushed me over the edge. What an insult to pregnancy and the life process. I'm throwing it away... 
 I have lived in Japan for 10 years, and I don't know where this man got all his misconceptions and false assumptions.  The Japan I know is nothing like that described in this book.  This ranks up there with the movie and book, Rising Sun.  The sad thing is that this book has received awards and praise from the literary establishment.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I know it is not easy to write novels, so I will try not to be too critical here.   As a diehard Voyager fan, I was instantly disappointed that the author left Janeway out of the entire book, and just when things with the Nacene battle started to get good, the author takes out Torres!   The 2 biggest heros of the series are MIA.  The book was narrated too much.  It got boring.  I loved the first two in the series.  This author needs to watch Voyager a few more times to understand the appeal.  (especially the appeal to female trekkies)  Other than that, God bless her for trying to write star trek... sci fi is difficult.  
 I'm sorry I wasted the afternoon reading it....was about the worst thing I have ever read in its category.  Would have liked to rate it as NO stars but that is not an option.  Just happened to read it because it has been sitting here for 4 years since my mom died and I took i 
 Essentially the book is a rehash of the old creative financing techniques touted by the real estate gurus of the 1980's. And where are they now?    With the exception of some updated techniques for the Internet, the approach is the same: 1. Find people with money. 2. Find sellers who want to dump their trashy properties, then put the two together.    Since it always takes money to make money the whole scheme is dependant on your being able to find "money people".     If there is any value in the book it is that it is a much cheaper way to get this type of info than having to buy the high priced infomerical stuff.    True, there will be a few who will make their fortunes by buying fixer uppers at a discount but most copies of this book will end up with all the other "real estate riches" type books - selling for a buck or two at the used book stores 
 This book is a rehash of a number of other general management and time management principles found elsewhere, which may still be of use for a lay-person but is certainly not for project managers or anyone else who manages multiple projects for their profession. There are a number of other books on program management which are much better suited for that purpose 
 Luckily, I checked this out from the library rather than purchasing it.  This very thin, very basic booklet is more like somthing I would expect to get free as a promotional item, not something I would pay $12.95 for.  If you've ever been in the workforce, or your mother taught you anything about how to dress and act, you don't need this book 
 Don't get me wrong, NFSU2 is a great game but it just doesn't warrent this book.  I thought it'd be helpful but it wasn't and I just went through the stages of the game without the book and did just fine.  There are plenty of free guides over the internet anyways 
 How can you write a book about the Battle of the Bulge and have no maps. I knew when he said oral history there would be no detailed analysis of the battle 
 As a novice biker, trying to understand how to maintain and repair my bike, this book was almost useless to me.  There is not even a diagram of a bike naming all its parts!  The authors have assumed that the reader has  some knowledge which is a huge mistake.  Sorry, lads.  You're going to have  to do a lot better to come up with a book that's clear, easy to read, and,  much more fun than yours is 
 For optimal being. one must overcome greed, illusions, and hate, and one must strive to achieve love and compassion.  Sounds interesting but unfortunately this one sentence is virtually all Fromm has to say on the subject.  After stating this, he then warns the reader that he has no intention of discussing the matter any further.  Instead the book is comprised of a series of random thoughts, all very brief, that are only marginally related to the art of being.  When he does elaborate, he merely goes off on a tangent with a quote from Freud or a reference to Marx (his gods).  I found this all rather loathsome.  I can only conclude that people who enjoy reading this drivel must be psychology majors.   This is one of the few books that I threw into the garbage upon reading it.  
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 This book is WAY past its pull date.  Full of warnings about not calling back the unrecognized number on your pager (pager?), the ease of using a consumer-grade scanner to evesdrop your cell phone calls (not since the cell network went digital!), and how you should shred paperwork with identifying information on it (duh!).  The over-riding assumption is that anyone with something to hide must be a criminal.  The reader is told to vary your hours, commute route, and habits so 'they' can't catch you, because you must be trying to get away with something.  For the rest of us law-abiding types, the message is "privacy is obsolete.  get over it."  Even worse, the author and the ghost-writer (this is one of those books by someone WITH someone else) must have been paid by the word.  It goes on and on and on, just to convey the merest morsel of a factoid.  But worst of all, the author is such a big shot, you're supposed to be really impressed with the names he drops and the James Bond-style exploits he pulled.  He walked right into office buildings after-hours and stole bags of trash!  He staked out the parking lot of the YMCA residence and guessed that the only non-hoopty in the lot belonged to the embezzeler!  He shoulder-surfed the old man in line in front of him at the bank to learn his identity!  Shaken-not-stirred stuff, you bet!  I have a lot of books on my shelf, and I don't mind reading a lot of pages to get a little information.  But this turkey yielded NO information of use, and so it went right back in the box and back to Amazon.  
 I'm a big fan of Capote but unfortunately this book just doesn't do the man justice. Granted it's unfinished...but still, I was forcing myself to try and finish the book - something I have never done in his past novels. The "La Cote Basque" chapter is alright if you are into "Old Hollywood" but still Capote's sloppy writing is all too evident in this unfinished novel.  But if you want to remember Capote for his much better works, skip this titl 
 I only bought this dvd so I could watch the second disc with the version of the movie in HD (WMVHD) but since I don't live in the US I could not obtain the license to watch the movie cause of the stupid DRM bullcrap they encoded the movie with. After weeks of trying different things I finally got it to work but even now when it tries to play it makes the computer system unstable and the movie only plays one frame before going green.  STAY FAR AWAY. Don't buy DRM encoded stuf 
 This film was one confusing blob of a mess. One of the worst films I've ever seen. It made me never want to read a Ludlum novel, since that's what it was based on. When I heard an audiotape of Ludlum's memoirs, and he said how he LIKED this film, it REALLY made me never want to read one of his books. Even Michael Caine in his autobiography says that when he got on the set, he read the script more closely, only then to realize it didn't make any sense. But he was stuck, and had to film the darn thing 
 i love nature and cowboy movies.  Jeremiah Johnson was on of the best movies i've seen.  it is unforgetable.  It was my favorite  RobertRedford movie.  He did very little talking talking in this movie, he just acted, his best performance ever.  the movie deals with the american indian also, in a profound and touching way.  this movie is engrossing and based on a true story,  it's simply the best. Don't miss the opportunity to see this movie, it is a classic.  It truly is in a league of it's own.               
 The heroes are all the same, interchangeable except for name and title.  The heroines are also all the same.  There's a random plot of only tepid interest out there, which is grafted onto the romance willy-nilly, presumably so that there's something to interrupt the lengthy snog sessions and get the book over the requisite length.  The only conflict between the hero and the heroine is the only conflict that there ever is in a Laurens' novel:  she wants to marry for her love, and he's too idiotic to tell her he loves her, and she's willing to sleep with him, but can't bring herself to say, "I only plan to marry for love, so either fish or cut bait."  You've read this novel before.  You've read it many times, and each time Stephanie Laurens' name was on the front cover.  I don't know why I keep buying these, but I have to stop.  I'd like another plot, please.  This book is the same old Laurens over and over again.  Save yourself some money and reread her backlist.  You'll get the exact same experience as if you'd read the new one 
 I was a bit disappointed in this tape.  The workouts are too easy.  I had mastered  Abs of Steel I and was looking for Abs of Steel 2.  I couldn't find it so I bought this one but its too easy.  I found a used Abs of Steel 2 and I like it much better 
 Several of the reviews echoed exactly as I felt--too many apologies, not enough substance.  It's fifty-some pages into the book beofre the first substantial scriptural reference is made!  Since I am currently dealing with my pet-loss issues, I feel as tho' several titles offered by Amazon were much more thorough and scriptural-based!  I've you're thinking of buying this book and need some real consolation, my advice is to buy another title 
 Did not like, thought stories were full of Idealistic nonsense. Unrealistic options for the family farmer. 
 Hey here's an idea. What if Hitler was right all along, only it is men, not jews, who are to blame for all the woes of the world. We should build a new Auschwitz and exterminate them all. Right Andrea? In my opinion, this is just as bad as any misogynist. It's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women's liberation movement back for so long 
 I would like to see those negative reviews if they were posted.  Why did they get removed.  It is clear that not everyone agrees with the reviews presented here. I did not find the book as informative as the others here. I found it leaves out a lot of other high-quality and very creative artists.  Please return the negative reviews a mentioned in the one review so we can make our own decisions 
 It's too bad Mr. Ridley doesn't put as much effort into examining the effects of the social environment as he does into genetics. Obviously genes have an important effect on behavior...DUH...what else is new? Mr Ridley need to enroll in graduate school and spend several yrs. researching the effects of social structure on behavior before he writes another book. He grossly over simplifies research methodologies while displaying his biased opinions based on anecdotal information. This book is not a balanced discussion of research but a vehicle for his poorly-informed views 
 just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. 
 If you know anything about Army aviation or Apaches, Fire Birds will either tick you off, or make you laugh till you puke. This was supposed to be the Army's Top Gun? So sad. It's so unrealistic, I wish the Army had had veto power on this one before it was released. 
 A great story, but not very well told 
 I was sooo dissapointed once again when I saw that they replaced the original soundtrack of this soap with stupid hiddeous midi music, the sound is soo cheap and it gets so annoying that you just don't want to keep watching. Other TELEVOVELA DVD's with this horrible sound: ROSALINDA, ABRAZAME MUY FUERTE.. who knows how many more.. it's terrible 
 I'm not sure, maybe I just got ripped off, but is there supposed to be only 1 song that is 9 minutes long on the cd?  
 I was really disappointed especially because I had read so many positive reviews of the book. It very boring and the only exercises there actually were was one little chapter. The book was more of an autobigraphy of the author as well as about the history of the acceptance of women's masturbation which I could have read online if i wanted to. I wouldn't consider this a self-help book at all.  
 This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read.  It is laughably hokey and unrealistic.  There is even a scene where Jason gives a karate chop to the back of someone's neck and they fall unconscious....I mean really, I thought that only happened in Get Smart episodes or perhaps Charlie's Angels.  I understand this is fiction but there needs to be some basis for reality...otherwise why not just have the characters fly around like Superman 
 I thought the book was very well written, but that the Morman angle was over the top. There are stereotypes about Mormans that are not true, we GET IT. I skipped over pages of "discussions" on the Morman faith.  If it was not for that theme, I would have reccommended this book to my friends 
 Though I found her tips on memoir-writing techniques helpful, her overall tone was a bit discouraging.  There was one part where she warned that one should always be ready to immediately capture on paper those moments of inspiration or risk losing that particular idea forever.  I personally believe that one should have faith that any really important ideas will come up again and again.  There were a lot of admonishments about the importance of doing things a certain way, and how hard it is to follow through and actually write a memoir.  I may never get there, but I do feel that my own creative path is better served with more affirming books.  It seems that this book is best suited for those wanting to write a "literary" memoir and is less geared for unconventional approaches.    
 The recent disappearance of Spalding Gray has made me realize what I don't like about this film: its narcissism.  It's Gray's defining characteristic.  After a while, despite Jonathan Demme's fabulous direction (he makes the  best of a limited repertoire) it just gets boring 
 I believe Macdonald is guilty and wouldn't waste my money on purchasing his story of events.  I never owned this movie, I never seen this movie, and can't understand why I was asked to review it 
 I agree with Jodi (see her review further down) -- Teitelbaum is confused into thinking that the chronic fatigue he experienced as an overworked medical student is the same as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  True CFS (which involves neurologic, endocrine, cardiorespiratory and other abnormalities, not merely extreme fatigue) has far more symptoms than just fatigue.  It's generally a result of a virus, not "burn out".  For those who have real CFS, some of the advice can be hazardous. Experts concur that exercise is detrimental, especially to those in the advanced stages who have viral damage to their heart muscle ... I know several patients who've been rendered permanently bedridden after following misguided advice to exercise their way to health.  In fact, reaction to exercise is one of the ways the experts differentiate between CFS and depression.  (see www.cfsfacts.org for details on this diagnostic shortcut)  I've tried Teitelbaum's Fatigued to Fantastic formula; even at maximum dosage, it didn't put me to sleep.  It might help if you have chronic fatigue (the symptom) from insufficient sleep, but Chronic Fatigue SYNDROME is not sleeping too little, but not feeling refreshed when you wake up even if you've slept 20 hours.  See Jodi's list of good books about the Syndrome (not the symptom); I'd add David S. Bell's "Doctor's Guide to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome" as one of my top picks 
 There is a difference between religion and culture, and although it is often difficult to tease them apart, the effort should be made. Ayaan Hirsi Ali has not made much of an attempt in her book, which seems to blame Islam for the shortcomings of Somali culture when it comes to women - and, worse, to imply that Somalia is typical of the Islamic world, which is so diverse that a 'typical' country cannot be found. Sadly, male oppression of women can be found in most parts of the world, including those with no connection to Islam - and men have often twisted religions to justify their treatment of women.   One subject she deals with is that of female circumcision in its most extreme form, that of 'female genital mutilation' or FGM. She is correct that FGM is practiced in Somalia, but incorrect in ascribing this custom to Islamic influence. She does point out that FGM preceded Islam, and started in Africa, but doesn't take pains to note that it possibly dates back to ancient Egypt (hence the alternate name of 'Pharaonic circumcision'), and is unknown in most of the Islamic world but practiced in some African countries by animists and Christians as well as Muslims.  I am uncomfortable with her writing as a spokesperson for Muslim women, since she doesn't seem to know much about Islam. Incredibly, she doesn't even seem to have read the Qur'an, since she states that Prophet Muhammad wrote about female circumcision in that book. Leaving aside the question of the source of the Qur'an (if she thinks it was written by the Prophet as opposed to being revealed by God, she is no longer a Muslim), the Qur'an in fact never mentions circumcision at all, even male circumcision.  There are also no authentic hadiths (traditions of the Prophet) in which he talks of female circumcision.  It disturbs me that Muslim or formerly Muslim women who write books criticizing Islam are immediately lionized in the West, no matter how uninformed these people are. It seems that some Westerners who are already hostile to Islam latch onto these people to support their own prejudices. Others simply don't realize that people like Ali are not necessarily reliable on the subject of the religion.  I agree with another reviewer that it would be a better idea to read books by feminists with a deep knowledge of Islam, such as Dr. Leila Ahmed, born and brought up in Egypt and now a professor at Harvard's Divinity School. She too speaks of the oppression of women, but in a more nuanced and informed way. Two of her books are "Women and Gender in Islam" and "A Border Passage," the latter the story of her own life in Egypt, England, Abu Dhabi, and the U.S. and the evolution of her thought on feminism and her religion 
 I think people have "japanese" gardens or any other type of garden but they for example don't have like english garden with a japanese touch. I don't have this book and i will not buy it, because i want a JAPANESE garden nor mexican-japanese-english-french or anything else garde 
 I committed myself to reading all of the Caudill nominees for 2006, but broke that promise to myself on this book.  I thought the whole premise was preposterous (why would great-ancestor Smith waste so much time and money building these treasure houses?), and none of the mysteries held the slightest bit of suspense for me.  I trudged my way to the half-way point, then just started skimming until I got to the end.  For all that buildup, I thought the ending was really hokey and dumb anyway.  I hate giving such a negative review, but I found nothing redeeming in this book 
 When someone in their fifties decides to go back to college as a student, their view is in no way going to be what the average student sees from college life.  The author failed as an anthropologist to report concise and accurate data, as she did few consistant studies and never reported as an unbiased individual.  Since she was a professor, she looked at college from a professor's eyes, not that of a students.  Therefore, this work is not in any means insightful as to the real college experience 
 This book is a nihilistic, incoherent work, and I dare anyone who reads this review to argue to the contrary.  Admiration for this book is humbuggery in action.  The emperor has no clothes 
 I pre-ordered this on December 10. It was going to be a gift. I recevied an email this morning stating my order needed to be revised. I checked it out and it stated that the set would not be available until after Christmas. So I canceled my order. I found out from a friend that he had ordered it yesterday and received it today. Anyway, I ordered it from A&E TV. Also, NOBODY at Amazon could explain to me what happened 
 Disapointing. Here we have a $25 book with 120 pages, probably at least 100 of which could be eliminated. The book is wordy, vague and full of meaningless examples and ambiguous statements. Don't waste your money. 
 Not just simple ideas in this one but stupid ones too.  No one should ever read this colossal waste of time unless by reading you mean beating yourself unmercifully on the face and head until death occurs 
 The theory's not bad, and, unlike Robert Venturi, Frapton can string together four or more sentences without self-contradiction.  HOWEVER.  The text here is so dry you'd almost rather eat it than read it.  Of interest  to students and serious scholars only.    Altogether too often Frampton lapses into what Robert Campbell calls archispeak, an impenetrable wall of words borrowed from, in this case for example, phenomenologist philosophers.  I appreciate that a lot of thought went into the theory Frampton puts forward, but this is not a theoretical text.  Frankly, if you're authoring a history you ought to take a cue from Wittgenstein instead:  Speak clearly or not at all.  William Curtis's book is a much better history, or at least a far more comprehensible one, as is Spiro Kostof's more wide-ranging text.  This should be seen as a companion book to either of those, a dense, theoretical appendix, perhaps.  Frampton's syntax is almost torturously overwrought, a sure sign of someone who spends much more time thinking about and researching things than communicating them (and of a real dearth of good editors in the community).  There has got to be a middle ground between the coffee-table picture book and the kind of history aimed squarely at other writers of (and future writers of) architectural theory.  (And I say this as someone who routinely reads architectural theory and loves the Modernist movement.)  If only Reyner Banham were alive to write the reply (or even clarification) this book begs.  Come back to this book in grad school, and even then sample it in small doses 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was not what I expected and I was bored 95% of the time 
 Never ceases to amaze me what people call talent these days. These guys were just on Conan O'Brien. The chick is absolutely the most tone-deaf "singer" I have ever heard. The tunes are just a bunch of meaningless chord progressions and melodies. Save your money 
 Al Franken is an individual who has been mediocre at everything, this book is his attempt to take on radio giant, rush limbaugh.  All I can say is; it is a good thing Mr Franken used Rush's name on the title, otherwise this book would have been like every other Franken project: an abject failure.  If you are easily entertained by shrill, and hysterical name calling this book is for you.  I found it sophmoric, and superficial, pretty much like Al 
 This has to be the most archaic writing I have ever seen.  I am not sure if Mr. van Dijk has ever spoken to or participated in vendor selection.  His stereotyping of vendors is offensive and unacceptable!    The sad part is that a groom will pick this book up and think how miserable planning a wedding is and how to skimp on things that he should not.    Peter van Dijk has done more harm to the wedding industry than "The Electric Slide"! 
 Okay I don't even own this or heard enough of this but from what I heard this recording is quite poor. Otep are basically a death metal band with a female vocalist. But are they the first to do it? Nope! Another death metal band with a female vocalist is Arch Enemy but unlike this band, Arch Enemy are awesome. While Arch Enemy are basically like In Flames or Dark Tranquillity with a female vocalist, Otep are more like a nu-metal band with a female vocalist. However this vocalist is cr a p! She sounds like she's screaming and then suddenly moaning. The guitars are complete garbage as well, just the same old 3 chords with no solos. I'd give this 2 stars to be forgiving but if you want a real chick metal band then listen to Arch Enemy or Nightwish instead of this mediocre group 
 Leland's attempt to document this history of the concept of hip in America is valient, but his thesis is fault at best. He tried to say that every chapter of the history of hip is related...and its not 
 I read the first 65 pages posted on the author's website.  It is not serious research.  The claims in the book are unreasonable, unsupported, and undocumented.  There are no surveys, studies, or methodology presented in the book supporting its conclusions - no empirical data at all. The conclusions are farfetched and are ridiculous to anyone who is a loving parent or spouse 
 In fact I found it to be pretty much easily summed up with one word-CRAP 
 As Amazon organizes reviews by date, the sole review (writen by noted Caravaggio scholar David Stone) which attacks this book for its unscholarly tendency to unashamedly make things up is buried deep on the last page.  Therefore, I thought I'd add another to make this fact a little more visible to the casual shopper.  A few others have noted the appalling grammar and syntax, but the real crime is the baselessness of Robb's conclusions.  Does no one care about evidence any more?  Do none of you who loved this book find anything wrong with Robb's practice of examining complex, vague, and contradictory sources, choosing the most dramatic answer possible, and presenting it as an irrefutable truth?  Caravaggio was an unconventional, brilliant man who lived a wild and crazy life--stick with the evidence and you'll still be amazed.  
 "A Facsimile of the original edition" ? My mother has an original copy (7th edition) which was handed down to her & it is now held together with tape & love. Borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so I wanted to get one for myself. I did a lot of reading of reviews & finally decided on this one. Yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without ANY cooking temperature (electric, gas or internal temps). Even the time tables on page 32 & 33 with cooking times didn't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at. My mother's does except the charts are in a different area of her book. I am sorry but I am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book & take my mother's book & write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at. There was one recipe that state "cook for 20 mins. at a very high temp" & my mothers book said " cook for 20 mins. at 450 F". It almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same. Copyrights problems?  I am returning this book because it didn't meet my expectations & felt it was misrepresented 
 In Dr Yang's DVD I expected to find a good reference for my practice of the Yang 108 form, but I am very displeased with the quality of the DVD. For the price that I paid, I expected a least good video quality. When Dr. Yang executes the complete form the illumination is very poor; there are close ups of the upper body and obviously, the movement of the legs is not seen; you get lost with changes of camera angles; at some point, you can see people in the background; and the stage is not properly set up. Also, and with all due respect, his movements are weird. I have seen several presentations and videos of other professional instructors of the Yang 108 form and there are several differences in the way movements are executed. Definitively I do not recommend this DVD to any one who wants to use it as a reference, you can use it as a movie 
 Overrated. OOooo, look at me, I write something weird. Oooo look at me, i'm so cool. There are rarely good parts to the story or interesting characters. The main character is dull, no question.  The writing is dull for the most part. There are a few pasages that are written well and inspired, but for the most part...I just finished it to finish it. 
   You know those little cloth squares you get to clean your glasses when you buy a new pair?  Here's another one of those 
 Using this book and CD-ROM depends upon being able to download the customized settings, so that the reader's PhotoShop, for example, behaves the same way as the author's PhotoShop. However, my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the CD-ROM. Furthermore, this author doesn't start at a "dummies" level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons, so I had trouble following along. Overall, this wasn't much help for me in my quest to learn PhotoShop from a baseline of complete ignorance 
 This addition to the Spenser series as a little hard to get into.  The story was rather farfetched - Boston has a serial killer, so the Boston police ask Spenser to find the killer?  And of course he is a nut-case, so of course you can guess who his counselor is, so of course we have another somewhat boring Susan is in distress story.  She's just his girlfriend, she shouldn't take up so much of Spenser's time.  Come on Parker, you can do better than this 
 Could commendations of excellence from two U.S. Presidents be wrong?  Well, I just couldn't wade through the muck.  Heavy metaphor rotation and dewy-eyed spiritual platitudes are to be expected- after all, it's a self-help book- but the book could easily be 100 pages thinner without such reliance on them.  The writing style is condescending and overly soothing, with such gems as "Now let's take a look at how creating a clear commitment separates your voice from that of Jiminy Lizard", and "Wait a minute now, I'm not going to let these Yeahbuts shoot down my dream".  And I know they are hardly the point, but the illustrations are so bizarre they reminded me of religious tracts.  I still can't shake the drawing of the Eskimo, and found the comparison of an "Inuit (Eskimo)" building an igloo to my building a satisfying career not only decidedly un-PC (odd for the generation the book is probably meant to appeal to- I get a heavy Boomer vibe), but a stretch, too.  Preening quotes are sprinkled throughout the book, from Joseph Campbell, Ghandi, Kierkegaard, and Yoda.  Sub-sections of chapters, called "Inquiries", have titles such as "Designing Your Workplace Ecosystem" and "What Game Will I Play?".  But worst of all, the book consistently gave me the sense that the motherlode of critical information was just about to be revealed, but, wait, not yet; please read some more star-shine and cloud-glow first, and your dedication will be rewarded, we promise!  This book left me itchy and bored.  Filling a notebook with my innate talents and figuring out the difference between a mission and a purpose?... honestly, I didn't feel the love 
 Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are good, but Xenocide disappoints; in fact, Card could've ended on Speaker.  Instead he takes the worn path of Lusitania for his setting again.  In Xenocide, Ender must deal with numerous impossible tasks such as solving faster than light travel, averting the destruction of Lusitania by Starways Congress, stopping a war between the humans, piggies and formics, and saving the life of an electrically based lifeform, all the while contending with his messed up adopted family of geniuses.   And Card solves all these problems neatly.  What annoyed me most was Card's sudden use of italics to gain emphasis in speaking parts.  With such overuse of this device, I found myself giggling at the melodrama - and taken out of the story. Oh well.  Card, you've got talent, and I love Ender, but 'cide should've taken Ender to a new place 
 I bought this book because it was featured in the take home flyer from school.  The story has a little boy dressing up so scarily that people pass out.  Then he steals all their candy and in one case raids the refridgerator.  He has so much candy that he can eat all he wants everday until next halloween.  I think it teaches greed and glutony.  Not really themes I want to reinforce in my preschooler 
 It was an ok book. I think that it takes a very special talent to write a historical journal and this author didn't have it. With a journal you are suppose to write your personal feelings and thoughts. But this author never really wrote Catherine's feelings, which misses a big opportunity to relate to the character. Also with journals normally that have one big problem and then small every day problems. The one big problem is resolved at the end of the book and the small problems are resolved in about a week. A Gathering of Days didn't have every day problems and had three some what big problems that were never drawn out. It is a quick read and great if you are doing a lot of research on that time period with other books. If you are reading this for fun don't bother its not entertaining.   ~Ken 
 While Conway's idea may have been in the right place, she unfortunatly did not do the required research. I am "Norse Wiccan" but luckily I did not base my Tradition on this book! (I was forwarned before doing so!)  For those interested in building a Wiccan Tradition that is Norse or Germanic based I suggest the following books:   1) Wiccan: Beliefs and Practices by Gary Cantrell    - Not Norse, but a very good Wicca 101 book to serve as      a blueprint.  2) Witchdom of the True by Edred    - Shows how Gardnerian Wicca has its roots in Traditional      Old English "Wiccecraeft" and the Cults of the Vanir from      Scandinavia who worshiped the "Lord and Lady" (Freyr       and Freyja)as there primary deities. YOU HAVE TO READ       THIS BOOK!!! It's availible from Runa Raven Press:       http://www.runaraven.com/  3) Hammer of the Gods by Swain Wodening    - This is a book Anglo-Saxon Heathenism, but if read the      above book, you see why it is nessesary.    4) Germanic Heathenry: A Pratical Guide by James Hjuka Coulter    - This is the ultimate book on Germanic Paganism. A must      read!  5) Northern Mysteries & Magick by Freya Aswynn    - Aswynn is Asatru but with a Wiccan past, so her stuff      tends to be more on the "Vanic" side. Worth a read.    Using the above books, one can build a "Norse Wiccan" Tradition that is based on the historic folk traditions of Norse/Germanic Paganism, instead of the "fluffy bunny" and "New Age" stuff that Conway does with this book, which is basically a reprint of her Celtic Magic book with the names changed to Norse Gods and Goddesses 
 I was disapointed when I saw the cover but figured the information would still be helpful.  I was wrong.  The list of toxins covers things not manufactured since the 1970's!  It also has very minimal modern knowledge of PCOS and other fertility complications.  Skip this book it needs to be retired.    Try The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy 
 I ordered this book and began to study the diagrams and directions.  I soon found that the diagrams and the directions are not the same.The diagram will show a piece cut at 14 inches the directions say cut the same piece at 14 3/4 etc... these kinds of inconsistancies are numerous in every project and if you study the pictures it is clear that the person who built these lamps did not follow his own directions.  This book was very poorly put together. I have bought many books with project plans and have never bought one with as many mistakes throughout the whole book 
 Reading a book about Mohammad by Ibn Warraq is like reading a book about John Kennedy by Fidel Castro.   Take a look on the web for Ibn Warraq and his anti-Muslim bias is clear.  Whether sweet or bitter, truth is not something your likely to attain from someone with a clearcut agenda.  But....hey,  its your money   : 
 If Pinter contented himself with Becket- Ionesco- like dialogues of the deaf, poetic renderings of fragmented human inadequacy then it would be possible to appreciate a certain poetic quality in him. But he like a good Stalinist has to dictate for us the nature of our political reality, and in doing so turns out to be a truly one- sided fanatic, choosing what to my mind, are the bad- guys in every conflict in the world. His hatred of America is in my mind sickening and unfair. He makes the best into the worst, and celebrates radical terrorists and other chic dirt.  Boo.    
 Unimpressive.  I bought this to help with overclocking an Asus P5B Deluxe motherboard (launched mid 2006) and it didn't even mention most of the BIOS options I wanted to know about.  The book advertises that it gives you 3 months access to the online Bios guide that is supposedly updated, but when I went online to activate that, it said the "promotion had expired".  It's a dictionary of bios terms, not a guide.  And the items covered are more pertinent to motherboards of 2004, not those made in 2007.  One could use google or wikipedia and get the same or better explanations as those in this book 
 Boy I had high hopes for this one. Coming off their best album, Shot, and produced by Gang of Four's Andy Gill, I was expecting a masterpiece. The opening track isn't half bad, but the rest is throw-away. Doesn't even  sound like Jesus Lizard. Go get Down or Shot instead 
 This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I enjoy all types of books and was looking for something light and entertaining as a break from heavier reading. The characters were totally unbelievable and shallow. The book was supposed to be a mix of sci-fi, suspense, and romance. The sci-fi part was fun, I'll admit. The suspense consisted of a mediocre crime plot, that was very graphic and disturbing in its description. The romance was nonexistent, unless you consider gratuitous sex scenes romantic. I know that Nora Roberts is known for the "steamy sex scenes" in her books, but these scenes were just stuck in there for the sake of their steaminess. They had no connection to the story whatsoever. The relationship between the protagonist and her husband was based solely on sex. What made this especially unbelievable was the fact that the main character was a survivor of abuse/incest. I'm no expert, but you'd think somebody with this type of background would have a few issues regarding sex/intimacy. I just thought the book was awful. Flat characters, silly predictable mystery. I left it on the train and feel sorry for the poor soul who picks it up 
 Lounger looks like it was used.  Looks like stains from tanning lotion 
 This is one of Kellerman's poorest books.  When you FINALLY get to what is going on, it is ridiculous.  Don't waste your time on this 
 Having used the third edition on many an occasion, i was dismayed to find the 5th edition so inferior---no nutritional assessment tools are included at all, and of course then, no discussion  whatever of the validity and reliability of various screening methods.  No discussion of HOW to do a proper 24 hour diet recall, just the listing of it in the assessment process.  i was further disappointed to read the statement that babies should be breastfed until the age of one year: the AAP recommendation reads "for AT LEAST one year."  
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 With such a wealth of excellent material to draw from, Cat Stevens' Greatest Hits Volume 2 could have been tremendous.  Unfortunately, that's not the case.  Not only is nearly every song slow, making the album drag terribly, but they picked some real clunkers ("I Want to Live in a Wigwam", "Daytime", "Don't be Shy").  Where are "Tuesday's Dead", "Longer Boats", "(Remember the Days of) The Old Schoolyard", "Later", and "Changes"?  Some of these uptempo songs would have been much better choices than the previously-mentioned dirges.  While I'm complaining, why in the world did they repeat a song ("Father and Son") from GH1?  The best thing that I can say about this collection is that they reached back to include material from the frequently-overlooked "Mona Bone Jakon" album.  Unless you're looking for relief from chronic insomnia, save your money on this set, and either hope that they release a GH3 containing some of Cat Stevens' better material, or pick up "Teaser and the Firecat" or "Tea for the Tillerman" 
 Romantic story of how Jo hesitates to get into a relationship with a steamy young woman whose feelings for her are more than Jo can manage. I found the story a little slow and "going around in circles": repetitions of how Jo was hurt by her ex Nancy, how she is lonely, has very few friends, and keeps rejecting a persistent Kelly. Not the best lesbian love story out there. 
 Robert Rossen's "The Hustler" is a film about relationships and self-destruction.  It is a tale about learning to triumph in life by recognizing the limitations of your dreams.     Eddie Felson (Paul Newman) is a pool hustler who wants to prove that he is the best pool player around.  He seeks out a game with the legendary Minnesota Fats (Jackie Gleason) and is crushed when the game does not unfold as he envisioned.  Felson moves on and slowly starts to regain his confidence with the help of fellow lost soul Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie).  After hooking up with gambler Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), Felson sets out for Louisville with Packard in tow to compete in a big-money match.  After getting a hard lesson on the cruel realities of life, Felson seeks out a rematch with Minnesota Fats to prove that he has become a changed man.    "The Hustler" looks spectacular in glorious black and white and the pool matches crackle with energy.  However, the character arcs are not as well engaging as they should be.  Felson's transformation feels rushed and is lacking the emotional depth needed to round out his character.  Sarah Packard is similarly underdeveloped.  Her fate should have more of an impact on the viewer but it does not because not enough time has been spent to develop her beforehand.  Scott and Gleason fare better in their roles with the latter being a revelation in a dramatic role.  Also, Newman again proves why he is considered a legend of the silver screen with his strong performance.  Yet, "The Hustler" just does not have enough going for it in the end. 
 I have owned this vacuum for 2 years. It was great at first. Now, with a 3 level house, it is heavy and awkward to lug around and the hose that serves as the main suction shaft gets clogged at the drop of a hat. I have made mess after mess cleaning out clogs in the hose and now it drops dirt everywhere I move it. The main filter wears out really fast and is expensive to replace. If I had to do it all over again, I'd buy something else. Invest more in a better vacuum- not this one 
 Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an "enriched classic" is simply the text with commentary also included. Not so, with this book. They shouldn't call it an "enriched classic". They should call it "dumbed down for lazy readers. 
 You almost feel sorry for the author.  Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations.  More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard.  And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment.  It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief.  It also feels entirely formulaic.  It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration.  There's no doubt that Iweala can write.  I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life.  I'd risk buying another book of his 
 If you have at least one creative bone in your body, don't buy this book! All it is is a guideline for executive monkeys to beget executive monkeys. It degrades and undermines the REAL talent in animation... the ANIMATORS 
 While not entirely lacking in emotional resonance, this book is definitely a drop in quality from Donaldson's science fiction and fantasy. I got the impression that he tosses these mysteries off, for fun and without much attention to detail, between writing the books he really cares about. It's not that it's entirely unworthwhile, but mostly the characters resonate only in two dimensions, and come off as insanely obtuse. The plot is so simplistic as to be laughable. You'll have it figured out by Chapter Two. This can be a fun, quick read nevertheless, but don't expect the grace, dignity, and care that Donaldson generously lavishes on his sci-fi/fantasy works. 
 Others may prefer that this isn't just a 'greatest hits' album from Disney and has new folks singing the old songs, but to my ear they just didn't have the charm of the originals and not what I want to listen to 
 I have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time.  I couldn't force myself to get to the end.  Continually I turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn't.  The way she moves the point of view from Katharine back to the story is not enjoyable.  I would hate not to enjoy Philippa Gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again 
 Just another really expensive textbook with no real information provided. The Better Homes and Garden series has much more how-to information, great photographs, and ten percent  of the cost too 
 "When No One Sees" is part of a series of books produced by The Trinity Forum (Os Guinness, project director). Their stated purpose reads: "Contributing to the transformation and renewal of society through the transformation and renewal of leaders." Toward this end, "When No One Sees" aims to introduce the topic of the virtues of personal integrity, honesty, self-sacrifice and other important character traits as exemplified throughout history.   As a supplement to a fuller study in the importance of personal character and integrity, I can heartily recommend "When No One Sees." However, as a single, primary text for such a study, this book is deeply flawed. Although Guinness uses clear "gender accurate" grammar, and cites positive characters from different ages, countries, and races, he nonetheless presents only male heroes of character. Not one woman! Half the human race is utterly excluded from the author's list of examples. While, in the inset boxes, some women have been quoted briefly, nowhere does Guinness hold up a single woman of history as a positive example of character -- not even Mary the mother of Jesus.  Near the end of the book, Guinness actually states, "Many of the greatest heroes are unknown and unsung, unaware of their own significance" (p. 253), but he then continues to exclude women. This male-dominated selectivity is not a subtle problem or defect of "When No One Sees." It is a glaring and inexplicable fault which renders the book virtually useless as a primary text for church study groups or Christian college liberal arts courses. Guinness had a good idea in this project, but he needs to produce a more thorough second edition without the obvious male bias.  
 Spreading lies about JFK Jr. and his wife using anonymous sources. People that think that this was for selling better are in denial. The reason is much more sinister. For some reason the goal of the book is to cover-up the circumstances of his death. The other reason is to diffamate his memory. Does November 2, 2004 ring a bell ? 
 I'm a business planning consultant and a client just gave me a copy of this book. Way too basic, not enough help on the most important part of any business plan: the financials. If you want to get funded, look for a better book 
 Should bore the socks off you if you have a pulse 
 This book is more of a left-wing diatribe then real, intelligent economic analysis.  
 This ambitious poetry book is based on a little known poetic style known as a crown of sonnets, used historically to honor great kings.  In this unique book, author Marilyn Nelson tries to apply it to an ordinary kid named Emmett Till whose name became household when he was brutally lynched, and outrage over his murder fueled the early flames of the black civil rights movement.    Nelson is admirable to tackle such a brutal and tough subject matter, however admiration is not enough to cover the fact that her poems are often hard to follow due to the ridged style, in addition to being tangential and lacking in any strong dramatic or emotional punch.  She writes about Till's murder as she would weave it into a floral wreath, and sometimes that leaves the reader bored and wondering why we should even care about Nelson's pretty flowers.  Her stated goal is to write about Till but he rarely makes an actual appearance in these poems, and her attempt to tie his murder into a larger history of lynching is poorly executed.  At one point she ties Till's murder to the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, which comes out extremely contrived and tacked on, since the events, issues, emotions, and circumstances are completely different.  She expands considerable ink wishing he had never been killed, which although very admirable, doesn't give her much space to explore the national impact of his death or the good that grew out of his tragedy.  In addition, her lengthy and complex notes at the end of the book are absolutely necessary to understand her many intellectual allusions and symbols.  I could not imagine giving this book to anyone under 16 and having them get it at all - I'm finishing my undergrad in two weeks and I was overwhelmed.  While the poems pick up pathos towards the end, it really is not enough to save the whole set.  The illustrations by Philippe Lardy are nice but unremarkable, and given the poignant and brutal subject matter they are severely disappointing.  Many of them are simplistic and pretty paintings of flowers and birds that fit the wreath theme but entirely loose the tragedy and power of Till's death.  Like Nelson's poems, you need the complex notes at the back of the book to understand the many symbols in the oft-abstract illustrations.  Emmett Till himself is only shown once, and the artist attempts to make him look like an EveryChild (even to the point of giving him no real facial expressions) which makes him look generic and dull.  The art shines best when it is the most simple, such as when it is a textured background for the text itself, with simple shapes instead of complex allegories.  When the best thing you can say about the illustrations is that they make nice and non-imposing backgrounds, you know the art is in trouble.  A Wreath for Emmett Till asks the reader to "bear witness to the atrocity" and take responsibility for this murder in our collective memory, but otherwise is not a call to any action or awareness.  Unfortunately what sticks in the memory is a book that falls short of its lofty goals.  
 This book is probably a great book if you a have a firm backround in lingustics, but it is hardly a "beginers book". Its introduction to the script is also very confusing. I am going to exchange this book for Thomas Egenes book, everyone seems to say that it is much more suited for the beginer 
 It was just a little over 13 months ago that Americans flushed this john and voted for leadership. We didn't buy into the lies or false claims of heroism perpetrated by Kerry and writers like Brinkley who rely on their subject for facts (fat chance)  The economy is moving well. Iraq is moving well regardless what Kerry says. This Kerry promotional piece did not work and thank God for that.  HAPPY ANNIVERSARY AMERICANS! WE ALL "FLUSHED THE JOHNS IN 2004! 
 Interesting premise, gets bogged down in complete fantasy.  Not even believable for what it is.  Second half of the movie is out right ludicrous, with stale pollyannish dialogue.  Belushi is one of the rare lights in this dim bulb of a film 
 Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn't think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I kept falling asleep the first time. The script is very weak and thus so is the story, the  acting is flat. Most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from  existing documentaries (I have seen photographs of at least one scene), you  can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for  the movie are very poorly done. Don't waste your money, if you want to  watch it, rent it, don't buy it 
 this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho 
 Ug. I really dislike this movie. Dune is one of my favorite books, and this movie totally ruined it. It is boring, confusing, unfaithful to the book, and just plain badly done. If you want to see the real Dune, watch the amazing miniseries done by sci-fi channel and it's sequel, Children of Dune. Both are much better done and much more faithful to the source material 
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters have deleted this review Three times, gotta love those lefties.  This book was written by two young university professors and comes off as an extreme ideological rant rather than a mature scholarly critique. Hacker and Pierson's main thesis is that the country has been pulled to the right by Republican extremists. HUhhhhhhh? Say What????? Are you Kidding me??? Please remember these are two very young, teachers, one at Berkley (can you say extreme left) and they are probably viewing their idea of history as 1980 on. The plain facts are that from the 1940's - 1980's, America was pulled brutally to the left. The Conservative Party was weak and simply capitulated to the powerful democrats. During the 1980's the American people realized this country's slide toward socialism, they also began to see that the policies were failing miserably to create the supposed utopia of the left. So starting from the 1980's to current day the pendulum has begun to swing back towards the center. The problem though is that the center now has been moved so far left that the republican party of today appear more like the democrat party of the 1960,s. Compare and contrast JFK's platforms with GW's you will be surprised at how many issues that JFK endorsed are considered exclusive right-wing positions today and would be anathema for the democratic party to uphold.  Starting with their flawed interpretation of the political landscape they make mistake upon mistake. Take for example the political theory that dictates that to stay in power a party must appeal to the swing voters and the middle. If any party goes too far to the right or to the left it will be penalized. Hello professors, this is exactly what is happening to the Democratic Party today. Those of us in the middle look at those in control like Howard Dean, or we see the mouthpieces of the democrats like Michael Moore or Al Franken and we are appalled. The message put forward by these people is simply nauseating to the moderates.  For example the average person hears Democrats claiming to be the party of working man. Books are written like Whats the Matter with Kanasas? Asking why middle Americans won't vote for the party of the working/common person? Never does it dawn on these talking heads that putting forward such lies are damaging their own causes. Most people know that the Democrats are in fact the party of millionaires. 64% of all contributions under $200 go to republican candidates only 35% of the common people's money goes to Democrats. But people who gave $1 MILLIOM OR MORE to politicians or parties gave 92% to democrats. We all remember Bill Clinton's tax increase that raised everybody's taxes except the top 400 taxpayers, hmmmm wonder why? And what about auctioning off the Lincoln bedroom, you see this buying of power and financing by the elites is aggravating, but it is the hypocrisy of the Democrats plays very unfavorably with moderates..  In the end the authors main thesis is so flawed that to debate the secondary issues is beating a dead horse. The facts are clear; the Democratic party has shifted radically to the left and has dragged the country along with it. We have been witnessing a swing of the pendulum back to the center. Moderates will continue to vote for Republicans as long as the extremist control the Democratic Party. Boot out the fringe left, restore some sort of moral compass and stop being hypocritical and the Democratic Party could make a comeback. As a final suggestion to the authors, get out of your leftist bubbles and talk to the moderates, you might find out the truth.  TO: MacDesinger. Why must you attack my factually correct statement and print lies? My email address is prominently displayed; you could have emailed me and gotten a education. Instead, it is you that is lying and trying to smear me. The numbers I state are for the 2000 election cycle. They are truthful and correct, it is you sir that is lying, shame on you. Next time check your facts correctly.  
 The idea was good but Natasha simply didn't have the talent to put it in written and understandable text. She switches all the time the "I", got me confused about who she was talking about, her or her aunt.She mixed both stories, suddenly she wants to explains her "great destiny" (narcissism) at the same time as she tells the strory about her great aunt. Those second, third, fourth, xth brother's wife, sister, uncles, all irritating narrative. I really tried to like the story, to pick and read and just gave me headaches trying to figure it out whose story she is talking. Go back to school. I don't know how the editor accepts this kind of book to be published, need a lot of editing. Maybe someone in the publishing house is her relative. 
 This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.  Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work.  This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition.  The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen.. 
 Living in Denmark and being very young in the fiftieths I really only knew about Tab Hunter from the movie magazines - and a few of his recordings. It is fascinating to read his account of things as they really were - I find the book a very good read. 
   I got this book from the library, after having taken out, and IMMENSELY enjoyed other books with similar themes by Indian, and/or Indian-American authors, like Kavita Daswani, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Amulya Malladi.      I might have enjoyed this book, and I could have thought it was a good book, if only the author, and the publishers had considered the print and style when printing the books.      What I am referring to, is that in this book, EVERY SINGLE new paragraph is preceded by a long hyphen (dash) which was EXTREMELY distracting, and made it VERY difficult for me to get through what may or may not have been a very good book.      The hyphen (dash) that I am speaking of is this, for example:      - She said, "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda". Then she went out to blah blah blah.      - He said "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda".Then he went out to blah blah blah.       - They said "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda".Then they went out to blah blah blah.         Because of this distracting form of typing, I was barely able to get past the first dozen or so pages.       It sounded like a very interesting book, but unfortunately I couldn't get past the constant hyphens. I'm sure its probably even harder for those with dyslexia, and other reading impairments as well as poor eyesight.      Maybe in the future, the author and publisher could think of this and maybe print the books just like other normal, regular books.    Then maybe I'd try reading it again. 
 I'm usually a Clark's fan, and own several pairs, but for some reason these shoes are not as "true to fit" as Amazon claims. I could not get my size 9 feet into this 9 1/2 sized shoe. It's possible that I received a defective product, but you may want to consider this before making your size selection, or check other shoe sites for similar comments. Good Luck 
 Oh, dear...this movie was an abomination.  Why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead?  I can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book's storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers.  But honestly...there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal.  And the film design!  Bleh!  Maybe it would be appealing to 5-year-old girls...but to me it looked garish, cheap, and...really fake.  The costuming was slightly better than our high school plays, and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated.    I felt so much dumber after watching this movie.  I feel like I need an IQ test...or a good book.  Speaking of good books, Ella Enchanted is one of my favorites.  I don't know why I thought of that book just now.  I guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it...but not much 
 Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting 
 The book provides an extremely general overview of 50 destinations.  Omitted, (I'm guessing for security reasons ) is all of Africa, India, the truly interesting islands of Polynesia (mentions Waikiki) the entire Caribbean, Australia west of Sydney and Mexico.  Standard European capitol cities get the most ink. There is nothing here that could not be found in the first pages of a Let's Go. I was really hoping for a unique insight found nowhere else. It does list a festival or two and several activities for the given city. No hard specifics like maps, embassy addresses, specific lodging, addresses of restaurants esp open to single diners or specific city areas not to venture into after dark. Lists destinations well along the beaten path.  If you are a first time traveller tho, this might be a good armchair read.  
 Casper Van Dien (Starship Troopers, Sleepy Hollow) stars as the big shot vampire whos strolls into town and he falls in love with some junkie vampire, Natasha Gregson Wagner (Stranger Than Fiction, Urban Legend) and Van Helsing, Rod Stieger (End Of Days, Mars Attacks) is after him and also there's Dracula, played by the late Robert Pastorelli(may he rest in peace, starred in Tv's Murphy Brown, Bait), who owns a night club..hmm. Van Helsing (Stieger) has his own possee, Gabriel Casseuss (Black Dog, Black Hawk Down) with his gangsta thugs who help Van Helsing in the fight with vampires. Crappy acting filled with boredom beyond your imagination. Kim Cattrall (Sex and The City, 15 Minutes) is in this movie and she has sex with a bunch of black guys in her demon form and then they turn into vampires...wow..what fun! not! it was stupid. Udo Kier (Blade, Barb Wire) also stars in a throwaway supportee role. Best line in this whole entire movie is "Count Dracula my ass!" as the black guys light and stake Dracula too death, that was the only funny part, otherwise it was a complete mess of a movie 
 'Clownhouse' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor. While hearing of Salva's conviction when 'Jeepers Creepers' came out, I never knew it had anything to do with this movie, nor had I ever heard of this in the first place. I actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'It', and came across this weird little 'Halloween'-like suspense tale. While the sex scandal never once popped into my head (except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid), I still didn't care for this too much, despite its pluses.  Like 'Halloween', this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out, but sadly, it didn't really get to me. If I was about 9 or so, this would've scared the hell out of me. I'm not saying I hated this; it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images, but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children, it lost some effect for me. I would have liked it better if I had no idea what was going on, and it would've been a creepier experience.  Horror movie fans should like this, even though I personally thought it would be better. The atmosphere is very, very creepy, and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way, but it just didn't do it for me. Rent it first 
 Can't Mark Jenkins and his buddies work out their testosterone-driven adventure needs without exploiting another culture in the process?  Stick to Laramie, Wyoming, Mr. Jenkins.  You're giving Americans a bad name 
 I bought this book at a time when I was looking for source materials on native american culture and living for the non native american person. The book came reccomended to me by a friend who owned it with a word of caution that it was just alright. I went out and bought it, read through it and found it ok in some places and questionable in others. The author does advertise her other "for sale" services quite a bit which gets a little daunting, however there are some chapters which are well written and full of imagery. The two I liked best were her chapter on crystals where she describes a gift giving ceremony between her and friends, something which I have enjoyed doing myself. I also liked the part onbuilding your own personal altar, unlike other new age authors who proclaim altar set ups and endless tools, the author of this book tells readers to have an empty altar, perhaps covered in a sacred cloth which can be a simple focal point rather than a holder of all sorts of tools. All in all If you want this book then buy it used, use those parts of it that speak to you and discard the rest. Incidently, there is a picture of the author in the back of the book and looking at her I couldnt help but feel a bit uneasy, she dosent present a very spiritual image 
 My first big surprise was the Overture.  It's the trucated overture used on the 1949 original cast recording, not the one used in the theatre and most subsequent recordings of "South Pacific."  If you want a short stereo version of "South Pacific," this is the album for you.  No dance break in "Bloody Mary," no chorus interlude in "Honey Bun," no reprises.    Florence Henderson uses two voices -- show and operetta -- and switches mid-song in a number of instances.  It's jarring and doesn't work well in establishing the character of Nellie.  Bottom line: With so many other "South Pacifics" from which to choose, this "new" CD falls close to the bottom of the list.  The Mary Martin/Ezio Pinza version, short but definitively sung, is the best. It's mono, sounds like it was recorded over 55 years ago, but is still magnificent and the recent remastering only adds to its majesty.  The 2-CD JAY recording is the most complete and gloriously performed.  The recent Carnegie Hall version has Brian Stokes Mitchell's epic "This Nearly Was Mime." The bottom of the list is reserved for the TV version with Glenn Close.  
 This book appears from amazon.com to be simply the paperback edition of the regular textbook, but it is not.  Ordering this will get you a paperback "Study Guide" instead.  The book is misrepresented or not clearly labeled on this site, and I suppose the phrase "5th sg" is supposed to be enough for us to tell what it is.  Don't order this thinking that you will get a paperback edition of the textbook 
  Physical labor sucks.  Okay, you know that, I know that, even Paris and Nicole (thanks to their reality show) have gotten it through their puny little brainage, but it's news to Barbara Ehrenreich, whose previous stints as Ph.D earner, activist and writer did not expose her to the grubby working world of dirty hands and aching muscles that most of us have managed to live through.   It's a shame. This could have been such a great book, but B.E.'s got a preconceived agenda (welfare reform is never gonna work!) and an axe to grind (unless we raise minimum wage to 14 bucks an hour!).  To prove her point she goes undercover for the better part of a year, taking entry-level, low-skilled work while staying in expensive short-term housing. Of course, she could of just crunched numbers -"Let's see, 7 bucks an hour times 40 hours, while my pretend rent is $200 a week...carry the zero...nope, can't afford it" - but that would have just given her a puny little 2,000 word article for Mother Jones.  Book deals, on the hand, require more work, more commitment, but think of the royalties, so off she goes, just like Paris and Nicole, to work as a waitress, maid and Wal-Mart associate.  At least until it gets too hard.  B.E.'s got a litany of complaints - my feet hurt, my back hurts, piss tests are demeaning, my boss is a jerk, customers are rude, my back huuuurts - and seems to think that only the minimum wager has to suffer such indignities.  News flash, Barbara!  Every job is stressful in its own way.  I'm a RN and it's a rare day I don't come home feeling like I've been beat with a stick.  I've been verbally abused and cussed out more times than I can remember, and that's just by the docs.  I've been pee'd on, poo'd on, run ragged, and called  "girl" by my stupidvisor (My response: I'm older than you, and I've had sex, and I'm pretty sure you haven't by the looks of you, so, boss, who's the "girl" here, and who's the WOMAN.)  I will admit I get paid significantly more for my putting-up-with-BS than the average Walmartian does for his.  But then again I earned a college degree, I had to pass a difficult competency test and I work under the constraints of my nursing license, for which I had to get fingerprinted and background checked.  So that's why I get paid more than a minimum wager, even though our jobs, probably 97% of the time, are comparable.  I'll give B.E. 2 stars for her writing.   It's smart and witty and at times, she borders on hilarious, especially when she's mocking the minorities and poor that she claims to want to help.  Hey, I didn't say she was compassionate, I said she was funny.    B.E., if you're reading this, consider this angle next time you want to write a book about not getting by.  Write a book about being poor and uninsured.  Write a book about wanting to advance your position in life, but not being able to, because as soon as you take that better paying job or go into business for yourself you'll be kicked off medicaid, and you'll run out of inhalers for your asthmatic kid, and you'll have to listen to him wheeze all night, and when you take him to the charity clinic a week from Tuesday, because that's the only time the retired charity doc can see you, you won't be able to afford the prescription since it's over a hundred bucks for one inhaler, so then you have to quit your job so you can qualify for medicaid.  Then when you're done with that, write another book, this time about the lack of decent public transportation in the majority of the U.S., and how this results in needing a car to survive, which leads to excessive personal income spent on cars, more tax money spent on roads and highways, to say nothing of the hidden costs of car accidents and obesity from driving everywhere because it's too dangerous, with all the cars on the road, to ride a bike.  Those books would be worth reading.   
 I bought this book because I was under the impression that Ms. Langemeier would work with ordinary people like myself - and change their lives.  She took subjects that already had a base - 401ks and properties and showed them how to use them to build wealth.  I have none of these and was disappointed that there was no spring board for me to use 
 Viewers hoping to see the controversial "pistol" scene, in which McGillis's character is forced by her jealous husband to open her legs for his gun will be disappointed to find that it has been cut from the R-rated DVD version.  For that, you'll apparently have to stick with the unrated VHS tape.  Other than that, the movie is a decent if unspectacular B thriller, and the digital transfer is pretty good 
 I had to read this over the summer for school, and I really hated this book. Part of the reason is that I couldn't relate to Selina, and the book was overly descriptive. I'll also agree with the person who said "What ending?" This book might be interesting if you're Caribbean or even African American. For a white Jewish girl living in the suburbs, it's not. 
 When I listened to the music in the movie i thought it was pretty good but when I came here to listen to the samples theire werent here.  I always listen to the samples before buying and now I cant buy it.  Amazon put on some samples. please!! 
 I heard "Heart of Mine" in the closing credits for the movie Runaway Jury.  After listening to the album, I found that was really the only tune I liked.  Peter Malick is a veteran of the hard-charging James Montomery Band (who I have seen tear up stages of Northeast blues clubs), which is why the sleepiness of most of these pieces mystifies me.  You could argue that he is going for a "relaxed" feel, to which I would repsond he succeeds all too well.  Norah Jones can sing, and sing well- no argument there, but these songs are not great.  The lyrics I found to be a little too clever, like some music student's term paper.  For most of the album I felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful.  Having said all this, "Heart of Mine" is an excellent record, and might even be worth the price of the CD.  Of course, to get the one good track, you could try downloading it for a dollar from itunes or your favorite MP3 site. 
 This book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter / paranormal investigator. Provides good case histories as well as "ghost stories" that can be used as examples on investigations 
 I was enjoying the travel parts of the book, despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by Mr. Crichton,until I reached the part where he was in Bangkok. He teams up with a journalist for a night on the town. His journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area's many brothels. Finally,  after testing the waters, the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and  suggests a child whorehouse. Crichton doesn't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him. Instead,he goes and checks the place out. He gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes. Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him. This infuriated me and turned my stomach. I threw the book in the trash. I wish publishers had done the same. FYI, there is no zero star option 
 I was very curious to see this movie because, I read an very good review on the movie, I think it said something like "if this movie does not make you stand up and be pride, then you do not need to stand", or something like that.  But, this movie was not complete.  What did Sonny do with his life after he left jail?  No one knows, because the movie was not completed.  DO not waste your time buying or seeing it 
 Listen, I don't have anything against critcizing anything or anyone, including my religion. I do however have a problem when people use lies to do so and Ibn Warraq's sources are extremely skeptical even among Muslim scholars. How he derives his arguments and the texts he does it from are rejected by the majority of Muslims. The text which he seems to miss the most about is the Quran which Muslims regard as infallible (something he doesn't mention again). Overall a waste of my time and more about his own horrible experience with bad Muslims than a bad Isla 
 I live in the ghetto(because the darkest blacks live there), am insecure about my nappy hair, will not climb the corporate ladder as swiftly as my light skinned peers, when choosing a mate I will desire a light skinned husband so that I can dip into a lighter gene pool, and finally, if I had to adopt a child I would REQUEST a light skinned one quicker than a dark one.  Slave talk, all of it!  I read this book (most of it) with a completely open mind and hoping for a well researched and fair study of black america's color complex. I ended up throwing this book across the room in frustration. This book perpetuates the myth more than black america. As a dark skinned female I felt horrible reading this, mothers don't let your babies read this, it can be SERIOUSLY detremental to ones development. In all honesty I can say with much authority (after all I have been black all of my life) that the very vast majority of black people do NOT think like this. I find it very hard to believe that it's no more than a coincidence that the authors are the two who benefit the most from the "color complex", a light skinned female and a dark male (because according to this book light skinned men lack the all important street credibility and dark skinned women are bitter and unattractive).  This is a disgraceful portrayal of what could have been a pivotal cultural study. Shame on them for perpetuating the myth 
 Mr. Blake and Mr. Bly are the "Killer B's" when it comes to encouraging creativity in ads.  They recommend holding the status quo and not rocking the creative boat.  Safe advice, but hardly inspiring to a  newbie in the copywriting field.  Follow their beat and you might wind up  like the rats in "The Pied Piper".  Better to read Luke  Sullivan's book "Squeeze This Whipple" to get your juices flowing  instead of risking creative clots with this 
 I normally don't put a book down without finishing it, especially one in the genre of classic American literature.  However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of "thy" and "thou" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, "How do you call yourself?" instead of "What is your name?" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is "How do you call yourself" better than "What is your name"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these "translations" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.  I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years don't speak Spanish.  
 First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few "novels" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. "Pop lit" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book 
 Fairly well shot and sprinkled with comedic wit, this show is rather lacking in the areas of storyline and character development.  Three friends riding the wave of partying and excitment formed by their up-and-coming actor friend destined to be the 'next big thing'.  The premise was ok, but unfortunately nothing ever really seems to happen in these shows.  The plot moves slowly, if at all, and when an opportunity arrives for the writers to create some real tension or excitment, they side-step it.  It appears that the real premise for each episode is to dangle nice cars, attractive women, and countless cameos in front of the viewer so that he/she fills with desire for such a lucrative lifestyle.  I'm all for that, but try to write a script in the process 
 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 I can't tell you how many times my eyes rolled while reading through this.  It reminded me of the worst aspects of contemporary verse--self-indulgent, cliche, and ultimately unsatisfying--a bit like eating a cheese burger at McDonald's, when there's so many better things to eat elsewhere.  The older pieces are the best, but the bulk of the rest is just silly 
 I wrote a huge review for this and don't know where it is but let me give you the short version.  They don't continue the story, that is until the end of the movie.  AND THAT WAS THE PART TRHAT RUINED THE MOVIE FOR ME. The movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married.  Enter the Bride.  She of course doesn't want anybody to be happy so...  The story is not really worth going over, it is just injected and there are no real emotions.  Except of course for an ending that really PO'ed me.  The only reason this movie gets a 2 stars and almost gets a 3 is for Christy Chung.  Not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth, she is a great actress.  So I know of 2 movies now that are only worth watching for her, this and Red Wolf.  It may be because the people she works with are so terrible, but to tell the truth, Christy Chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time.  Not a big deal since it was only like a 77 minute long movie.  
 2 1/2 stars   Attempting another soundscape masterpiece, Stratosphere has not aged so well. The music - simple, the production- dated, the performances- uninspired. There are attempts at greatness, hints of interesting fusions try to breathe a different life into the hollow art of looping. Mostly though this is more akin to like acts such as Jarre or Kraftwerk then their more inspired material. Whereas on an album like Phaedra, the mechanics of their repetition somehow liberated, on Stratosphere the mechanics enslave entire compositions into tight neat little boxes to look at, rather then truly feel. The self conscious songwriting further keeps the experience at bay, but if you concentrate more on the spaces in between the generically frustrating  fast synth-bass-cheese, you might feel a few conceptual ideas worth the investment. 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 If you want to find diverse music for a situation, you'd be better advised to use the iTunes Music Store's iMix feature to find what other people reccomend. This book mostly groups songs by title, and not as much by style. Besides, its easier (and cheaper) to use the imixes on the books site www.peachpit.com/playlistbook. Don't buy this, and spend the money on music from the iTMS 
 I did not like the book Adam of the road because it tells you a whole bunch of stuff about the characters before it gets to the story and by the time you get to the story you forget about the characters. I also did not like the fact that the book talks weird and it says like thou father I shall bla bla bla 
 Every song has the same pacing. The melodies are non-existent. If you're looking for Aja or Gaucho-styled songs, they're not here. There's really nothing to recommend this disk. He sleep-walked through the whole thing 
 Honestly, very few of the agents in this book will even read your work. Thanks to this book, they each receive tons of submissions and can't possibly read them. If you must try it anyway, check your library first. If Writers Digest is so confident in these directories, how come they're not listed in the index? Nor is Brogan.  
 This is, as other reviewers have said, a definitive and outstanding recording. But whose idea was it to put everything on two tracks? It is impossible to select sections to enjoy or to compare with other recordings. And overpriced at 40 minutes 40 seconds of music 
 This book is very confusing to read. When and where in history did something like this take place? Who is she talking about? I know it is a book of fiction, but is there any historical fact in it? One of the reviews  inside the book says "The beauty and complexity that existed 6000  years ago", and "Mackey joins the company of Jean Auel and  Elizabeth Marshall Thomas"!!! Unlike Mrs. Mackey, Auel and Thomas  research their books and set them in a real time in history. That is what  good Historical Fiction is all about 
 Very disappointed with this book. The first 10 pages are index. The last 16 pages are ADVERTISMENTS!!! The rest of the book is a bunch of previously published magizine articles discussing random parts of the lost wax process.  Half the are articles are about platinum 
 Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (Jonathan Mostow, 2003)  Okay, raise your hands: how many people didn't see this movie crashing and burning when a director other than James Cameron-- despite his dismal track record since 1996-- was attached to it? (And let's face it, Terminator 2 wasn't exactly gangbusters, either.) Still, the fact that twelve years elapsed between the second and third movies lent a minor air of credibility to it. Incorrectly, of course, but there you go.  As the title tells you, this is the story of how the machines took over the world. In other words, the very title of the film is a spoiler, since the machines take over the world, yes, in the very last scene of the film (after Arnie once again does his level best to save the world). This is pre-apocalypse John Connor (Carnivale's Nick Stahl), who begins the film as a bum, more or less. We are almost immediately introduced to Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), the woman who will, obviously, be his saving grace. This isn't a spoiler; the movie's about as hard to figure out as a four-piece jigsaw puzzle with three pieces already put into place. And, of course, there's Arnie, the good guy, and Kristanna Loken, the bad guy-- uh, girl. Gotta wonder how Arnie keeps getting crushed, melted, and elected Governor of California, but they can keep sending him back to mess with the Connor family, don't you?  In any case, things blow up, people run from terminators, people get killed by terminators, you know the drill. But, unlike the brilliant first film, and even the mediocre second, T3 manages to studiously avoid anything approaching characterization. We are given no reason to care about these characters, no suspense to make us wonder whether they'll rise to the occasion, not even a decent script for the actors to work with. This was as paint-by-numbers as it gets. Save your money, even if you can watch it free.  
 I began reading this book with the hopes of picking up some fresh ideas on negotiating.  As a lawyer handling divorce and family cases, I frequently see a high-level of emotions between parties and I was curious to see if the authors had some insight into how to this might effect negotiations.  However, this book was incredibly basic, and I'm  not sure who it was written for because all it did was state the obvious.  There are better books available on negotiation and this book does not provide anything unique 
 I am a teacher in Colorado. Being interested in new ways to stimulate my students and inspire them to learn, I picked up this book. Although its message sounds good, it is in fact impractical and impossible to apply to the classroom without losing control of the students. It is obvious that the author made up many, if not all of these stories about his successes, because he is obviously a failed teacher. I pity all of the students he has taught 
 The Cat Carol may be inspiring to some... a cat left out in the cold and the mouse who finds her and the cat keeps the mouse warm til Santa comes and finds the cat dead.... Yes, this is the story.  I did not find it uplifted and yes I can understand the symbolism of supposedly bitter enemies coming together on one special night and self sacrifice.  A great sentiment, but it didn't work for me here.     Furthermore, my 5 y.o. daughter loves cats and loved the song up til the point where the cat dies (the fact that Santa says the cat will be there forever in the form of a constellation meant nothing to her)... She started sobbing and bawling uncontrollably for HOURS.   I could not console her.   This was on the first listening and I had no idea what the song was about before hand.  BEWARE OF THIS SONG IF YOU HAVE SMALL SENSITIVE CHILDREN.    She cried occasionally for days and days afterwards as well, she couldn't get the song out of her head.   
 I have seen many pathetic films in my life. This topped them. Did I rate one star? Sorry- I meant negative 11 stars. It was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was a total waste of three hours when I could have been sleeping. There was no point. The script and storyline were pathetic. The gore was overdone- too much blood, killing, and the like. It was totally historically inaccurate, and the Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their graves. Any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic. One of the abolsute bombs was when Clint Eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either time. And somehow, without even aiming the canon, he knocks his 'friend' off his horse.   The movie is a failure. F-A-I-L-U-R-E. Crappy. Junky. Just plain DUMB. STUPID. PATHETIC.  I am not going to waste any more words on it. Just....whatever you do....save your money. Don't buy it. It's not worth 50 cents 
 It seems that the author trying to show how knowledgeable he is on the subject RF electronics. But on a reader or a student's point of view, I had learnt little from this book. The book gave only superficial views,  although it covers a wide area of subjects of RF. It's not a good book for  students. So don't buy this book, buy others. Or even a dictionary of  electronics would give you more things to learn about RF electronics 
 I have not recieved the book......please someone contact me NOW, this is the 2nd purchase I have made and not recieved my book! Very Upset!!!  Please help me! 
 The movie has a great story. Unlike Streetfighter Alpha the Movie, Alpha Generations actually follows the correct storyline. It had the potential to be a great movie, but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that will irritate you immediately. The character design sucks(Why dosen't Ryu look like Ryu?), the English voice acting sucks(I recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles) and the fights suck. The only fight worth watching during the whole movie is Ryu vs. Sakura. This film dosen't even deserve a 1 star rating. I just gave it that because there's no way to go lower 
 Beware, that this DVD does not have English audio track despite its Amazon description. This is an outstanding movie, but Amazon has wrong data and issued a full refund for me 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 After slogging through this overwritten and overwrought account of the author's obsession with Mr. Rainier, I lost what little interest I had in ever visiting the place. The mountain is painted as dreary and gray, with grimy little spots of human encroachment.  The only moderately interesting part of the book are the chapters on the Himalayas and high altitude climbing, which, if Barcott stayed on point, would not even be in the book. No wonder his girlfriend got fed up with him; he is not just a bore, he is a bore with an ill-defined and pointless obsession 
 This book does everything exactly WRONG. He asks over two thousand women what they THINK they want in a man, rather than who they actually fell in love with.   Everything has two sides. Nobody is strong and sensitive, pasionate and gentle. Rational and emotional. Tall and short. They are opposites.  Women fall in love with men who are stronger than they are... Then they spend the rest of their lives complaining about them. Why? These guys cause women so much heartache, yet they keep falling for them.   Love and lust are emotions. Here's a tip... If you ever read profiles on a dating site, look at what a girl says she doesn't want, and be that bloke. Because that is exactly the type of guy she falls for, again and again. That's why she (rationally) asks for the opposite. But love is emotional, and she will continue to fall (lust-fully) for these guys.  Love and lust are emotions. They are not logical. This book confuses the two. This book ends up being a damn good guide about what NOT to do.   If you want to be the 'guy' friend of beautiful women, the guy they call when they are feeling bad, then read this book. They will call you when they breakup. They will call you and invite you out and leave you hanging when they pick up some other guy. They will ignore you while they are happy with this other bloke, only to call you when they are in pieces again. You'll put them together again and they will ignore you again. again and again. If this is what you want, read this book.  On the other hand, if you want to be the bloke they actually fall for, sleep with and marry, do exactly the opposite of what this book suggests 
 No, Todd, I won't be buying the set. The music being absent is a big part, but from what everyone says about the picture quality there is no way I'm paying $30 for that. I will rent them first and MAYBE I'll find one used for cheap someday. Blame the greedy record companies for the music issues, blame Paramount for the video issues 
 The book was very dull it had better use as a textbook than a pleasure-reading book. Trying to connect to the characters would be like trying to teach an ameba to roll over, no character was given enough screen-time, or page-time to be correct, to get to know them. The book started telling how Elizabeth's story, which influenced modern Cinderella stories, then you suddenly are reading about how many people believe in witches today, after that about how Marther helped a family in need, ect... After awhile you begun to think, "Who is the main character!!!!' I would suggest this book to no one it is the worst book I have ever read. All in all if you want to read a good book don't read this one 
 Robert Johnson was one of the most enigmatic bluesmen of the 20th century and his life is still a mystery today.Fans only have two grainy pictures of Johnson and various accounts of the mans' life by those who knew him and those who purport to have known him.Having died at the age of 27 by poisoning only adds to the legacy.Johnson, like many of his contemporaries in that early century era, liked women and whiskey and that became his undoing...a jealous husband poisoned his drink and sent Johnson off into the history books forever.In this documentary, other bluesmen will tell you what Johnson was all about, right up to those final hours but some of their testimony is questionable, as was Johnsons' entire life.But the music is there and it lives up to the Johnson image. Many songs are haunting (Hellhound on My Trail, Come On In My Kitchen) and many are sad (Drunkenhearted Man,From Four Til Late)but they all carry Johnsons'unique stamp on the blues. One listen and you'll hear it.Danny Glover's narration is compassionate and blues musician Keb Mos' silhouetted figure makes you feel that you are watching actual footage of Johnson himself. Good stuff.. 
 This is Rehash of the first edition - same boring material regurgitated back at you. It's like taking ugly red-headed step-child and trying to dye his hair black but the roots and the freckles show through the disguise - still ugly and red-headed - like this book. This author can't take any critisism - don't worry - he'll cry like a little baby to amazon offical and this will get taken down. I try to warn you that this book won't be loved to dog ears - it sit on shelf and become dust bunny catcher because the circuits are wrongness and the most don't go well 
 What a disappointment this is, after the superb Pitt and Monk detective novels set in Victorian times.  Someone at the publishing house should have had the courage to point out some problems to the writer:  (1) She repeats information not once but many times, apparently having forgotten that she had already said that; (2) The plot and denouement are not likely and are hard to follow.  For example, the police supposedly look everywhere for the gun that killed Sebastian, and eventually it is deduced that the one place they didn't look was in the drain funnel on the roof of the master's abode.  And lo, there it was, wrapped in a cloth and stuck, barrel down.  To prove(?) that it was the fatal gun, the cistern barrel for that downpipe is dry.  What?  Say that again?  In short, the characters, the dialogue, the atmosphere just don't measure up to the plunges the reader takes into the drawing rooms and rookeries of London, circa 1880+.  Rather than go into this series, the reader would do well to go back and read the Victorian books.  That's a sorry suggestion, and I'm sorry to have to make it. 
 Well it's Dershowitz at his best, concise and to the point.  Obviously Israel can never do anything wrong.  Of course they have never acted savagely over the past 100 years.  Clearly they are the perpetual victims of all the 7 billion anti-Semites that populate the planet.  And of course the damn Arabs are a bunch of oppressive, backward maniacs that just enjoy spilling innocent Israeli blood, with no good reason and simply because they are sick.  The reason the Israeli to Arab casualty ratio in the past 70-80 years has been an approximate 1:10 is because there is no such thing as an Arab civilian, and they are all legitimate target practice for Israeli trigger-happy teenage conscripts (especially those pesky little Arab kids, since they are more difficult, hence more fun to shoot).  Just ignore their grievances, since they are really sub-human if you get down to the basic facts and cut the non-sense.  Here goes; I just summarized the whole essay.  But you have to read the real thing to appreciate the sick humor.  Enjoy 
         I have to admit that I found this book very entertaining and I really enjoyed reading it.  But, I cannot in good mind and logic believe the theory that this book puts forth.  It just makes no logical sense that a planet of the size Sitchin describes can come as close to Earth as he says without totally throwing us off orbit.  I also can't believe that the "Nephilim" are so similar to us and yet from a world that must be completely different.  Yes, I realize that Sitchin says that the Nephilim created us and that is why we are alike.  Yet the Theory of Evolution makes it clear that humans are designed for life on Earth, Homo sapiens sapiens is suited for life on this world.  If the Nephilim evolved on a whole different world with a whole different environment, they shouldn't look even remotely like us.  Or remotely like the apes Sitchin says the Nephilim found on Earth and used to create us.        As history, this book gets zero stars, but I gave it two because it really was a fun read.  I actually would recommend it to my friends, but only as fiction. 
 I was very happy to here that Warner Home Video are releasing these films of faith. But I have to query the transfer quality. I dont know is it me we are talking DVD quality right but it look Like The transfer is from a video (The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima VHS Video Transfer on To DVD for sure  also The Films Nior Has any one seen The Longest Day? For Sure VHS to DVD all I am saying is if that's the case why not go out and get your self a video to DVD recorder and do The same righ 
 There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh! 
 This book should be sub-titled "My Thoughts on Stuff I Downloaded from Microsoft." The examples were pulled down from MSDN and were just his comments on those examples. I expected some original material but it was non-existent. I suppose if you haven't seen the online examples this book might be fascinating. Because Atlas is early in its lifecycle I was hoping that this book would contain more documentation than what is available online. It fell short of my expectations 
 This book is vey difficult to understand and learn from.  It's explanations are too abbreviated with not enough information on each code.  Also, not all codes and conventions are included, and it reads like a novel, meaning not very descriptive or illustrative.  Too many paragraphs and sentences 
 The DVD for "Fascination" has a great cover and makes you think this will be a romantic film set in exotic locations.  There really was only one beach location, which probably helped cut down on the budget.  Klaus Menzel's direction lends a sputtering pace and made me feel the picture was going downhill as it changed from romance to attempted thriller.  James Naughton from 1974's "The Paper Chase," "First Wives Club" & "Devil Wears Prada" plays the father whose swimming accident casts an early shadow over the film.  Adam Garcia plays his son Scott.  Garcia has been in a number of films including "Bootmen," "Coyote Ugly" & "Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen."  However, I didn't quite remember him, nor would his rather wooden self-absorbed performance and his flat vocal affectation be likely to make me recall him from this film.  However, he does a good job in the bare bottom love scenes.  Scott's mother is lovely Jacqueline Bisset who has had a long career since she first claimed fame as Giovanni Goodthighs in "Casino Royale" back in 1967 and went on to work with Francois Truffaut in "Day for Night."  She has 4 Golden Globe nominations with the most recent being in 1999 for "Joan of Arc."  She does a good job as the mother Maureen who has an affair that turns into her second husband.  Unfortunately, her taste in men does not improve as husband #2 appears to be on a revenge mission for husband #1 who let husband #2's wife #1 drown -- in short, the plot is a bit contrived and confusing with more twists and turns than common sense.  Husband #2 is Oliver Vance played by Stuart Wilson from "The Prisoner of Zenda," "Wild Things," "Lethal Weapon 3" & "Enemy of the State."  As the bad guy, he is overbearing and a bit revolting.  His intimacy with his adopted daughter turns him into a real sleaze merchant.  His adopted daughter Kelly has the most confusing of roles, confusingly written, although actress Alice Evans does as good of a job as possible with this.  Why a girl who survived the streets of Johannesburg decides to try to jump out of a car at the end of the movie didn't make sense to me.  Such was the bundle of contradictions of this character.  How could she allow herself to be used by her stepfather?  Why would she still feel allegiance to him?  The only real answer is the screenwriter wanted her in the movie; and that's how she arrived.  Evans has worked in "National Lampoon's Blackball," "My Wife Maurice" & "102 Dalmatians."  This role will hardly catapult her onto Hollywood's "A" list.  The actors bravely stick with this turkey that does have some nice love scenes & one tropical location.  Otherwise, you'll be wondering how much longer until it's over.  The alternate ending apparently had Garcia dead; so I'm glad they picked the ending they did.  Taxi!   
 This would have been an interesting and original view of the problem of persistent poverty in the U.S. had it been published, oh, about thirty or thirty-five years ago.  As it is, it grossly oversimplifies a complex problem, and worse, plays to the cherished superstitions of neoconservative intellectuals and their `lumpen' readers alike.  It will probably come as a great surprise to the author, but I doubt poor black, Hispanic, and hell, even poor white kids have ever even heard of Norman Mailer, much less studied his essays in school.  It may also have escaped the author's attention that inflation whittled the value of payments from programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children down to a fraction of 1960's levels, even factoring in occasional cost-of-living increases-which had all but ceased starting in the 1980's.  Finally, under the impetus of a conservative Congress, the Clinton administration undertook reform of "welfare" in 1996 which included drastically tightening eligibility requirements, placing strict time limits on receipt of benefits, and actively directing recipients into jobs.  Yet poverty seems to persist despite the implementation of conservative nostrums and even more amazingly, despite a near-full employment economy at the end of the 1990's.  In other words, trying to blame everything on kids who grew their hair long in the 1960's, and vapid socialites hobnobbing with Bobby Seale at Leonard Bernstein's soirees forty years ago is not only not right-it isn't even wrong    Meanwhile, since the Nixon administration we have conducted a "War on Drugs" that has stuffed prisons full to bursting with (mostly low level) drug dealers and users-nearly all of them minorities--but accomplished very little else. Although crime rates have in fact dropped to historically low levels, this seems to have little if any correlation with incarceration rates, which have been relentlessly rising since the 1970's.  This decrease in crime, by the way, confounded neoconservative predictions at the beginning of the 1990's that crime-allegedly inspired by our evil culture-would continue spiraling upwards without letup.  Similar decreases occurred in out-of-wedlock births, but as an old saying goes, "A lady's reputation seldom improves."  Especially when she is a member of a racial minority, I might add.  It would seem that the underclass owes very little to the 1960's counterculture, although Encounter Books-once a source of urbane and intelligent works-would probably not have taken Mr. Magnet's manuscript had he concluded as much.  Neoconservatives, it turns out, are as rigidly locked into a mindless party line as the 1960's leftists they criticize.  For example, black social scientists such as Glen Loury and William Julius Wilson were clutched to neoconservative bosoms when their research found that blacks suffered relatively little racial discrimination in hiring compared to past decades.  They were dropped like hot potatoes however when their continued investigations showed that minority unemployment had a lot more to do with factors such as the virtual disappearance of even low-skilled work from most urban areas, and the lack of transportation to exurban areas where most job growth was.  Kind of makes blaming the 1969 Woodstock festival look silly, to say the least.  There is no doubt that there is something that was once called "the culture of poverty" that inculcates some of the poor with self-defeating attitudes and behaviors.  This was already old hat by the time "London Labor and London Poor" was published during the Victorian age.  Presumably, the Victorian poor did not become or remain so because of Janet Jackson displaying her bosom on television a century later.  There are innumerable other criticisms to be made of this book starting with its confusion of drug-taking behavior among the poor (which tends to seek oblivion from hopelessness) with middle-class drug taking behavior (which is usually risk-seeking or thrill-seeking), but a complete enumeration of its mistakes, misconceptions, and half-truths would take an essay nearly as long as the book itself.  Suffice it to say that instead of being random, the errors all seem to point in a certain political direction.  Readers may conclude what they will about the author's presumed good faith from this.  Those looking for `just-so-stories' to confirm their darkest prejudices towards racial minorities and justify doing nothing will certainly find what they seek in this book.  Those looking for nuanced discussions aimed at trying to solve problems instead of finding scapegoats will have to look elsewhere 
 of every band/group, there is always the weak link, Tony Yayo proves that he is the one with Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon.  Many of the songs are not produced by Dr. Dre (one of the few things that G-Unit has going for them) resulting in "greasy" and bad beats.  Tony Yayo cant seem to trun his mouth away from drug trafficing, being locked up in prison, hoes, ect.  He lyrics aren't all that great either, making him have the worst voice in G-unit as well.  He sounds almost as if he is my grandfather- maybe as a result of getting locked up.  The few pluses on the album are "Drama Setter" feat. Eminem and Obie Trice followed by Eminem's constant adreniline rushing sound and beats (even though he only is apart of the chorus-a big mistake) as well as "G-S**t".  My advice, download these two songs- this CD isn't worth $14.00 
 This film is so stupid that when different locations in Quebec are shown the captions read "St. Jovite, Canada" or Montreal, Canada" like mentioning Quebec would be too complicated for the retarded masses this film is intended for.  Angelina Jolie plays her smug little self with pitiful dialogue as usual lately. But I will say that I am happy that she went to see an Expos game while in Montreal... and that she shows us some skin here.  The kid at the begining of the film who plays the killer is SO ANNOYING!!!  Someone needs to steal his John Lennon glasses and kick his ass before he ruins yet another film. One bonus in here is that Marie-Jose Croze is in it albeit briefly.  She should have been the lead.  She's hotter than Angelina and a better actress (see Munich). This film is also beneath Jean-Hugues Anglade who plays a detective and can act circles aroun Ethan Hawke any day of the week 
 The CD came without a CD case and the CD did not play.  I am very disappointed 
 This book is offensive to at least one of the two genders, though it's hard to say which. It suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot, more or less. Whether that's more insulting to the male brain or the female body, I'm not sure, but the book portrays neither gender realistically.  I like Heinlein, and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential, but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass, and it's not even particularly good at being that.  The gender-swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so, but Heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo-enlightened erotica instead of literature. More's the pity 
 Don't get me wrong.  I like Stephen Hunter's work. However, with Pale Horse Coming, he achieved something that almost no other writer ever has.  He put me to sleep.  I actually could not finish this book . . . and I tried . . . I really did.  The first half of the book isn't bad.  It basically chronicles the suffering of Hunter's main character Earl as he copes with being trapped in a brutal Southern prison farm. This section of the book features one of the most innovative suspense sequences I have ever read: Earl is trussed up, weighted and tossed overboard. As he sinks, he realizes that he is among a forest of murdered corpses that have met the same end.  Great, right?  However, after Earl's escape, everything goes south (pun intended).  Earl escapes . . . I won't blow the means.  Then he decides to go back the the prison farm and clean house.  In an agonizingly boring and extended sequence, Earl recruits a bunch of aging sharpshooters to assist him.  They include a guy named Audie who is, yes you guessed it, an Audie Murphy clone.  The aged Wild Bunch also includes a guy in his 80's confined to a wheel chair.  The interminable mini-bios of these guys are pure agony.  If you want to read Hunter at his best, run as far as you can from Pale Horse Coming.  Give one of his other Sniper classics a try . . . or treat yourself to Dirty White Boys.  That book really rocks 
 I think that that is exactly what Neiderman had running through his mind when he wrote this series and book.  I have always loved Andrews and Neiderman's work. (I even ran a very popular VCA site) Heck I even liked one of the miniseries (the Orphans series). But ever since the DeBeers series I have liked the books less and less. And I don't think it has anything to do with the fact that I read books that are truly shocking now because I still get that wonderful "OMG" feeling when I re-read the early books of both Andrews and Neiderman. I remained optimistic with the wildflowers and shooting stars series even though I could not stand them. Then he lost me with the De Beers series (with the exception of Willow because I could dort of understand her and where she was coming from, in the first book anyway), and even more so with this last series. The Gemini series has had to have been the worst series of books I have ever read. And it's too bad because it could have been so wonderful. I love weird and freaky stories. And let's face it, a girl being forced to live as a boy is pretty twisted and freaky. But Neiderman dropped the ball. The entire story was boring. It barely held my interest but I was determined to try and get through it (mainly because I was hoping I hadn't wasted $7 on a book). Then came the ending and it was so obvious that he was desperately trying to come up with the most shocking thing ever just to keep people interested. Instead, I believe it had the opposite effect.  I'll still be reading April Showers, but (and I hate to say it) if it's as bad as De Beers and Gemini, I highly doubt that I will ever purchase another "V.C. Andrews" novel, and it so pains me to say that 
 Gerald Locklin has the dubious distinction of writing the first "book" on Bukowski after his death. The whole book reads like a quickie for profit job. In fact most of it was written while Buk was alive.  There are letters and attempts at poetry by this "hack professor"  mascrading as Buk's close friend. Don't waste your $25.00 on this book.  Instead buy Gay Brewer's (also an academic) book on Bukowski which is by  far the best book written on the subject so far (June 2000) 
 The author missed the point of a quiet life which is that you just do it and enjoy it --- you don't call your friends to do it with you and stop when they cancel.  Another reviewer of Bender's work said that she in "in her head too much" and I completely agree. Stop thinking SO much - just enjoy life - your family. Stop making lists. Stop degrading yourself for the simple process of taking care of yourself, your family and your house. 
 I have bought three books from Writer's Digest Books that explicitly introduces and teaches you to the world of writing greeting cards.  The 1980 is old but has good tried and true concepts.  The 1992 "How to Write and Sell Greeting Cards" by Molly Wigand which is fun to read, a super reference, lot's of applications and worksheets. (the best of the three by far) And this book that I'm reviewing is the latest, 1998, but not the greatest.  I find it very hard to look up for things, not my reference book. The index is just one page long, so when looking for different occasions to write about, it takes too long and the help is not great.  The book just introduces to the greeting card world, teaches a little about writing styles and 9 pages about the industry... period.  Not much about writing for b-days, Xmas, Mother's day, etc.  No workbooks, no good brainstorming advice.  I couldn't find the writer helping me out organizing my ideas, developing them, archiving them. I'll have to read the book from cover to cover to just find one thing.  On the other hand, the "How to write & sell greeting cards, bumper stickers, t-shirts and other fun stuff" by Molly Wingand is a marvelous book I enjoy having, referring and learning from 
 I bought this book based on the recommendations here; unfortunately I have to say it's been a disappointment, and I feel compelled to write my own review too. While the book is obviously well researched and rich in details, the author interferes too much in the narrative -- I am frankly not very interested in Nicholas Thomas' personal relationship with Cook and Australian history. He claims in the introduction that he wants to stay away from the hero and anti-hero biases, but the whole book is very judgmental of Cook and his crew. In trying to be politically correct in 21st-century terms, the author fails to capture the 18th-century spirit of the voyages. Indeed, he paints a dark, boring picture of Cook that doesn't coincide with the exciting contemporary reception the navigator had in the second half of the 18th century. The style is poor, with long, convoluted sentences that take re-reading to decypher. Most annoyingly, there are several typos of foreign words, which I find unacceptable for a book published by a major publisher -- it shows a lack of attention to detail. I wish I could recommend another Cook biography, but I simply don't know. I can, however, highly praise Diana Preston's newly published biography of William Dampier, _A Pirate of Exquisite Mind_ for those interested in European navigators 
 The subjects covered were helpful, but lacking in detail for one who is looking for expert guidance. I look for an author to get right to the point and explain things as an expert insider would guide the protege'. The author doesn't go much deeper than explaining the obvious, like advising the reader to find out if buyers prefer to review portfolois on CD's, prints, or transparencies. Many points the author makes raise questions rather than providing answers 
 I'm surprised that no-one has commented on the overly complicated knitting/purling method used in this book.    The book shows only one way to make a knit/purl stitch, and it's slow and torturous.  You insert the right needle into the stitch as you normally would when knitting or purling, but then you hold the point where the needles intersect, pick up the working yarn with your free hand and wind it around the needle.  Then you pick up both needles again and complete the stitch as usual.  This method would frustrate any child, enough to get them to stop knitting altogether 
 but this one I had no trouble parting with.  I purchased this book shortly after it was released, long before General Clark made his bid for the Democratic nomination.  I've tried to complete it twice, but cannot bear to finish it.   It's just too much celebration of General Clark and not enough discussion of events in  his life or the the context of those events.  It's a dissapointment , because General Clark is obviously intelligent, and has the resume to provide an interesting read 
 I feel sorry for author. Dennis Welt BC Canad 
 The book covered some of the real-time technology that TIBCO and other IT firms developed.  But it is outdated.  The environment now in year 2003 is very different 
 Bought this because the game manual was useless. There is so much NOT covered in either the manual or this guide that you are going to have to work the fan sites to find out how to work the finer points of the game.  Leave this guide on the shelf 
 I normally like warm, sensual-type perfumes, but I wanted to try something different for a change.  I liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey.  Well...I have to disagree.  I think it is VERY perfumey and not subtle at all. To me it has a very sharp, high-toned scent which is almost acrid. I thought at first that maybe I had sprayed too much on, so I tried just a little spritz.  Still VERY strong and sharp. And I agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets.  I will definitely not be ordering this again.  
 Take a step back from your revulsion (a healthy human reaction, so I do hope you were revolted...) to the detailed ritualistic torture of animals and children found in Hard Truth, and analyze the character development and plot development of the last 3 or 4 Anna Pigeon books.  Anna Pigeon as a person is fast becoming a 1-dimensional charicature of the person we met in the first few books; at the same time the author is digging a Natchez Trace of a rut in plot progression - repackaging over again the crazed killer whose insanity is able to drive him through repeated injury to keep after Anna page after page after page. It's as if an editor has said "the stylized nightmare is hot in the industry these days, so rewrite most of the story to be the 'bogeyman' chasing the heroine who just runs and runs and runs."  I can only hope it's an editor saying that, and not a personal problem of the author's.   If one separated the pages of character development from the pages of "insanity-driven bogeyman keeps coming toward Anna" in any recent Nevada Barr book, would there be much more than a short story 
 I find it fascinating that publishers aren't catching on that nutritionists don't make food that's in the ballpark of chefs.  If you want a healthy cookbook, buy one from a trained chef who specialized in healthy food.  This is a perfect example.  Good idea, terrible execution (meaning the finished dishes leave much to be desired). 
 The problem with the Supreme Court is the same problem with virtually every U.S. institution, it is being coopted by corporate interests.  The watershed decision that started this process was the 1886 case of Santa Clara Country vs. the Southern Pacific Railroad, in which corporations were granted "personhood."  Since that time, the Fourteenth Amendment, among others, has been perverted by corporate lawyers to extend additional rights to Big Business, and we the people have been losing the legal structure to control these private tyrannies.  Founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson warned of this growing menace when he said, "I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our monied corporations which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the laws of our country."  And President Grover Cleveland warned in 1888 that, "As we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the existence of trusts, combinations, and monopolies, while the citizen is struggling far in the rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel.  Corporations, which should be the carefully restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters." A much more interesting book on Constitutional matters is Thom Hartmann's "Unequal Protection: The Rise of Corporate Dominance and the Theft of Human Rights."  Hartmann also hosts a daily radio program that inspires the most thought provoking dialogue in radio.  I can't say the same for Levin's book or his show. In fact, I think Levin is consciously avoiding the more profound issues that people like Hartmann raise.  These more pressing issues are also raised in the award-winning documentary "The Corporation" - which is available on Amazon in DVD format. 
 this is the worst scarface record to date weak beats,the homies suck.what happened to the original homies from the old rap-a-lot days.get the first my homies but dont buy this crap 
 Literary critic should have titled this little guide `What to Read and Why,' seeing as he devotes only a few paragraphs to why reading might be valuable. That said, Bloom is a terrifyingly accomplished reader, but he isn't much of a thinker or a critic in the way Benjamin or Derrida were. Bloom's incessant propensity to judge all literature from the `how is this compared to Shakespeare' lens is foolish and lacking in any insight. At times his criticism seems almost amateurish and rushed. He doesn't seem to be a very good reader of Hemingway, for instance. At the outset of a review of `Hills Like White Elephants,' Bloom writes that "Hemingway's personal mystique-his bravura poses as warrior, big-game hunter, bullfighter, and boxer-is irrelevant to `Hills Like White Elephants' as its male protagonist's insistence that `You know that I love you'" (47). Yet later in Bloom's review, he writes [on `The Snows of Kilimanjaro']: The irony is at Hemingway's expense, insofar as Harry prophesies the Hemingway who, nineteen days shor of his sixty-second birthday, turned a double-barreled shotgun on himself" (49). Bloom seems to have reversed tactics here. Never the less, Bloom is an undeniably great reader of poetry; in this volume he tells you all about his personal favorites: Stevens, Whitman, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, etc. Kind of fun, but far from great criticism.  
 I appreciate and like Johnny Lang's music.  There is no doubt that he is amazing.  However, this CD is awful.  It does not demonstrate his true abilites and should have the "kid" still in the title.  The CD is good if you want to complete your collection, but this CD is not one worth listening to twice.  Save your money and wait for his next CD release 
 I was disappointed with this book.  Yes, it does have lots of reward ideas (I tried counting them but only got to around half of the advertised 1001 ideas).  What really disappointed me, however, was that most of them required a fairly large expenditure.  I work for a small company (under 100 employees) and in a tight economic environment, we just don't have the funds to be sending people to Hawaii or some of the other *big* rewards in this book.  I needed something that recommended inexpensive reward options.  This book was not it.  (I did find another one listed on Amazon that advertises it has "101 ways to reward team members for $20 or less" -- I think that might suit me better.  I'm going to buy that one next and see if it suits my situation any better. 
 I purchased this book because the subject matter sounded interesting. It was poorly written, badly researched, and very disappointing. I am not sure what book the other reviewers read but 1 star seemed excessive. A well written, adequately researched book on the subject would be fascinating. Don't waste your hard earned money on this puerile fluff 
 Disappointing. I'd expect much more from a book that is a "developers guide". For example, the programs have to be typed in, there is no cd or website! The explanations were too brief and skim over topics. Keep looking if you are in need of a good j2me book 
 Colorless and high priced, though I bought it at the book store for 88.00.  Sections are laid out poorly, but key words and ideas a pre-highlighted. About the same information given in any material science book, just  different layout 
 This book is not for the modern mom:  the mom who plays with her children, looks for the best schools for them, tries to prevent them from injuring themselves, and actually takes photos of them.  Muffy proudly denounces all of these practices.    This book was annoying.  Her "slacker" approach to parenting amounts to nothing more than being emotionally and physically distant from her children.    She is not a huggy-snuggly-sentimental mommy.  Her rational is that her mother parented her with a hands-off appoach and she turned out fine.  However, the reason her parents were as such is because they worked on a cattle ranch 7 days a week!  Why do I get the feeling that Little-Girl-Muffy didn't especially appreciate her parents working every single day, leaving her to play in the dirt with cattle hands as a small child?  There are deeper wounds lying beneath the prose of this book.  However, she refuses to acknowledge them and comes across as condesending to any of us parent differently from her or her mother (which, thankfully, is most of us).  Her children are far to young, her parenting experience barely begun, for her to write a book as smug as this.    If you are sensitive to the use of the English language, the numerous incomplete sentences that pepper this book will bother you.       
 Since the end of the Cold War, writers and political commentators have suggested that we have entered a new war - a war brought on by the "clash of civilizations". The theory, as told by writers such as Samuel Huntington and Bernard Lewis, amongst others, suggests that "the west" is at war with Islam and that this global divide will replace the earlier Cold War acrimony. Not for any particular reason or circumstance is this war being waged against us, they suggest, but merely because of its violent nature and hatred of western civilization. It is the very essence of Islam, a religion that does not share core values with ours which is the problem, and the only way to contain its violence is to be merciless in our efforts to do so.     Aside from this rhetoric being advocated as "fact" by news organizations such as FOX cable news, CNN, and most newspapers, this thesis has been regularly used by the powerful to justify wars. The U.S. used it to justify the war with Iraq and Afghanistan; Serbs and Croatians used it to justify ethnic cleansing of Bosnian and Kosovar Muslims; and it is used by Israel to justify their "war" with Palestinians.    The Clash of Civilization rhetoric suggests that the world will always be at war. As opposed to the Cold War with the Soviet Union (a country only in existence for less than a century), Islam is an old religion spread  throughout the world. The framework of the Cold war between the Communist "east" and the capitalist "west" did prove useful in making this theory. The new war is between the rational, democratic, secular, and tolerant "west" and the irrational, fundamentalist, and violent "east". Orwell could have predicted this well: the new enemy created on the morning after the old enemies fell. It almost seems that for the "west"  to feel at home with itself, it needs to be at constant war with some "other". Perhaps it provides some guidance to what we are and what we are not - we are simply not the "other". Perhaps Chomsky and others who have suggested that a major reason that states fight wars is for domestic reasons and for the disciplining of a nation's own population are right.     Not according to the "clash theorists" like Bernard Lewis, who claim that the clash will continue as long as Islam exists. He believes that the radical Islamic militants are not deviants from Islam, but actually have a more correct view of it. They will therefore likely become more influential over the years. But if such a clash really existed, why then do western nations continue to support both financially and militarily such Islamic groups and nations? As Eqbal Amad noted, the U.S. has long supported this very enemy, be it with Iraq (during and after the Iraq-Iran wars), the Saudi Monarchy, or the Afghani Mujahadeen.     Perhaps this theory falls within the entire framework of colonialism. Western colonial nations conquered the world and forced its non-western inhabitants to submit to their authority. It was believed and advocated that colonialism would help these "backward" people in the long run to become just like the colonists. Beyond the arrogance of the idea, colonialism developed sophisticated systems of slavery and servitude that sought to extract valuable natural resources from these areas for the sole benefit of their the colonizers own nations.     Interestingly anti-western Islamic militants use the same kind of "absolute conflict" to frame their war with the West. They say the conflict is between the hedonistic, degenerate, repressive, soulless West and the just, truthful, and moral center of Islam. Speaking to this subject, writers Qureshi and Sells note:     "Those who proclaim such a clash of civilizations, speaking for the West or for Islam, exhibit the characteristics of fundamentalism: the assumption of a static essence, knowable immediately, of each civilization, the ability to ignore history and tradition, and the desire to lead the ideological battle on behalf of one of the clashing civilizations". 
 Near Dark has to go down as one of a THE worst horror movies of the 80s. Simply put, this movie is so slow and drawn out that I wanted one of the vampires, preferabley May, to jump out of my television and bite me in the jugular just to get it over with. However, since that wasn't going to happen, the next best thing for me was to use the chapter jump button on my remote, which I used many times after the first hour.  Rumor has it that Hollywood wants to do a remake of this dung flick! What are they thinking in tinseltown--I mean really.  Well, as the ol' saying goes: "you've been warned."  Thank you 
 I suppose it only made sense, after reading the previous two books, for Baxter to have wound up here. I mean, after Exultant, what was really left? I was hoping he would have tied things together, and continued the story. Instead, we fast forward from "now" to 500,000 years from now (whereas Exultant was 25,000 years from today, and coalescent was -1,500 years from today). Like the other two books, we have two plot threads. The nearer takes place in the near term future, in a somewhat contrived description of a pre-global-warming-apocalypse earth, with Yet Another Damn Poole taking the lead role (a bit like his Reid Malenfant in the Manifold series, which I grew to detest).  The other thread is what most irritated me. While I appreciated his grand tour of the possibilities of human evolution, I was put off by his wide-eyed speculation and what-if's. Many of the things he describes are fundamentally plausible, in the way that drag racing possibilities can be speculated on paper. But they ring hollow. Sure, you can described silicon-based life, but is it plausible? And the humans-made-dolphins (again, from Manifold) show up again, being equally silly this time around.  But, that's not really the worst of the book. Towards the end, the book lapses into navel-gazing, much in the way Hideaki Anno's Neon Genesis Evangelion does in the later part of the series. Sadly, it's just as hard to wrap your head around. The philosophical meandering doesn't make much sense, and seems to have very little to do with the previous books, or indeed the rest of the Xeelee Sequence. Certainly it's a departure from Ring, which was frankly an impressive epic set in the same sequence. But, really, what choice did he have by setting the environment half a million years from now?  The "contemporary" thread (set in the 2050's) is... "interesting," but also seems to borrow from the Malenfant stick figure he has developed elsewhere (and indeed the Peter character from Coalescent re-appears in this book with a different name, but the same physical description, neuroses, and agenda), as well as the notions in John Brunner's The Sheep Look Up. Sure, it made sense in Brunner's take on things, but we've _read_ that already. There's no sense in an educated engineer getting all misty eyed about global warming in a book set half a million years in the future.  So, sadly, the last book (although a fourth book, with short stories from the rest of the Coalescent books, has just been published) finishes the series by wobbling between "why am I reading this" and "this is just entirely silly."  Exultant is worth a read, but could probably be thrown into the Xeelee Sequence and read alongside Ring. Coalescent and Transcendant, I could do without 
 The best parts of this film were the minute-long landscape shots, free of dialog and narrative.  At those points you could almost forget the absolute dullness of every character and plot aspect. Contrary to the gushing of the majority, this is not even a love story so much as it is a celebration of selfishness and treating others poorly.  Don't let the WWII period piece propaganda fool you on this.  Granted, I turned it off after 1.5 hours out of sheer dread and boredom, so maybe this flaming sack of doo redeemed itself in the last hour.  
 The monster was pretty fake. The jokes were corny. The special effects...were there any? The underwater shots were grainy. At times, it was over-acted. This movie was so-so. It won't scare you. The Alien series or The Cave are much better. This movie may have been okay in its day, but times have changed...and movie making have improved a lot...a whole lot. Skip this flick 
   Welcome to the book with no point. This book is not clever, funny or consistent. The drawing style is ripped off from Ralph Steadman. If you are a fan of Bigfoot, do not buy this book 
 For $20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking/jogging, with a bonus pedometer.  The radio has no channel display, and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial, then a scan button.  When walking, it loses the station occasionally - luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial, but if yours isn't this could be terribly annoying.  As for the pedometer, it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband, and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when I was holding it perfectly still - thus worthless.  I'm sending it back 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 This book is full of excellent information with tools and methodologies for future systems analyst work BUT the information is so abstract.  There are no real practical examples in any of the chapters which would make it easier for me to grasp it (not to mention help with the assigned homework).  Unlike most college subjects and textbooks that have three or more examples at the beginning of a chapter, this book has little if any at all 
 Mr. West writes about the Vatican not about the Roman Catholic Church. If he had not been a priest i would  have understand some of his descriptions  about Catholic Church. Since he has enouph information on the subject it  seems he wants to "reprove" some of the Church's institutions by  providing information he knows not beeing totaly correct. Saying half a  true it is the better way to say a lie Maria Santo 
 I had to use this book for my database management class at Sac State. Only one word can describe this book: horrid. This is the first time I was afraid of failing a class and I beleive that this book had a lot to do with it. It was too difficult to follow and I found myself frustrated and sleepy at the same time. There is just too much information and the examples are not helpful at all. For our final project we had to create SQL statements to query the tables in our Oracle database and during the 12 hours I spent yesterday trying to finish not once was this text helpful. I tried to sell it back too, but apparently no one wants it. Just as well I guess since I might need it again next semester (assuming I don't pass that is). : 
 As a teacher of mythology, I was delighted when I first discovered this  book. Reading it, however, was a disappointment. The author's embittered  tirad against men quickly wears thin and leaves you longing for a more  accurate and less obviously distorted exploration of this important  subject. While the author is to be commended for drawing our attention to  the crone's vital role in society, I hope this book will inspire a feminist  with less of an ax to grind to write a more accurate and psychologically  profound account of the crone 
 This is a great book for people aspiring to become a professional gunsmith.  It may have some usefulness for the normal gun owner as well.  The detail and comments provided show this book was written by someone with an extreme amount of knowledge and experience in the subject.  Unfortunately the author realizes this and wrote this book to reflect it.  His egotistical lectures of exactly what the reader should do go beyond what I expected to gain from this book.  Then there are the contradictions that lead me to not believe in the author's knowledge as much as I did when I started.   If you want a very technical guide on how to become a professional gunsmith, this is the book for you.  If you want a Do-It-Yourself Gun Repair Manual (Gunsmithing at Home) look elsewhere. 
 I was completely mezmorized by the first quarter of the book. Even though Anne Patchett is writing as a white woman, her characterizations of John, the black male ex-drummer and bar manager, and of the other bar employees ring true. The little details in the relationships between the characters, their idiosynchrocies and habits, are intriguing. The theme of loyalty and love surrounding John's longing for his son is equally compelling. BUT - when we get to the heart of the story, where John is pulled into alove-lust relationship with Fay, my stomach had a sinking "oh-no" feeling. And this instant reaction was correct. This plot line was flat and unbelievable, even repellant. So, too, are issues with Carl, Fay's drug-dealing brother. Anne Patchett is an incredibly talented author. I highly enourage you to read Bel Canto or The Magician's Assistnat instead. 
 There is a common assumption, particularly among the musical literati, that if a piece is novel, obscure, extremely simple, unchromatic or simply weird, it must, by definition, be quality material. Sheer novelty trumps quality. I am reminded of having to hunker down at the Symphony as the conductor launches into an extended "explanation" on why this next piece may not have a melody, discernable beat, nor employ "ordinary" instruments, yet is still a fine piece of art.  (Chances are the majority of comments will be along the lines of, "What in the world was that thing with bongo drums & basketballs?"   I am the first to admit the artistry, perhaps musicality of Cage even when he takes himself AND his music too seriously.  At least we did not have to "listen" to 4'33". One reviewer was correct - this is perhaps the most accessible offering of the entire ouevre. It is...interesting in a childish sort of way, sort of like someone who learns that hitting notes on a keyboard results in sounds or better, is playing just to hear the sounds that can be produced. DREAM perfectly expresses the mood of this CD (which is wonderful as party backgroup music) with its enigmatic, almost shy explorations. The tracks are united by an almost wordless fear of being closely examined. A few contain a nice rhythmic drive, others remind one of that godawful New Age stuff heard on public radio occasionally. The CD is compelling only if one takes their music with a huge dollop of tenuousness 
 I was very disappointed in this volume.  There is little real data here or in-depth illustrations.  You are much better off getting some of the books indicated in the bibliography, though I'm surprised it does not mention 'Sunburst' by Mark Peattie, the Japanese Naval Air Arm companion to 'Kaigun' by Evans and Peattie.  You would be much better off just going to the combinedfleet.com website and printing up the unit histories and operational descriptions.  A number of Japanese sources that are readily available have much more detail.  Perhaps it would have been better to just translate them into English.  Unfortunately, a poor effort 
 Very poorly written...don't waste your $$.  Very little  receipes and more of encyclopedia explanations on nutrician.  Disappointing 
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 Standard Heinlein Disclaimer: Heinlein is a frequently-polarizing figure in American literature. The people who dislike his work (e.g., A. Panshin) seem to *really* dislike his work, and often for reasons that seem to me spurious. The people who like his work are in many cases blind or too forgiving of Heinlein's problems as a writer. I like Heinlein's work quite a bit, and find all but two of his novels consistently enjoyable, but I would not rate any but one or possibly two of his books as being the "best of the SF genre." They are for me, however, always enjoyable, and that is no small thing to find in an author.   And as you may have guessed, this is one of the two.  (The other is "Rocketship Galileo" which, in my opinion, only suffers from the mistakes of a person new to writing novels, and a hoary "Nazis on the Moon!" plotline that, to put it mildly, has not worn well with time.)  The story behind this book is, apparently, that Heinlein was ill as he was finishing it, and it was published without the traditional editing cycle that he usually employed.  Could be.  Frankly, it's hard for me to imagine editing making this novel more readable.  This is a relatively interesting idea (a man's brain transplanted into a woman's body), but as many others have pointed out, the execution is poor.  Frankly, there's not much story here at all, aside from a man exploring what it's like being in a woman's body.  But the exploration is by turns dull and absurd.  Man in woman's body has many sexual flings!  Man in woman's body poses nude for a painter!  Man in woman's body cooks dinner for widower husband!  Man in woman's body finds that piano lessons he took as a boy are now useless, but he can run secretarial equipment!  The thrills never stop.  There are any number of other irritating things about this book (personally, I find being forced to try to pronounce "Joan" as "Joanne" really irritating, but that's probably just me [If you want it pronounced "Joanne", spell it that way, Bob!]), but I'll let you read the other reviews.  The summation is, for this lover of Heinlein, who has read almost everything he wrote, I can't reread this novel.  And for me, folks, that's really saying something 
 As part of a $250.00 order, I ordered the Michelin France Provence map in English, and the Michelin 2006 Red Guide France: Hotels and Restaurants in English - both Items they sent me were written in French, which are of no value to me.  I requested a shipping label to return the map and the book and asked they send me the English versions. The Amazon Outsourcing Desk in India refused both request.  I requested an American Amazon Customer Service Manager contact me on this Issue.  That has never happened.  I am also being asked my Satisfaction on a 3d book - Markets Of Provence - which they never sent me.  The remainder of my $250.00 order were the English Versions, as ordered.  My Overall Satisfaction:  Well below the 1 Star shown.  Actual Satisfaction "F Minus" for all departments in Amazon and far less for their very poor Customer Service and lack of ethical follow-up for their mistake 
 Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"? I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this "criminal spectacle" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company? Be "thoughtful 
 I went out and bought this book after seeing the reviews posted here and on other discussion lists. This is probably the worst book I have ever read on the subject. Anna Riva has more credibility than this guy! Llewyllyn Publishing House certainly does not seem to be bothered by the fact that they are marketing false information to the public. Who ever wrote in last and commented on the harmful effectd of combining traditions is correct. Hoodoo is not new age fantasy like the wiccan "religion" its a tried and true folk practice. The author seems to believe that he can mix Haitian Loa with hoodoo and blend in a bit of jewish mysticism for kicks. This book and the other Llewyllyn  mistake, Sticks Stones Roots and Bones are both just plain fantasy. 
 Normally I am a big fan of the little tikes name, but not so with this product.  I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and although the concept is cute, it is not like other Little Tikes products.   To begin with, the train frequently comes off the track.  Also to activate it, you must press the button where the conductor goes.  However, it is difficult for my daughter to place the figure on this spot without it falling off.  She often presses the button in the process which activates the train while she is still trying to put the figure on it which frustrates her.  Since this is geared for toddlers, you would think that Little Tikes would have put the button to activate the motion in a different spot from where the figures go.  Also, at age 2 1/2 she is quickly bored with it.  She has more fun letting it go on the floor across the room than riding on the track.  Needless to say, it is going back.  The only good feature is that you can "pack it and go" for away from home fun 
 This "toy" is the biggest waste of money! When I got it, there were few reviews out about it.  It is very complicated to use and the web site never works and there is nothing to do on it when it does.  They should be repaying all of us our money for having bought this! Don't waste your money 
 Unfortunately, I believe that this book had great potential, but fell short of delivering.  The book contains a good deal of interesting info, but all of this info can be found on the Internet for free.  The information on the Internet is a good deal more detailed though.  This book should have been proofed by someone who owns an LS1 engine.. 
 I'm still trying to read this one.  It's got just enough story that I want to find out what happens, but there's so much boring detail to drag through that it's taking forever.  I try reading a paragraph, but then get distracted by a speck of dust on my desk that's tremendously more interesting than reading yet another two-page description of yet another crater.  Which, boringly enough, is exactly like the last crater, except this one's a little bit bigger.  Or maybe it's smaller.  Or has a different mineral composition.  I'm really not sure, as I'm learning to skip ahead as soon as anyone drives into or flies over a crater.  If the science part of sci-fi appeals to you more than the fiction part (far, far more), this is a great book.  But if you like the fiction aspect better, or even just want a balance, you're probably best just skipping this one 
 I was ready to like this book. I wanted to like this book. I'm interested in this particular era and the author has a fine reputation for the historical novel. So I began reading with great anticipation - only to discover deep disappointment. I haven't read his other works but he really strikes out with this one.  The idea is an interesting one - intertwine the story of Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy with a famous murder case in which the wireless figures prominently.  The problem is the author seems to have lost all his understanding of dramtic writing - character development (there is none), tension (there is none, we know the outcome before the book starts), Plot (plodding), Pacing (the author gives away the wireless tie-in during the first chapter, so there is no mystery at all - no dramatic announcements by the keen and stalwart detective at the last moment to surprise and delight the reader).  These historic, naturally dramatic events are presented as if we were reading a dreadfully boring history book. And there is no dialogue at all! We only hear from the characters when the author dryly quotes from their letters. Rather then letting the characters speak for themselves and tell their own story, the author lectures us on all that happens. Historically more accurate perhaps but it makes for dull and dreary reading.  The murderer, Dr. Hawley Crippen, is so shockingly inept that one wonders  how the man was able to tie his own shoes. He is so stupid that he can not devise of a simple cover story to explain his wife's disappearance (like she ran off with another man, for example) He allows his girl friend to wear his wife's easily identifiable jewelry and furs - right in his own office! Does he imagine no one will notice? He even sends his flunky out to buy several suits of boy's clothing - all but telegraphing his intent to flee with his girlfriend disguised as a boy.  When its not being a dry-as-dust history book, this tome is like reading a stuffy newspaper article in the Times of London. A nasty twit killed his wife and was caught (yawn).  I gave the book two stars rather then one because at least the parts about Marconi and his struggles to perfect and commercialize his invention are somewhat interesting.  I would recommend it only if you are waiting in the dentist's office and there was absolutely nothing else to read (and you found it sitting there).   In summary: a depressingly dull and boring book. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one 
 I like Ludacris. Don't get me wrong.  But this album is kinda annoying.  The blow it out yer ass song is hard to listen to and repetitive.  The splash waterfalls song is also really redudant, if you heard it on the radio as many times as I did, you might agree.  He just talks through too much of this album... instead of rapping.. the beats are kinda weak and repetitive.. there are 3 good songs on this one: Diamonds in the Back, We Got, and Eyebrows Down.  The rest of them are kinda annoying.  But like I said I DO like Luda.. just get red light district or word of mouf instead 
 One tiresome, heavy-handed simile after another; agonizing, descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action; simplistic, trite phrasing and dialogue -- characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence, an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat; routine characterization; a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable; proofreading errors; fragmented, poor sentence structure -- this book is amateurish writing all the way around.  I cannot fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received.  I cannot understand the lack of proper editing.  I am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm, so imagine my disappointment when I was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the Prologue!  In fairness to the author (and with a hopeful attitude), I forced myself through the first 70 or so pages, however with each turning page I found myself reading along just for sport, my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous (and annoyed) with this juvenile effort. What could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time.  
 DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. this book promotes eating disorders, plain and simple. i'm a dancer, and i have always been thin, but the "suggestions" this book gives are absurd. dancers are very conscious of their bodies, compare themselves to other dancers and hold themselves up to high standards. this book pretty much says that a dancer who is 5'3" should be 94 pounds. this is so messed up. the book suggests a diet of 1200 calories a day. look at the titles: "why a dancer should diet: you can't hide anything in tights" and "the chain around the refrigerator." it shows a dancer ready to "feast" on garden products. besides that, this book was written in 1984. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 The film I bought at a retail outlet in Spokane WA contains no closed captions!  If I had known that, I wouldn't have bought it.  The box should have contained a clear message:  No Closed Captions!  (Parenthetically, Amazon.com's description indicates the film IS Closed Captioned.)    The content of the film is shallow, and it doesn't really address the issues raised in the more fully supported Greenwald film, Walmart, the High Cost of Low Price.  If closed captions are not an issue, however, buy (or rent) *both* films to draw your own conclusion.  Obviously, the truth about Walmart's impact on US cities and third world communities is somewhere between the images presented in these two films.  I found the Greenwald film much more convincing 
 This quick-read is a cheap thrill. It has some eloquent prose and an interesting premise; however, the story as a whole is marginal and actually quite banal. The author seems almost desperate to convey "realism", but relying on photographic descriptions of sexual acts and equally graphic renditions of sadistic brutality are simply not enough to make this story exceptional.   The protagonist, Frannie, is "too constructed" to seem real. Her extreme cynicism is perhaps refreshing at times and her linguistic ponderings are often quite amusing, but overall her personality is meatless. The lover/detective Malloy is a tired police cliche with a knack for some extreme sexual precision. Frannie's student Cornelius shows some potential as a character but quickly disintegrates.  The ending is quite over-hyped and actually rather disappointing. Blood and gore and a meager "explaination" - wow, what a surprise...  Overall, Susanna Moore shows us in this book that she can be clever with words; however, her attempt to portray gritty reality comes across as merely desperate for attentio 
 So...I bought this for our 7 month old.  What a nightmare.  What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE.  It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it. It just doesn't happen.  And then...when you DO get your baby in, the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child's hind end.  Forget the bar cover.  It is just as narrow.  This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine, they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING.  To add to it, the back cusion part doesn't even go up to the top of the back support.  My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed.  The cusion part totally doesn't cover it.    Just bad.  Just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart 
 I'm wcw 4 life but this cd was pretty bad the theme songs go for about 1 minute the only good songs are Crush Em' Seek and destroy and take it the rest are all bad. I suggest you dont buy this c 
 I saw most of this movie with my children; they watching a little afternoon TV while I cleaned. I was pretty surprised to see the content of the Wicca religion, and Wicca songs about Earth Wind and Fire sung by "nice girls" with vampire teeth. They made it sound like, "Oh we are Wicca, there is nothing wrong with that!" Another reviewer mentioned that this would never be tolerated if this movie included dogma from Judaism, Islam or Catholicism. I let them finish watching, because I wanted them to see the whole thing before I explained to them that many people in the world believe that Wicca is a religious venue for witchcraft. I am not sure if they caught the whole idea about Wicca from the movie, but you know, these tiny little minds are like sponges. Next thing you know, my daughter will be casting spells saying, "but mom, I saw it on Scooby Doo!" I agree with another reviewer that it should be clearly stated on this movie that it contains content about Wicca. I only saw it on TV, which I could have turned off. What of those who spent their good money on it and found out later that it includes positive teaching about paganism.   
 This book begins with the arrogant assertion that psychology in general, and the author in particular, can change mankind and create a "caring and compassionate" society in which genocide and all lesser forms of evil will be unthinkable.  It then goes through several hundred pages of repetitive ramblings, introducing and summarily dismissing the theories of Hobbes, Freud, and many others, relegating Nietzche to the position of Hitler's ego, and ultimately arriving at a conclusion that could have been summed up in a short article: humans are frustrated by "difficult life conditions" (a phrase which grates on the mind with each repetition after the first 50 pages of overusage), which causes them to join together to lash out against those who they deem responsible.  His interpretations of the causes of the four instances of genocide which he chooses to discuss seem absurd in some cases, and contradict themselves in others.  The last two chapters outline the author's naive plan for the construction of a warm and fuzzy world of understanding and compassion.  Even if his plan were plausible, his view of human nature is ultimately deluded and irrational, and it is therefore of no value.  Some may say this reviewer is cynical or jaded, but I prefer realism to useless optimism.  An authoritative book on the psychological drives behind mass killings which brings together the ideas of many great minds and uses convincing evidence to support itself would be most welcome.  This, however, is not it 
 As is often the case with Western scholars writing on things Russian, one simply cannot properly understand Russia -- culturally or politically -- without first understanding Byzantium and Eastern Orthodoxy.  Russia is a  heir to Byzantium, and Orthodoxy determined and shaped its culture.  Mr.  Wortman tends to treat his subject as if he were part anthropologist, part  literary theorist, part psychologist -- all premised on the assumption that  the idea of Monarchy itself was and is simply a "forest of  symbols", as arbitrary in its connection to any sort of transcedental  meaning as any other "system.  This betrays the disease of modern  academia: political systems are mere ideologies, constructions that mask  power.  To ignore the theology of the Orthodox Church and the various  writings both in Greek and Russian on Monarchy is an oversight to say the  least.  To try and psychologize or play with semiotics as a way to unmask  the Russian Monarchy is bad history.  The Czar and the Church represented  the two heads of the double eagle inheritted from Byzantium.  One head --  the Czar -- protected the Kingdom and the Faith from foreign invaders and  preserved a Christian Kingdom in rule and law; the Church -- the other head  of the eagle -- tended to man's salvation and his soul.  These two heads  worked synergistically.  This is the essence of the Russian Monarchy: the  Czar's role cannot be separated from his duty to God and the Church.  To  understand how this works and why, turn to Byzantium or Pebodenostev 
 I bought this book soon after we adopted our daughter.  I found the writing style to be convoluted and precocious, much like the way children speak in contemporary movies (adult words from a child's mouth).  Sorry, not a fan.  We are still looking for a book that addresses an open, domestic adoption that can speak to children, not adults 
 This is a work of polemic; I understand that. As lowly as I rate the author's religious stance, I give him his right to defend his (albeit extreme) opinion.  What irks me about this book is its complete lack of accuracy. Equating witchcraft with devil-worship, calling transcendentalism a cult and Marxism and Existentialism "religions" is only the start of it. I'm fairly convinced that Mr. McDowell did not do any research at *all* for this book.  If one is going to write books stating how horrible various religions are, one should at least learn the facts about those religions first 
 Well . . .Lemme see it wasn't horrible the sex scenes and do not have enough life in them it is as though actors are bored, although the opening sex scene with Amber Newman saved it all, the only reason I watch the film over and over and over again, I gave it a whole star just for that scen 
 This book explains how to cover up bad points about yourself, and how do deal with personal or illegal questions, but certainly gives  very few good answers to help win a job.  There are plenty of better interview books out there 
 Maybe someone should inform Vicente Fox.  It's amazing what liberals write these days.  And by the way, the Republicans and the Democrats are two sides of the same coin, two halves of the same party. They aren't that different. Both want massive immigration, both want America involved in wars all over the world, both want to move our jobs to foreign countries, both support the new multicultural society, both of them are chock full of people who marry across the race lines, neither really cares for religion (regardless of what the politicians say...I don't see the Republicans putting prayer back into the schools), both woefully disregard the Constitution, ad infinitum 
 I saw SpaceNavigator PE at Macworld controlling Google Earth,  - it worked,  - I was very impressed,  - I tried it at the Macworld Expo - I ordered one.   Then I had to return it because it only worked with one or two apps. and I only wanted for Google Earth and now I find out there is no drivers!   What's wrong with the Mac software that was shown at Macworld?  Why can't users download and use the Macworld software until the next release? 
 I agree with all the other one star reviews (would give it zero if I could).  The author is a snob who  doesn't see the people whose lives she is supposedly reporting on as human beings in any way equal to herself.  If they take their "menial" jobs seriously she looks down on them.  She demeans hard work and celebrates entitlement.  For another view of the poor with some conception of how people's behavior shapes their lives, read LIFE AT THE BOTTOM. 
 I was looking for a real thriller, and thought I would try one by David Baldacci. I had read a very favourable review a while back, and I have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of Absolute Power.  After reading reviews at Amazon, I picked Last Man Standing. However, I was really disappointed. For me it wasn't thrilling at all. Several times I had to force myself to pick it up again to continue reading. For me, a good thriller is a book you can't stop reading, even if it's getting late and you really, really should try to get some sleep instead of continue reading.  Examples of great thrillers I have read are: The Firm by John Grisham, The Day After Tomorrow by Allan Folsom (nothing to do with the weather-related movie of the same name) and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.  But Last Man Standing was quite the opposite. Sure it had its moments where it got exciting for a while (the final shoot-out for example), but those times were quite rare.  I've been trying to figure out why I didn't like it, but I can't say I know why. I do think that a lot of what happens in the book is quite far-fetched (especially the reason the hero Web London froze during the ambush) and that the characters are pretty one-dimensional, but that's not enough of a reason. Both The Day After Tomorrow and Angels and Demons have plenty of far-fetch twists and one-dimensional characters, but they were still exciting reads. I can't come up with a definite answer as to why I didn't like Last Man Standing - I simply just didn't care for it.  Writing a negative review like this will probably earn me a few unhelpful votes, but I think it is important to also review books you didn't like. Otherwise you risk getting an unbalanced view. However, I do admit that it is much more fun to review books you really liked.  But to finish, if you are looking for a good thriller, skip this one and try one of the other three I mentioned above. 
 The only good thing about this movie was the special effects involved in the parting of the sea of reeds.  Indeed, this was well done.  The acting, direction, and the script was an absolute abomination from the reference point of any reasonable level of inspection.  Now, I know that artistic license is usually taken in the production of such a movie, but if one wants to make a movie that involves some made-up items added to the actual story, then he should at least make it interesting and meaningful.  You want to see a good movie?  Then see 'Moses' starring Ben Kingsley 
 Posing as a journalist Bill Kurtis has now shown that he has a very definite agenda, that being to abolish capital punishment, and not be persuading anyone that it is wrong for the state to kill, but repeating the half-truths and outright distortion of disgraced and indicted former Gov. George Ryan, who freed more than 150 stone cold killers off his state's death row. In his book tour, particularly on an appearance by Larry King, Kurtis shows that he is a tourist in the land of criminal justice. Those of us who live there know the facts are very different and while the system certainly makes mistakes, they are about as common as human rabies 
 Alice Randall's original concept for "The Wind Done Gone" was for it to be a parody of "Gone with the Wind" in the style of "Shamela."  I haven't read "Shamela" (or "Pamela," which it is based on), but from what I have gathered, "Pamela" is a story about a virtuous woman who scorns her employer's advances, while in "Shamela," this woman is turned into a whore who was playing her employer all along.  If Randall was trying to make a story like that, then she succeeded.  If "Gone with the Wind" was a world of strong, intelligent, good white Southerners and their stupid but kind-hearted black slaves; then "The Wind Done Gone" is a novel where those white people are shown to be morons and fools who understand little and are really controlled by those they thought they ruled (unless they're gay, like "Dreamy Gentleman" and "Beauty" - then they're nice people).  In this sense, "The Wind Done Gone" succeeds.  Unfortunately, Randall was so busy ripping down the characters of "Gone with the Wind" that she forgot to create her own.  I totally agree that Cynara/Cinnamon/Cindy is a Mary Sue.  Unfortunately, she's not a very interesting one.  She spends most of the story whining and moping about how she is so beautiful yet no one will ever accept her because she is black and she can't believe her parents betrayed her and on and on and on...  The only time she does anything is when she leaves R. and enters into an improbable menage-a-trois with a black Congressman and a black woman who reminds her of Mealy Mouth (Melanie).  By that time, I could care less.  With a boring heroine (and that's particuarly insulting, considering what a complex heroine Scarlett O'Hara was) and a story that goes nowhere, this book doesn't have much.  I didn't buy that any of the characters of "Gone with the Wind" would act as they did in this book.  The idea of Scarlett taking blame for something Cynara did, Melanie killing a slave out of anger, or Gerald having sex with Mammy is preposterous.  However, if Randall had managed to make an interesting story, I would have forgiven it.  Unfortunately, she didn't.  The only character who really benefited from any revision was Lady (Ellen O'Hara) but the revelation that she had black blood seemed to only make an unclear point.  This book is good as a curiosity, and nothing more.  
    What an insult to the apostle Paul and God as well.Believe me poeple,John T.Bristow`s message is not of Christ.There are too many women wanting to blinded by these lies,but the truth of the bible is simple and simply put.The bible says the man is the head of woman just as god is the head of man.The bible says woman are not to teach or have any authority over any man.Take it up with God poeple!!!This kind of stuff just shows you that these are the days when good is traded for EVIL 
 This toy looks great in the ad but it took us 2 hours to blow  the dozen or so chambers up.  The instructions were terrible.  You have to force too much air into one chamber so that it will go into the next.  The chambers do not stay inflated and some don't work at all.  My son does still have fun with it but I wouldn't buy it again 
 More ignorant ramblings from someone who hasn't done any research, which is typical of the rabid Christian 
 I was listening to water boil this morning. I preferred it to this album 
 Here are excerpts from Avery Cardinal Dulles' review in "First Things" (Oct 2005). _________________ The overarching thesis seems to be that in all these areas social change makes it possible for Christians to overcome the blindness that had previously afflicted their moral vision. The doctrinal change, in Noonan's estimation, is in many cases an about-face, repudiating the erroneous past teaching of the magisterium itself.   More than half of the book deals with slavery...Jesus, though he repeatedly denounced sin as a kind of moral slavery, said not a word against slavery as a social institution. Nor did the writers of the New Testament. Peter and Paul exhort slaves to be obedient to their masters. Paul urges Philemon to treat his converted slave Onesimus as a brother in Christ. While discreetly suggesting that he manumit Onesimus, he does not say that Philemon is morally obliged to free Onesimus....   ...[T]he popes were far from silent. As soon as the enslavement of native populations by European colonists started, they began to protest, although Noonan gives only a few isolated examples. Eugene IV in 1435 condemned the enslavement of the peoples of the newly colonized Canary Islands and, under pain of excommunication, ordered all such slaves to be immediately set free. Pius II and Sixtus IV emphatically repeated these prohibitions. In a bull addressed to all the faithful of the Christian world Paul III in 1537 condemned the enslavement of Indians in North and South America. Gregory XIV in 1591 ordered the freeing of all the Filipino slaves held by Spaniards. Urban VIII in 1639 issued a bull applying the principles of Paul III to Portuguese colonies in South America and requiring the liberation of all Indian slaves.   In 1781 Benedict XIV renewed the call of previous popes to free the Indian slaves of South America. Thus it was no break with previous teaching when Gregory XVI in 1839 issued a general condemnation of the enslavement of Indians and Blacks. In particular, he condemned the importation of Negro slaves from Africa. Leo XIII followed along the path set by Gregory XVI.   ...In A Church That Can and Cannot Change, Noonan gives only a few glimpses of this complex history. He correctly notes that the Catholic magisterium in past centuries never made an absolute condemnation of slavery as such. But he contends that John Paul II reversed the traditional teaching. In support he quotes a statement of John Paul II in 1992. Speaking at the infamous "House of Slaves" on the Island of Gore in Senegal, from which innumerable slaves had been exported, he declared: "It is fitting to confess in all truth and humility this sin of man against man, this sin of man against God." Noonan adds: "What this confession did not remark was how recently the sin had been discovered." But if we look up the quotation, we will find that the pope is here speaking of the slave trade, which had repeatedly been condemned. Far from changing the doctrine, John Paul is explicitly reaffirming the position of Pope Pius II, whom he quotes as having declared in 1492 that the slave trade was an enormous crime, magnum scelus.   Noonan has one further argument for doctrinal change. In 1993, in his encyclical Veritatis Splendor, John Paul II took, from Vatican II's pastoral constitution on the Church in the modern world, a long list of social evils: "homicide, genocide, abortion, euthanasia and voluntary suicide . . . mutilation, physical and mental torture and attempts to coerce the spirit; whatever is offensive to human dignity, such as sub-human living conditions, arbitrary imprisonments, deportation, slavery, prostitution and trafficking in women and children; degrading conditions of work which treat laborers as mere instruments of profit, and not as free responsible persons." Where Vatican II had called these practices "shameful" (probra), John Paul II calls them "intrinsically evil." In the same encyclical the pope teaches that intrinsically evil acts are prohibited always and everywhere, without any exception.  Did John Paul II, by including slavery in his list of social evils, effect the revolution in Catholic moral theology that Noonan attributes to him? It seems to me that if he had wanted to assert his position as definitive he would have had to say more clearly how he was defining slavery. He would have had to make it clear that he was rejecting the nuanced views of the biblical writers and Catholic theologians for so many past centuries. If any form of slavery could be justified under any conditions, slavery as such would not be, in the technical sense, intrinsically evil.   According to the logic of Noonan's argument, whatever holds for slavery would have to be said for deportations, subhuman living conditions, and degrading conditions of work. But could not degrading or subhuman conditions be inevitable, for example, after some great natural disaster in which mere survival is an achievement? Individual deportations of undesirable aliens occur continually as a matter of national policy today; mass deportations could perhaps be necessary for the sake of peace and security. If pressed, I suspect, the pope would have admitted the need for some qualifications, but he could not have specified these without a rather long excursus that would have been distracting in the framework of his encyclical. So far as I am aware, he never repeated his assertion that slavery is intrinsically evil. Neither the Catechism of the Catholic Church nor the recent Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church... speaks so absolutely.   For all these reasons Noonan's case for a reversal of doctrine is unconvincing. Jacques Maritain provided some helpful distinctions in his book The Rights of Man and Natural Law....[C]ertain attenuated forms of servitude, such as serfdom, are not opposed to natural law except in its secondary requirements or aspirations. These lesser forms of servitude...cannot be eliminated except by degrees....These concessions do not seem to me to be a reversal of the original teaching but rather a nuancing of it. 
 As a big fan of the 20 or so L. M. Montgomery books I've read and re-read, I was so excited to finally find a copy of this book. But when I started reading it I was really disappointed. I know this book was published posthumously and wondered if maybe she hadn't had time to polish the stories in it. Basically, I found it boring; one or two stories I couldn't even bother to finish, and others I've never re-read. None of the stories were wholly satisfying; each lacked something of the charm and entertainment of her previous short stories; those that started well ended flat.  Another reviewer mentioned that they didn't find L.M. Montgomery's previous short stories satisfying, but I enjoyed the style of those earlier ones, which is perhaps why I didn't like these; they really have a different flavour to her other stories, although she still includes a number of her common themes 
 I burn about 50 CDs a week in live music trades.  I can tell you from experience that these discs do not last.  After a year or so, they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems.  Any scratches that they have only make it worse.  I recommend using Sony, Fuji, or TDK.  All the others are cheaply made in comparison and just don't stand the test of time.  So if you care about preserving your CDs, don't use these ones 
 Vulgar, sloppy Donal Loge (last seen as complainer in Mel Gibson's film 'The Pa- triot', plays stoner and womanizing slouch,  who happens to be kindergarten teacher (!!),  who gets wake up call while trying to charm  the pants (literally) off John Goodman's real  life wife! He meets his match and learns a few  things along the way. All-American Steve's get looked up to in here; especially Steve McGar- rett! Horay for that, otherwise this sort of dull film would get two star rating from moi 
 1) Drawings seem a little grotesque.  The proportion and perspective is often askew, and human figures are distorted.  Not terribly pleasant to look at.  2) Is this a story about a trip that one of the authors took?  It seems like a self-indulgent storyline ("Let me write about a trip a took!") and when I read it, I'm left wondering why I should be all that interested in this particular seven-state route.  3) Taking off all your clothes and running around because you're in Nevada? (Even if the author did this in reality, it doesn't add anything to the story.  A good editor should have told them so.)  4) Weird geography.  Missing from the itinerary are Indiana, Illinois, and Utah (or Idaho).  Was the story too long with these included, or was their nothing witty to say about them 
 I was disappointed with this book after reading all the rave reviews others had submitted.  Carolyn touched on a wide range of topics briefly, and most of her advice would be applicable to people fresh out of school, as those who have already been working for a while would have encountered those situations and found a way to manage them by now 
 I suppose I'm going to be alone in these reviews in complaining loudly about Ellis's stylistic sloppiness.  I recall a particularly amusing section in the introduction in which he describes Jefferson's message in the Declaration as "a recipe for anarchy," and proceeds to note that a government which "attempted to operate in accordance with these principles would be committing suicide."  Yes, Joseph, a government attempting to implement no government would be doing itself in.  Is this what passes for lofty criticism these days?  I picked up this book in an effort to become more interested in--and more fair to--Thomas Jefferson.  I went in believing him to be a cold, conniving man whose life was a long exercise in "do what I say, not what I do."  This book did nothing to change that impression; if anything changed, it was my opinion of Ellis, of whom I'd had somewhat higher hopes.  His writing is not nearly good enough to cover up his attempted slights of hand in excusing Jefferson's worst characteristics; in my book, "psychological agility" isn't distinguished from hypocrisy--it IS hypocrisy.    The book's tone reminded me rather startlingly of the modern theory texts I was once forced to read; full of unprovable suppositions and distinctions without differences.  
 I was filled with anticipation when my book arrived and was looking forward to reading it.  What a disappointment!  I didn't even get past page 8.  It bored me to death.  I think that this book is such a waste of time. I was so disappointed with it I immediately sold it.   If you're planning to read some erotica, better read Anais Nin's 'Delta of Venus".  Now that is a good book 
 Like Moo/Baa/Laa this is another book that attempts to be silly but ends up being stupid! The books messes it up in the very beginning.. "Aardvark Admiring". That is just plain stupid! If you want silly; try "four fluffy feathers on a fiffer-feffer-fef" Sandra is no Dr. Seuss for sure!  Even my 14 month old thinks this book is lame! If I start reading this; she brings me the Dr. Seuss ABC.  I found one good use of this book! It makes an excellent table levele 
 The key to getting out of poverty, is NOT to get into poverty to begin with. Examples include having children, but not having the financial stability to raise them. As well as the irresponsible usage of credit cards, which can amount to serious debt, getting married/divorced, taking out a second mortage on your home, after you have already paid your home off. etc, etc, etc,    Adam J. Moraine Des Moines, Iowa 
  The title of this book is misleading.  It should be "The 50 Most Unforgettable Actresses of the Studio Era whose films can be viewed on cable network TCM."  It is by no means a definitive list of 50, because it omits the great box office champions of other studios such as 20th Century Fox and Paramount.  The most obvious example is Betty Grable, possibly the greatest box office champ of all.  The essays are relatively short summarising the key points of interest of each of the actresses.  As a superficial volume to which you may refer when viewing TCM, the book has merit.  Buy it for what it is but don't believe the title 
 This is not so much a novel as a long story: barely 100 small pages with big print.  In my opinion Harry Crews is the greatest living English-language novelist; unfortunately, this is one of his lesser works, if not the least of his works.  If you already have everything by Harry Crews, try the DVD Searching For the Wrong-Eyed Jesus.  This is a pseudo-documentary about the South in which Harry Crews plays the cracker mystic.   
 I paid for the movie and never received it nor did I get my money back from Amazon.co 
 ABC-CLIO STEALS FROM THEIR AUTHORS, PAYS THEM NOTHING, AND ROBS THEM BLIND. DO NOT PURCHASE BOOKS FROM THEM OR FROM THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. BOYCOTT THESE THIEVES!! 
 I was excited to see this until I found out which movies would be included. Weird Science? Come on. It should have been the Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink and St. Elmo's Fire 
 When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful 
 I had an experience almost indentical to that of the other reviewer. The instructions were very difficult to decipher but I found other really straight-forward instructions online......in English. I did everything according to the instructions and when I pushed the lever.........nothing. I will return it and look for a different brand 
 This video was not animated like the classic Chuck Jones features such as "The Cat In The Hat" and "The Grinch".  My daughter was rather disappointed to see the camera scanning over pages of the books she already owns along with paper cutouts of the characters floating around as a cheap replacement for animation.  We give this video a thumbs down 
 Not sure about this one. Really enjoyed the Woman in White. I found this one a little tedious and slow quite despite the  very high esteem in which it is held by Wilkie fans.   
 I purchased these as a replacement for some Joe Weider shorts I have had for many years that have started to wear out.  I bought 3 pair of these shorts, worn 2 of them 1 time each, washed them, and they both came apart near the seam.  The seams themselves did not come apart, but the actual fabric itself split in two like a 'run' in panty hose.  The third pair is still in the box and I have not worn it, but I figure that the same thing will happen with it as well.  Also, one of the pair had one leg about an inch longer then the other leg. The one leg also fit tighter and you could tell the cut was wrong.  Like I said, very poor craftsmanship and materials 
 I came across McCarry after reading Mark Steyn's claim that he was another real ex-spook novelist and better than LeCarre.  Well, lots of things are better than recent LeCarre, but at least to judge by this book McCarry is a journeyman writer who doesn't come close to comparing to LeCarre in his prime.    Yes, his intelligence background lends surface realism to his descriptions of a hunt from one end of the world to the other-- the part set in a remote corner of China where Kafka meets Genghis Khan is especially convincing and amusing.  But too much of this covers standard airport novel stuff-- the old (by now very old) Nazi in South America, the way-too-much-to-swallow-mystery (which covers all the ground from ancient Judea to Osama bin Laden-- by way of Heydrich's Czechoslovakia!), the band of retirees assembled to solve it all who fall somewhere between Doc Savage's Fantastic Five and one of those aging-actor-work-program movies like The Wild Geese.  The real point is that McCarry is telling a plot-- a whopper of one-- and can only tell it by sending his main character from one part of the world to the next where, conveniently, someone who we are told will tell him nothing promptly tells him everything.  LeCarre, on the other hand, uses the dilemmas of spying to explore character.  The mystery in Tinker, Tailor could hardly be smaller (one's a mole, which one is it?) yet it's vitally involving.  The mystery in Old Boys could hardly be bigger yet it's-- oh, that old thing again.  Whatever 
 This not a terrible book -- it's a decent book with a poor title.  It should be called something like "A Random Walk Through Web Programming with PHP." There's certainly nothing advanced about it.  This book would be ideal for someone who has  just learned PHP but lacks any real knowledge of computer science 
 Readers will save themselves much unrewarding labor by disregarding both "Precision and soul" and, I daresay, the highly-touted "Man Without Qualities," reading instead his first work "Young  Torless" and the stories collected under "Five Women."   Musil's derivative philosophical and psychological preoccupations invite  inevitable comparisons with Nietzsche and Freud, both of whose work is  vastly more durable and fruitful.  Despite the powerfully bracing, if not  occasionally repellent, astringency of his style, Musil's work subsequent  to "Five Women" falls considerably short of the enormous and  difficult ambitions which preoccupied his maturity; and, what's more, such  a gaping failure of world-historical pretension tends to pollute enjoyments  one might otherwise have had in reading it.  Read something by one whose  enormous abilities are truly equal to ungodly ambitions -- read Proust 
 This book is deeply disrespectful of SF readers.  Even if you can overlook the clumsy moralizing, the clichéd characters, the myopic focus on a single region of the earth and the thoroughly human aliens, the book only tells half of a story.   The book simply ends halfway through the story (practically in mid-sentence: if your plot invoves a countdown and the countdown is only half finished at the end of the book, then it's only half of a book) and you have to resort to the sequel to find out what happens to most of the characters.  There is no indication on the book anywhere that it is only half of a story.  So, it wasn't enough for Dietz and Ace to disrespect us with a lousy piece of work.  They had to go that one further and only give us HALF of a lousy piece of work.  Note: I'm not against books with sequels or even books that are part of a series.  I just feel tricked when a book is part of a series and I didn't know it going in.  To find out that I HAVE to buy the sequel to finish the story is more than disappointing, it's dishonest.  I was tricked into buying half of a story.  An author who will trick me once will trick me twice, so I'm not planning to buy any more of Mr Dietz's work at all.  I bought this book in a bookstore where there were no reviews to look at when making my choice.  It's that last time I'll make THAT mistake.. 
 One word can sum this cd up: awful. It is one of the worst FLA efforts ever put out 
 I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this.  I just don't get it.  The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry.   
 This book was a required text for my first semester of the Economics PhD core. I found the book to be a terrible disaster. Supposedly this book is a more basic approach to advanced macroeconomics, but I found I comprehended higher-level texts with greater ease than this book. The wording is very obtuse, which makes understanding the verbage difficult.  Once you get past the words and understand the meaning, however, the explanations are also very inadequate given the complexity of the material.   All in all, I have read my fair share of poorly-written textbooks, but I think this one tops them all 
 A simple DVD player, as long as you or a friend own an X-box console. Simply push in a little plastic knob into the controler socket and their you go oyu know own a standard of the line DVD player.The maginfacation is great the rewind and fastfrward is great.  It has all the extras a normal DVD player has and a easy to operate menu and layout.No overloads of pointless buttons just point out the obvious structer.You may be dissapointed in the response time, but that is not entirely the remote or players fault.If you own an old x-box console or a low memory X-box console  you may encounter slowness and maxed out freezing.Some mint condition titles may not even work.(I purchased "Little Nicky" sometime ago mint and to this date it still does not work on my X-box console)Batteries may play a roll.With out a doubt though this is the most easy and portable DVD player around with the acknowledgement of owning an X-box console first. A must have for a gamer/movie lover wit ha large movie library or a constant renter 
 I find this book unreadable. I read the first half and scanned the rest. I found it rather like a joke played on the reader rather than a novel. If this was a parody of style, it would work better if the reader was very  familiar with the styles being parodied. I felt betrayed for having bought  it. No character, if any could be called that, appeared to be remotely  likeable 
 A more appropriate title for this book is "Interviews with folks who are selling their own get rich or personal books, who happen to be millionaires through the product they are peddling -- Robert Allen style". This includes Mr. Amos and the 1-800-flowers guy, they are selling their own books. Besides all of the rhetoric hype, there is no valuable insight to wealth building. No meat. Each person simply explains the philosophy of their product/book and Litman announces how to goto their website plus their 800 number. There are some tidbits but they accumulate to less than 10% of this thin book. The first four interviews, nearly half of the book, contain zero value. They appear to be added as filler.  That said, two of the books featured "The Emyth" and "Rich Dad Poor Dad", are excellent books. I recommend buying these books directly instead of pecking for crumbs from this book 
 Hey Noam, I was wondering if it worked the other way too?  If you tell enough lies about things, manufacture evidence, cite sources that are dubious at best and then sell them to your unwitting disciples do you manufacture dissent for the things that get in the way of your political ideology like truth, facts, common sense, and reality?   A falsehood well footnoted is still a falsehood.  Anyone that reads Noam Chomsky should also read the Anti-Chomsky Reader.  This man is an extremist political ideologue that is hell bent on spreading his anti-American and anti-Israeli hate messages.  Noam's motto is if you manufacture a lie and tell it in countless boring pseudo books enough times people will believe it.  Sorry Noam I took a pill called reality when I was growing up and it immunized me from the likes of you, Michael Moore and whoever else sells your drivel.  While you Rage against the Machine, I and others like me, Rage against the Morons.  For those of you that blindly utter that Chomsky is the most cited reference on the planet I counter that McDonalds is the worlds largest restaurant on the planet.  Over indulgence in one can lead to poor physical health, sampling at any level in the other leads to disastrous results in one's mental health.  Like smoking, there is no safe level of exposure to Noam.  At least McDonalds can claim that their products taste good.  Neither's claim is generally a good reflection on society as a whole.  I was just wondering about this statistic's validity.  Is this scientifically documented or is it pop myth like everything else Chomsky writes.  Does the statistic include Chomsky citing his own opinions from one book and then presenting them as established facts in another?  Noam would interview 1000 people that witnessed an event. If 999 said things happened one way with only one dissenter Noam would discount, ignore, or attack the 999 and present the 1 as the established version if it fit with Noam's agenda. 
 It's a very boring book trying to explain what real estate career is all about... One will get better understanding by interviewing brokers and reading other books by Tom Hopkins, Danielle Kennedy, Carla Cross, Mike Ferry etc.    I saw the ratings and bought the book. Don't make the same mistake and waste money with this book.. 
 I bought these pillows as a Christmas gift for my fiance who definitely needs new pillows as his are old and have completely lost their shape. I have always had down/feather pillows and he loves mine. I thought these were a great deal and bought them for him. However, once they got here i was greatly dissapointed. Even if you stack up all 4 of them, they squish completely flat and are worthless as pillows. Plus, the feathers are of very low guality and are mostly hard quills that stick you in the face. I promptly returned these the next day. Please don't waste your money on these pillows 
 First off I'm a big Steven Seagal fan, but not only is this Steven Seagal's worst movie todate, it's also one of the worst movies I had to sit and watch in the vein hope that it would get better. I bought it, sat down and watched it that evening and then put it directly into the bin. This for me is in the same league as Van Damme's terrible Derailed. How could Seagal allow himself not only to get involved in something like this but even allow his name to be exploited in supporting such rubbish especially after the excellent Exit Wounds. I like both Tom Sizemore and Dennis Hopper but they were even bad in this. Dennis Hopper replays his part from Speed only with a very bad Irish accent. What little martial arts scenes there are involving Seagal could actually be anyone. The lighting is so low that it is impossible to tell who is actually involved in the martial arts scenes. It could very well be two standin stunt actors. I also noticed that Seagal kept doing that strange motion with his lips all the way through the movie as if he had a bad case of gas and was letting a few off. It also becomes annoying throughout the movie when at times you see Seagal on screen but we don't get to see him say his lines. They seem to be done in voice over when the camera is on another actor. The same thing is also evident at the beginning of Out For A Kill. The only positive advice I can give is before you go ahead and buy this make sure you rent it first and then decide, as I wish I had done.   
 LCD fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker wasn't stong enough. Anyhow,I could push it back. Then, the scale couldn't be turned on by tapping on the top. This is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual. I have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime! I think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken. This is the problem I can't fix.  The only thing I can do is sending it back.  Following up: According to the other review, I tried to make this scale "vibrating" using different ways of tapping. It didn't work no matter how hard I tried. I had to use my toe to lift up one side a little (about half an inch) and drop it on hard floor to make enough "vibration" to turn it on. I wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on. My Soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping. I have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate. Just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass. And also, be careful to use it in bathroom: moisture will make the glass surface slippery.  
 I'm an avid reader who takes pleasure in spending (too much) money on books.  Catherine Coulter, being that she's one of my favorite authors, takes up a large amount of space in my book cabinet along with Julie Garwood, Tami Hoag, and Patricia Cornwell.  However, I've noticed Ms. Coulter's losing a bit of her pizzaz when it comes to her more recent works.  Before I read this book, although in honesty, I have yet to finish it, I was elated upon seeing that it would soon be in stores.  I went to her website each and every day for the longest time, in hope that she'd post a preview as she always does.  When I read about Ruth's adventure, I was excited and determined to purchase the book with all haste.  Especially after witnessing the panic she was feeling.  However, once I'd begun reading Point Blank, I realized she'd put everything she had into a powerful beginning and not so much into the rising action.  To say in the least, I'm disappointed.  I'm currently stuck, for lack of a better word, on chapter twenty-one because I've been straying from reading this book.  Instead, I've enveloped myself in the wonderfully written novels Julie Garwood has provided.  I hate admitting the fact that although Coulter started out as my favorite author with novels such as The Maze, The Edge, Riptide, Eleventh Hour, Blindside, and Blowout, Julie Garwood is beginning to pull ahead with her brilliant works.    The dialogue in this book is so forced, along with the jokes and relationships.  I took a bit of a peek ahead and witnessed a kiss between Ruth and Dix that was both expected yet unexpected.  You see, he kissed her in a rather awkward moment.  The dog had just wet himself (and her borrowed leather jacket) when Dix decides this is the time to kiss her.  I'm sorry, but who does that?  There was no indication, from what I saw, at that moment to suggest he even desired kissing her.  Yes, it's bound to happen eventually- the two of them realizing they care about each other.  But at such an awkward time?  With no warning or no hint of what he'd been thinking or seeing?  It was certainly a moment I'd like to forget because it's one of the worst moments she's written thus far between two characters.  Yes, the dialogue is indeed forced, as are the relationships, jokes, and laughter.  I don't understand exactly what happened to my favorite author, but I sense this is perhaps a foreshadowing of the worst.  
 Well, first of all, if I were reading a book about kids, wanting to know about the society of children, I would want to know the author has done the work of raising kids, instead of studying documents of others who studied kids on a makeshift and very temporary basis. There's a great deal of difference between this "pop" psychology writer Hulbert and people who study children, like children, and look for what is good and workable. As I read this book, I kept thinking, how simple it is to write a book about what is wrong, and this is something Hulbert specializes in- according to her, lots of bad ideas exist in the world. This becomes tiresome throughout this book. In a world of cheap pundits everywhere, claiming that everything about everything is wrong, it is refreshing to read instead people like Derrida "the Work of Mourning" which speaks clearly about relationships and how they are made in individual psyches. I think overall, there is so much to be said about kids and relationships between them and with adults that is useful, that this book is unfortunately just is a rehash of each decades "look how bad and stupid people are after all" genre 
 I like the character Micah.  I'm really bored with hearing about his, err, outstandingly large physical attributes.  In fact, I'd love for a character in one of Ms Hamilton's books to be average.  
 I agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not the characters. He goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for "the swede", without letting us know who the Swede really is. Roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration. It gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. I loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times 
 I really don't know what the fuss is about with these old films.  My boyfriend purchased these and this past Sunday a friend of ours came over to watch Cary Grant back to back.  I literary had to fight to stay awake.  I think I slept through most of the two films we viewed and I probably didn't miss a thing.  Cary Grant may be a good actor but oh what garbage.  Can you honestly tell me these types of films were actually relevant enough to put out on DVD?  Hackney plots that go no where with tons of nonsense dialogue as filler.  Stupid, irrelevant, and just plain awful.  Who the hell could like such things?  Yes I was brought up on the Star Wars generation but I can appreciate good acting.  I love all the films which deal with classical novels but these types of films are just bad.  I guess like everything else they have their fan base but keep this celluloid slush away from me.  Recommended for an alternative to a sleeping pill 
 This movie gets 2 stars and not 1, only because the story is historically accurate. However, The acting, the photograpy and even the sound quality of this movie are all less than impressive.  Try "WE WERE SOLDIERS" instead. 
 Cutsey private investigator introduces a myriad of characters that never relate to the chase towards a solution to the mystery--and what's the main mystery?--"Where's my mother?", which never gets solved in the whole dull reading.  The author attempts to ompress you with details of the streets of Paris, which, also, muddles the tale.  This was my first test of Cara Black --also my last.  No thanks 
 There is much to say about this book, and none of it is good.  I am not well-versed in Aboriginal culture.  However, I can tell when someone is fabricating information.  Marlo Morgan has a fine time making up all kinds of rediculous details about Aboriginal life and culture.  She even seems to frequently confuse Aboriginal culture with North American Native American practices.  In addition, her writing style is clunky and laughably bad in places.  She didn't even take the time to ensure that the "important message" that she was making up was cohesive or followed any internal logic.  She just rambles on about various New Age concepts, presneting a hackneyed and confusing message about the evils of Western Civilization.  The really funny part is that Morgan doesn't seem to be able to shake her ingrained ethnocentrism, as she makes rediculous claims about Aboriginee feet being "hoof like," and claims with a straight face that up until the 1990's, Australians didn't have window screens.  It's just bad all around. 
 Doesn't tell you how to get anywhere when used with a GPS...simply shows you where you are.  Nothing more than a glorified paper map.  A complete embarassment 
 I received this camera as a gift and after 15 magical minutes recording with it, I ran into an error message: "Unit in safeguard mode - remove & reattach battery."  I did what I was told.  Several times.  Same message.  Argh!  (to my husband's chagrin, I read the user's manual completely before using it to avoid such a problem...why is this happening to me?!)  I searched the web looking for a solution, but all I found were perhaps hundreds of people with the SAME message on similar JVC model camcorders, rendering their cameras unuseable with little help from JVC once their warranty ran out.  Luckily I ran into the problem soon enough that we were able to return the product.  Sure, you might not believe me when I suggest to stay clear of this model.  I'm constantly disregarding Amazon reviews that preach "do not buy this product!", etc.  That's why I'm suggesting that you please take a minute to search the web for this error message before you buy this product and see if you're still convinced you want it.  Suggested search on Google: "jvc camcorder safeguard mode error". 
 This book is dripping with the worst kind of technology hype...  Very few redeeming qualities...  Don't waste your time/$ 
 Santa brought this item to my daughter for Chrismas and she was so excited to get it. She wanted it open as soon as she recieved it.  When we finally got it open and everything all set up and read the instructions nothing that it said it did worked.  The hair did not change color and the eyeshadow didn't come off.  We tried even using ice cubes instead of the little curling iron thing that came with it.  Still no luck.  My daughter still plays with it but it is not her favorite toy 
 Ouch!  The first 5 minutes of listening were already extremely painful and annoying.  I don't know what on god's green earth can drive a person to yell 50 times consecutively "ka-ching". After this traumatisingly painful beginning, things didn't really improve.  His "marketing superstar wisdom" consists of basic, common sense statements that I'm sure all of us have already heard at some point. As if things were not bad enough, he also attempts to sing.  This book-on-disk is one of the worst purchases I ever wasted my money on.  (= bad ka-ching! 
 The pictures are small and stingy looking and since this is a picture book that's a huge flaw. Plus, the most of the homes shown were remarkably ugly. 
 I had a different experience than the other reviewer. I would also consider myself a beginner golfer, but the Medicus has not worked for me.   It might work if you have never picked up a golf club and you are learning for the first time, but if you are trying to improve your swing it doesn't help.  You develop a way to swing the club without breaking the hinge, but it is still a bad swing.   I heard from a golf pro that it is good if you already have a solid swing and you are trying to improve it, but not good for beginners. 
 The mileage Suge Knight got out of tracks recorded by 2Pac ranks up with the "new" releases of Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly years after their deaths.  The game comes crashing down with Nu-Mixx Klazzics, a cheap means to re-release previously-issued cuts. There are classic tracks, but the new mixes are absolute garbage.  The legacy left in his much too short recording career of 2Pac can never be tarnished, no matter how his music is manipulated and twisted by others.  
 History of the arabs, the name seems quite unique, as there can be history of a race or a history of a time or history of third reich or saracens etc etc  once a history book is written i wonder what is in there to be edited 10 times? what prompted so many changes?? reprinting is ok As the author points out that the book has been written in response to 'a short history of saracens' by Ammer Ali which as per him stands 'obsolete'it is not known why. references to the holy quran mentioned in the book are not correct  pp 99---------2;100 is there instead on 106 ---------------14:40---------------------14:36 pp 99------------2:100 ................2:105 the verse is regarding the abrogation of a verse and revealing a better or a similar one which the author has mis interpreted and gave an oblique view of it pp103--------47:16,17 is there instead of 47:15 knowledge and interpretation of the quran of the author are excellent but oftenly distorted as ..comparing paradise to a place in arabia (taif)  pp174 "in art and architecture, in philosophy, in medicene, in science and literature, in governement, the 'original arabians' had nothing to teach and everything to learn" further he states "In ctesiphon, edessa,nisibis, damascus, jerusalem,etc etc they (arabs) viewed and  copied the work of architect, the artisan, the jeweller and the manufacturer"  not a single non moslem architect, jeweller etc has been named  chapter 21 the invaders from the desert brought with them no tradition of learning, no heritage of culture?? to the lands they conquered (this is incorrect) the comparison of the quranic verses to the 'old testament' is excellent the author has laid immense stress in depicting the words in the quran are 'borrowed' from old testament and formerly holy books  hittians are a very old tribe in the arab land and to this day regret their ancestors converting to Islam excepting a very few who are now the druzes and maronites in the lebanon the author being orthodox christian has attributed the fall of syria iraq eygpt etc to the internal squabbles in the countries and their religion (christianity) rather than the sacrificing spirits of the saracens at that time the author no doubt has done ample research to write the book, but a history of a race cannot be written in a few hundred pages,  the author could have  done a better job had he been non parochial and not confined his clientele to a selected few as the the comments have been indicated by New York times, as if for a novel or a fiction by some sundry autho 
 This is a field guide to the foreign land of our parents - a help & resource as our elders age & we must talk with them about medicine, hygiene, dependence, selling the car, loneliness & love. This book jumped into my hand because it's all about what we're doing right now -  taking care of our Poppa in his final years. While Poppa's son speaks his  father's language & can mostly get his frames of references, there are  over 40 unknown years before his son was a twinkle in his Poppa's eye.  Meanwhile I have only a smattering of references with this plodding  mischievous fellow who avoids saying yea or nay.  He also has an endless  well of stories about anything & these should be told to a bevy of  youngsters at his knees. I also know now that we're not at fault for his  oldness nor is it our job to make him happy. Only he can do that. It is our  job, however, to keep ourselves happy! This book has some eminently useful  information, strategies & ideas. Well done 
 Amazon.com should immediately cease selling this book.  It was published without Hawking's permission and is a blatant effort to ripoff Stephen Hawking!!    Go to his website, http://www.hawking.org.uk/info/iindex.html, and you will see the following admonishment:  "IMPORTANT NOTE It has come to our attention that the book "The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe" has been published. Professor Hawking would like to make it clear that he has not endorsed this book. The text was written by him many years ago, however the material has already been published in books such as 'A Brief History of Time'. A complaint was made to the Federal Trade Commission in the US in the hope that they would prevent the publication. We would urge you not to purchase this book in the belief that Professor Hawking was involved in its creation. 
 In 2001 during the (good ridance)time of your life craze they released a Cd to make every song accustic to like time of your life. 
 I've had an old coffee maker for a long time that makes good coffee but I thought I was ready for something even better.  I am disappointed with this one.  I thought I couldn't go wrong with a KitchenAid product, but sure enough, I did.  The design is attractive and I like that you don't have to purchase paper filters.  However, I have two problems with it: 1) The coffee isn't hot enough. I like a very hot cup of coffee because I put milk in it which cools it down a little.  My old coffee maker made very hot coffee so it didn't matter how much milk I put in, it was still hot.  Not so with this one.  The coffee was luke warm after I put my usual amount of milk in.  This is my main complaint and I'll probably have to return it for this reason.  2) Next problem is that I set the automatic timer so I could wake up to a fresh brewed cup of coffee.  I set it according to the manual instructions and I think I did it correctly.  When I woke up this morning, no coffee!!  What a disappointment.  I think I'll go back to using my free coffee maker from Gevalia that has reliably made good coffee for me for the past three years! 
 In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents.  Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths.  But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related?  What evil force is at work here and who can stop it?  And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction?  To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to "find herself."  Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.  The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern.  Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with.  As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.  Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like.  When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered.  When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees.  There are terrible lines illustrating this such as "that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out."  Another: "The mental itch was back.  What was it?  Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?"  Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.  This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs.  I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine 
 My daughter recieved this and 2 days later broken in box, gonna take it back 
 Worked after I opened the box.  Took on a plane...didn't work after the plane ride... Tried again after removing and repositioning batteries (repeatedly), then it worked!  Then, I tried to use it again later...didn't work!  Not sure if it's a loose connection or what ...when the speakers work they're great, but they hardly ever work : 
 Bought at a local builders warehouse super sale for $13 and the 1st time I used it, I was amazed at the speed with one page so then I tried with five pages; it jammed and I had to reverse a few times. I finally got through that first batch but then it would not turn on automatically again. Turns out the small, limit switch that activates the shredder in the paper slot had gotten jammed backwards with the reversing. I was able to get it back in place and made it through two baskets of nicely shredded documents 2-3 pages at a time. A few weeks later, it jammed again and it took awhile but I was finally able to reverse and forward to clear the jam. However, the small, cheaply made limit switch was no longer part of the unit (it apparently got shredded!) and now I have a nice, $13 steel wastebasket, so I cannot complain. Bottom line: great for 1-2 pages at a time but forget junk mail with more than one page folded and still in the envelope, unless you open, unfold, and feed 2-3 pages at a time 
 I'm sorry to say that this book is typical of christian books on sex.  The authors have a pre-determined opinion on a sexual subject, look for passages in the bible to support their opinion, then say that this proves they were right.  They, like most christian authors, use the more common MISTRANSLATIONS of the bible (e.g. King James Version) and also ignore the passages in the bible that contradict their opinions.  They also ignore what are the common interpretations of passages by biblical SCHOLARS (people who know what the bible means by studying the bible and related texts for most of their lives, along with the history and languages of the biblical cultures) and instead choose to believe whatever is the common interpretation that people they know have chosen.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  If you truly want to learn about sex, you should do so from someone with at least a rudimentary education.  God gave us a capacity for learning.  I don't believe he wanted us to blindly follow people who have no good reason for what they believe other than that's just what everyone they know thinks.  Also, the reason why so many women give high praises to this book in their reviews is that the author, since she is giving only opinions, tells misconceptions about what the bible says about sex that are believed by other women, thus reinforcing these misconceptions as well as earning praise for saying things with which others already wanted to believe.  If you are in a marriage, think very carefully about what the effect will be if you do (or more likely do NOT do) the things this book says 
 I have read many of Koontz's books and I have got to say that this is the worst one that I've read to date.  For those that have yet to sink their teeth into some of Koontz's better work, I would suggest Mr. Murder or Intensity.  Leave this one on the shelf to collect dust.  Or better yet, throw it in the trash with the rest of the garbage.  
 I was looking for a book on his music.  This book belongs in Fantasy.  It is a play by play of Mr. Mingus' sex life.  I have no desire to research him any further 
 Dalrymple does an excellent job of presenting isotopic dating as factual. In particular, he would have us believe that dating results converge on 4.5 billion years. In doing so, he conveniently ignores large numbers of  contradictory dates, and numerous other serious problems with isotopic  dating. Dalrymple's work will prove convincing only to those who have not  read the relevant geologic literature for themselves and/or who are already  predisposed to believing that the earth is very old 
 i never heard such stupit squealing from a boy.  it's like he a woman or sutphing.  i do like that suga suga song though, i won't deny that.  how you get so fl 
 Hard as it is to do, this film manages to make Jet Li look very, very bad. I kept having Karate Kid flashbacks! The story is the same old, same old, American martial arts move cliches, fighting for honor and all...in a place that is obviously NOT Los Angeles. The real disappointment is that the martial artists( in come cases obviously just local students for God sake!) are sub par and the choreography suffers for it. The action sequences are slow and awkward. Pass on this one guys 
 Look, it's on sale! Usually 800.00 now you can get it for only 150.00. And you won't find anyone else wearing this original. Make your drunken friends dizzy with envy. Spill anything on this shirt, it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill. Worth every penny. As a bonus, you can also wear this shirt while hunting. 
 I was very disappointed in this book about the great Margot.  Was it really necessary to put in all the salacious details of her sex life in order to give us a picture of her career and life?  I think a little more restraint on the part of the author was definitely in order.  I wanted to learn more about the ballerina's career on stage, not especially about what she did in bed and what her sexual prowess was.  I agree with the lady who said she would not recommend this book to her daughter, the budding ballerina as I thought the 'so-called' sex information on La Fontaine was tasteless and over the top. 
 a friend of mine recommended this book a while ago and i decided to give it a try. what a waste of time! after a so-so start it dissolves into a silly, improbable, absolutely unbelievable mess, the conclusion being particularly stupid  and unrealistic. if you want to do yourself a favour, stay with patricia highsmith instead 
 I had a VTech phone that lasted me 3 years before I spilled water on it and had to get a new phone. So I went out and got this Uniden phone without really researching any phones beforehand. It lasted a couple months before one day, it stopped working. I couldn't recieve or make calls, or get messages on my answering machine. I tried everything the website and owners manual said and called their customer support line and the lady told me to send it to Texas to be repaired (I'm in Virginia). So I decided to just forget about it and buy a new phone. Needless to say, I'm not buying Uniden anymore. 
 Schiff and Ya'ari are two "house broken" Israeli journalists, i.e. they are partisan supporters of the Labor Party and the Left.  This must be kept in mind when reading this book.  While they clearly show the reckless policies Sharon carried out, much of their ire towards him is political.  For example, while they decry Sharon's alliance with the Gemayal's Falangist Party, correctly pointing out its Fascist tendencies and pontificate about Sharon sullying's Israel's reputation by making an alliance with what is essentially a corrupt, mafia-like organization, suddenly,  10 years later, when Peres and Rabin (whose Labor Party they support) made the Oslo agreements with the even more murderous and corrupt Arafat and the so-called "Palestine Liberation Organization", Shiff and Ya'ari were praising the "pragmatism" of Peres and Rabin saying "you can't choose your peace partners".  Thus, we see that their primary agenda is political and not "truth seeking". (Incidentally when Arafat started his war with Israel in September 2000 Ya'ari went on television and said "I always knew the Oslo agreeements were a mistake").  Similarly, they (correctly) denounce Sharon's underhanded activities during the war, keeping the government in the dark about his activities, but then in 2004 when Sharon used undemocratic, dishonest procedures to betray his promises about not destroying the Jewish communities in the Gaza district, they suddenly claim he is a great, far-sighted leader.  Draw your own conclusions 
 I purchased this video for my sister who has disabilities but does chair aerobics at the senior center.  She enjoys exercising at an easy pace but this video is too fast for her to follow.  Even the older woman in the video looks bored or annoyed at times.  
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 This the first of Daninell's books I read.  I learnt that she was the Queen of romance novel since I was a teen.  I'm a little disappointed by the book because it's really boring for most of the part. It's like reading an alternative version of Princess Diana's traffic accident.  I realize that Daniell likes to repeat herself a lot.  There are too many reptitions of descriptions of all kinds.  It's also too predictable.  To me, everything that Bill did is really cheesy and unreal and his stubborness of rejecting and denying Anabelle after he became paralysed makes me wonder what a tyranny psycho he is that he just wants to inflict pain on the woman who loves him and who has nobody there for her at all. It's really hard to believe any man who acts so unreasonably stubborn on his own version of love and happiness that he can actually be an ideal partner for any woman.  Men like that are normally pretty controlling and emotionally abusive. This is the major element in the book that really turns me off.   I have to admit that the last part where Anabelle finally convinced Bill to be with her is quite touching.  I think Ms. Steel does have her crowds of fans.  My boyfriend's mother had been crying all the way thru the book.      
 This album is seriously a joke.  It has to be a joke, because Beck's voice has no soul.  Yeah, it supposed to be funky, but adding ________ noises to a beat that already sounds ambysal is like mixing matches with gasoline.  It's not funky, it dosent have soul, and the album is a turd.  I haven't figured out if I like Beck instead. This album has no rythem and is a slapped together lego set that looks liek a piece of _____.  If you want real cool music, try Trout Mask Replica instead.  Guero was better.  I haven't tried anything else, although Paper Tigers didn't sound very promsiing.  Avoid this train wreck.  The song Broken Train represents everything this flaming turd is 
 My six-year-old got this in her Easter basket.  She loves all kinds of art so we thought this would be something fun and different for her.   Not so.  The first page worked and she loved it, but the markers started to dry out very quickly.  By the time she got to the second page, the markers no longer worked well enough to dissolve the black coating.  My daughter colored over the same area about 100 times and still got only the faintest bit of the neon to show through.  She was very frustrated and heartbroken that her Easter present was such a dud.    I'd expect quality like this from RoseArt, but not from Crayola.  What a complete waste of money and time 
      While this book appears dated (1980) the substance of this text revolves around the historical events, places, and personalities which have brought "Arabia" to where it is today, focusing on the crucial historical times of each region, the 1880s, the 1920s, the British departure of 1968-1971.  This book remains relevant, and continues to serve as a useful reference to understanding this region.       Awkwardly, Kelly assumes a fair bit of knowledge on the reader's part.  The Trucial Coast is introduced and subsequently explored at length as if the reader is fully aware of where it is, how it came about, and of what it consists.  Wahhabism, on the other hand, is well explained and would help even a beginner of Middle East studies gain a fair insight into its origin, and relevance.  Overall, Kelly too frequently begins a train of thought independent of the background necessary to fully enjoy the generous and elaborate detail into which he delves.       By far, Kelly's most glaring shortfall in this book is the over reliance of verbal descriptions of the geography versus a few good maps.  A dominant, if not THE dominant, theme in Kelly's work is the ebb and flow of the people, and their religion, across the land.  So much of "The West" (in particular, Britain's) involvement with Arabia over the last two centuries has revolved around the definition and security arraignments of these borders, manifest in the modern era in the form of conflicts related to oil concession rights, and leading to wars in recent history.  To this day, many significant borders remain undefined.  Yet, his text contains only 5 maps, which together do not nearly cover the breadth of his discussion, and not one of which fully encompasses the theater of its accompanying discussion.  J. B. Kelly's work is fulfilling and exhaustive, but the lack of maps is significantly detrimental.  Readers seeking to gain a better understanding of this important region of the world would be well served by J.B. Kelly's Arabia, The Gulf & The West, but should have an atlas or online geography reference to accompany it. 
 I was expecting more because of the history on these tapes/DVD's. This one was disappointing as you don't feel like you did a workout. I like the older ones better with Tammy 
 Kodansha is the best, so we come to expect a higher level of quality in the material as well as a higher price.  As a student, the number of Kodansha books that I can afford to keep on my shelves is quite limited; and in retrospect, this particular dictionary was a waste of money.  The vocabulary is kept pretty small in order to make space for a more detailed description of each Kanji.  This doesn't, however, present us with any real information that could not be obtained through other dicitonaries of a higher vocabulary.  I would highly suggest instead the KODANSHA ESSENTIAL KANJI DICTIONARY, which I would personally not be able to live without.  
 This album is, well, not very good. The only reason I own a copy is because I have been a Sandra fan for so long. If your buying it for the enjoyment, try "Wheel of Time" or "Into A Secret Land" instead 
 I expected an autobiographical book by a writer discussing her craft and the internal struggles of her professional life. Instead I found a book too literate for the tabloid reader, not insightful enough for the demonically possessed.  The book mentions names whose relevance sometimes puzzled me; and summarizes books and movie themes, as if high school freshmen were the author's primary target. It discusses the seduction of the demon, mostly through other writers' observations. Why is it that we get a better sense of Henry Miller's "dictation" than Eric Jong's "seduction"? And while she could have genuinely and thoroughly discussed her affair with the former Mr. Martha Stewart to give us a deeper understanding of its effect on her writing, she fails to go beyond the surface.  The touch of love may turn a man into a poet, but this zipless seduction will barely teach you the alphabet 
 Cons:  Defect: the backlight does not work.  Shortcoming: has Palm OS 3.1, an early version for Handspring Visors. Neutral:  (expedited) Shipping time: 5 days Pros:  Price  PS: Vendor customer support contacted me and provided a replacement unit with a working backlight, free of additional charge :) 
 As a second generation Irish-American Catholic, I hoped to find a good story wrapped within the unique Irish-American perspective of life.  However, I was very disappointed for the following reasons:  1) the story was too simplistic (and full of tired cliches), 2) the characters were one-dimensional stereotypes and 3) the main characters (and their family) were claustrophobic in their smug superiority.  I have seen too many families that present just this outward image while hiding a truth that would be more beneficial for all to see the light of day.  Isn't it ironic now that the theme of the distorted family image of the O'Sulivan family is in fact duplicated by the depiction of the Coyne/McGrail clan.  Surely I won't be coming back for a second helping 
 Obviously, the rantings of a depressed, selfish and self-righteous woman, who for if these issues were not enough of a challenge, believes in the fraudulent and assanine thinking of Freud. To bad she didn't kick the bucket before she had the opportunity to launch such a demented attack on the very core of society, and what brings meaning to life: family. This sad woman's physical appearance, almost confirms the above alone - just a miserable, frustrated witch.  
 An admiring though shallow and poorly written account of a unique American genius. Though salted with several good anecdotes, Gordon's book mostly relies on the research and interviews of others and ultimately does little to explain McKinley Morganfield's life and times. For a writer who presumes to account for the life of a musician, Gordon's descriptions of various Waters recordings are especially poor. Far far better is his video documentary of the same name. One suspects the book is the assembled notes of that project 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 My two year old really doesn't like this book.  I got it since all the other books we have by the same author are really cute.  This one is just a grumpy book.  I'm sure there is a lesson, yes, but I will find another way to teach my son that bullying isn't right 
 Way too much radio techno talk...who cares about "segues" or what disk jockeys talk about in detail to play. Basic story okay but not nearly up to his prior books...especially Heart Seizure which was the best 
 This book is too general to serve any real user of office space. You would be better off educating yourself on the market and how to negotiate effectively through free web sites such as Pikenet, and Starboardnet.com 
 This book is very detailed (though not endnoted very clearly). In fact, I suspect the author may have been paid by the word...Unfortunately, it is not very cohesive. He makes a good case that bad things happen in the world, and that Israel negotiates often with US involvement, but I do not think he ties the two together into any sort of causal relationship, which is what the book promises. Just because two phenomena occur does not mean they are related to each other. I was hoping it could clearly make such an argument, and wanted him to succeed, since I know people who recommended this book. But he failed for me 
 I had to read this book for my college course. Most of the people in the class did not like it or agree with many of nakkan's viewpoints. I personally think he is repeating NA to us in his own words. if you are not into NA, yo will not like this book.   Nakkan states abstinence is the only way to recovery, I beg to differ with him, there are many successful treatment modalities that do not include total abstinence such as methadone and methadone maintenance. Also, Naltraxone for those that are in disagreement with MMT. how about Antabuse? That is medicinal, he also thinks that is not "real recovery" then because it is medication assisted recovery?  Did not like this book or his opinions 
 This book is a big disappointment. Pages and pages and pages of text. Precious few photos or illustraions. No "Step 1 illustration, Step 2 illustration, Step 3 illustration..." I ordered three of this book for my sons-in-laws. I sent them all back and got the Reader's Digest "Fix it Yourself" instead. More expensive but A) updated recently, and b) profusly illustrated. Very simple to follow. Don't waste your time or money on this wordy loser 
 Foremost, the episodes that they picked weren't all good (certainly not the "The Very Best.."). Second, the general editing was poorly done. Third, the extra footage featuring parts of interviews previously cut out, should have never been put back in. The footage was boring and a waste of time. All, I can say is this tape is dissapointing.  Don't bother to buy it 
 I put this audiobook in my Wish List several weeks before it came out.  What I was hoping for was some good info on the psychology and execution of the lost art of conversation. What I got was an endless list of do's and do nots.  I ONLY recommend this for EXTREME introverts.  If you are looking to polish your social skills or socialize with anyone other than friends then keep looking 
 This "documentary" is a blatant attempt to contribute to and fester the 'myth' of Henry Darger, a reclusive, backward man who concocted a trite and repetitive story (18,000 pages) filled with extreme inconsistencies (his "Christian" army is involved in bloody warfare - tenets of Christ were those of a pacifist, etc) and sadomasochistic tendencies.  It seems he lived in his own sullied world, formed mostly by an extreme fascination with children and the sufferings of Christ (he had upon his wall 13,000 representations of crucifixes).  His landlords found his room after he died, stuffed with inumerable articles of junk, stacks of wet papers, hairballs, empty bottles and yet, being artists and entrepreneurs themselves, they hatched a theme to create Henry Darger as a genius of 'outsider art', their attempts succeeded, Darger's immature works, mostly traced drawings, slapped on with some vivid color schemata, in every sense lacking any cohesive aesthetic, have sold for millions now.    The room itself was photographed, cataloged and inducted into the 'folk art' hall of fame.  Darger was seemingly a lunatic, at odds with his warped Christian conditioning and society itself, he would hide in his room for hours on end, lusting after children and cut out articles and trace faces onto pieces of toilet paper (he was poor).  There's no doubt that he holds some fascination for us, mainly because of his weirdness but eventually even that is usurped by the painstaking tediousness and forcefulness of accepting such unworthy levels of art into our consciousness, as this documentary begs us to do.    Since he is dead, he can not speak for himself, and thus, his 'myth' is assurred, bringing the curious to worship at his feet and sell his works for staggering prices 
 This book is NOT Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrates as listed.  It is Cram101 Textbook Review to accompany a textbook.  This is very false advertising and Amazon should correct the listing so that further people are not misled.  
 I truly feel sorry for Pynchon, knowing that writing this atrocity of a novel probably cost him many months of life.  By all means, if you want to read it, get it from the library as I strongly advise against laying out cold cash for this mockery.  Does anyone really care that a man's sexual episodes predict German V rockets falling on England?  Is it really important to World Literature that a man dreams he is being sucked down a toilet surrounded by crap and toilet paper and can even smell which race the crap came from?  The so-called Intellectuals who praise this claptrap are the same Great Thinkers that believe Ulysses by James Joyce is the best novel of all time.  I would rather read the worse writing of de Balzac than waste one more second perusing either of these novels.  Both these "novels" are truly "sound and fury .... signifying nothing."  
 I came to Blowback by way of a year-long research project on  globalization. Over the past year I have read dozens of books, both scholary and popular, on this topic. Right - Left - Love America - Hate America - Multi-Cultural - Eurocentric; I've suffered through them all ( happily, there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject ).   First let me state that Chalmers Johnson, this regrettable book notwithstanding, is not by profession the village diot. Johnson is a highly respected economic and political analyst, a man who used to be worth listening to.  What happened?  How did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly unanalytical smorgasborg? Where did the imperialist conspiracy rant come from? Johnson, where did you go?  Well, the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge.  His take on America's military policies is ludicrous.  Anyone who questions why the U.S. Army is still in Korea after 50+ years need only point to Seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north, where he will discover NORTH KOREA. Of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy.  Conspiracy "theory" is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated; it's their sanctuary; but for a scholar of Johnson's caliber to go there is incomprehensible. Unti you see what I saw.  The professional works that I read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free-trade and concluded more-or-less-nothing, all in scholarly language.  For the most part the popular books were  not nominally about globalization at all, although globalization was the only thread holding the books together, and to each other. Brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the 60s ( you underestimate the mustard-gas-like effect of that era at your peril ),the only possible reason for these immensely angry, nonsensical books is this: no one fully understands globalization.  No one. Even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast, too young to tame; growing unpredictably every day like the Blob. They're frustrated, these authors.  I can't blame them, but for some reason they must have a scapegoat and the've rounded up the usual suspect, America, as in why does America impose - dominate - ignore, etc. the third world?  Silly question, really. You're at the top of the food chain, what do they expect you to do? When bad things happen you want to be sure they happen to someone else.  
 I bought the CD since I was going to see Crossfade open up for Alter Bridge and I liked Cold the first couple of times I heard it.  Then I listened to the rest of the CD.  Words can't explain how bad it is.  Cheesy rap-rock with over-used power chords is probably the best description.  The songs all sound the same.  The lyrics border on ridiculous. And to boot, they are even worst in concert.  Most of the people sat and watched them act like kids on stage while a group of 5 high school kids banged their heads to the music.  They have a dj who messes around with turn tables and tries to rap, with the keyword tries.  He is the most pathetic want-a-be that I have ever seen.  After 2 listens, I gave the cd to my little sister who loves Cold.  This is a terrible band and a terrible release 
 Joseph Ellis is a learned, competent Revolutionary era historian. While this book is a fine introduction to Washington's role in the Revolutionary War era and beyond, it doesn't approach the caliber of David McCullough's John Adams or Edmund Morris' The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. Ellis seems to lack the sympathy and insight necessary for a good biography. He doesn't seem to understand Washington - he doesn't get us into his head, relying instead on historical narrative. Ellis also misses opportunities to bring out more of Washington's character. Admittedly, part of the problem of interpreting Washington is that Washington manipulated his public image, acutely aware that it would endure to all generations. The Great W. was scrupulous about his private life. But rather than admitting this paucity of information and pointing to the gaps in our understanding, Ellis attempts to paper it over. His prose style, attempting conversation, yet creaks with scholarly habit. I bought this book, relying on the stellar recommendations here on Amazon, but it seems I must wait for a great tour of the mind of this great leader 
 To endure life's inevitable roadblocks, we have to strive not for perfection, but contentment, and miraculously all the pain will go away -- for a while.  What he calls "curing" I call "coping with."  There is no cure for the hardships we all encounter along the way -- becoming a hermit is even worse, as you dwell on what's wrong.  Ultimately, all pain goes through a "receiving center" in the brain, and seratonin blocks the perception of pain and keeps it from "centralizing" in the nervous system.  In his diatribute to the ability to be pain-free, he refers a lot to his former book, BRAIN LONGEVITY, on which he collaborated with the same journalist who has written for several medical magazines.  He uses many "deficits" for possible causes of chronic pain, but specifically names seratonin as the worst, depending on one's pain tolerance threshold.  He says that women suffer more from chronic pain due to hormonal changes, that two-thirds of all patients at pain clinics are women with migraines.  Back pain is three times more prevelant in women, according to this doctor, and chronic muscle pain is ten times more common among the female sex.  All pain signals ultimately land in the brain, where they trigger thought, emotions, memories, and a complex array of biochemical events aimed at protecting your body from further harm.  With chronic pain, the alarm continues to shriek uselessly long after the physical danger has passed.   Seratonin is the body's single best pain-fighter, more important even than endorphins.  Seratonin deficit is a major culprit.  He emphasizes that suffering is one reaction to pain, but not the only possible reaction -- that it is possible to experience pain without suffering from it.  He admits that all lives contain some pain but, when you can experience it without suffering, "your chronic, disabling pain, for all practical purposes will be 'cured'."  Pain is the most common reason people go to doctors.  Dr. Scott Fishman, president of the American Academy of Pain Management feels, "We've wandered from the basic philosophy in medicine, where you cure what you can but always treat suffering, to being focused only on curing."  In the section about arthritis, he confirms that the side effects pain medications present are worse than the problem they are supposed to relieve.  One example is plain aspirin which, he says destroys the cartilage, the "padding" which keeps bones from rubbing together.  This is the most common type called osteoarthritis.  It is thought that eighty percent have this type by the age of fifty, progressing as age does.  It involves hands, spine, hips, knees and feet (primarily in overweight people), and goes back to the cavemen.  Exercise therapy is touted as a natural substitute for medicine, but I know first hand that this type can cause more pain.  Rheumatoid is a disorder or malfunction of the immune system with more inflammation of the joints.  He says that this is most often in women between 25 and 50, with no known cure.  In this type, you have to learn to "conquer" as opposed to "cure."  He really only stresses what we all know, you just have to live with pain at varying times and in varying intensities.  If you try to follow all of his suggestions, not only would you spend all your time trying to locate and consume numerous herbal supplements and expensive foods, but your money, too.  Mort Crim once remarked, "forgiving someone can't change the past but it can transform the future."  Dr. Khalsa tried out this intensive program at the University of Arizona. I think he must have had all female subjects. It is not recommended to use this as a substitute for medical care, as needed, only as some suppositions.  More research is needed, I feel, and I wonder how long his program lasted.  I feel that traditional Pain Management, similar to what I had at Vanderbilt in Nashville is better -- but there is NO cure for pain.  That's an illusion 
 I cannot recommend this book for several reasons: 1. The premise of the book is specious. There is no true evidence that Brunelleschi and Ghiberti engaged in a "feud". While they certainly competed with each other for the same commissions on occasion, this was completely expected during that period, and ultimately each distinguished himself well as a master artist and craftsman. There is very little evidence that either character attempted to discredit or destroy the other.  2. Because there is little evidence of this feud, the author spends a lot of time using conjecture to argue an ultimately baseless point. Those pages are largely wasted reading. 3. The author's focus detracts from the incredible contribution each of these men made to the Renaissance. Sadly, it's hard to get a sense of that from this book. Brunelleschi may have been the greatest architect in the history of Western civilization. One gets no sense of that from this book. The brilliance of his achievements are largely glossed over. Much of the same can be said for the author's treatment of Ghiberti. It does a disservice to both.  If you have an interest in the dome at Santa Maria della Fiore and/or Ghiberti's doors at the Baptistry on the same site, please read 'Brunelleschi's Dome', by Ross King. It's a very well-researched book and gives the reader a far better view into these two great artists. That book is highly recommended. Sadly, I cannot recommend "The Feud That Sparked the Renaissance" 
 I was so excited about how great this product worked when I got it.  I had purchased the FM transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so I thought since my car had a tape deck I would give this a try.  I was excited that I had all my ipod music with me, BUT after less than a week it the sound  started going down hill to a point where I couldn't listen anymore with it.  It is now in a landfill somewhere.  My guess is I will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable.  For now just have the radio and CDs I burn 
 Before buying this book.  I wish I had.  I was disappointed in this book.  Jane Eyre is one of my favorite novels, I also loved Wide Sargasso Sea, but this book is nowhere close to being as good.  The reason this book failed is that the author tried to write a book that was an extention of Jane Eyre but could also stand alone.  The problem with this is that the person most likely to read this book, fans of Jane Eyre, want to read about familiar characters and make connections to the original story, which this book fails to provide.   Since this story is written by a different person and at a different time, it is understandable that the feel of the book is different, and I did not expect a book that was exactly like Jane Eyre.  However, this book is billed as a companion to Jane Eyre so the author owes it to her readers to make a connection to the original story. Instead the author fails dismally in her attempt to reproduce the original characters.  Every character was wrong and did not resemble the originals.  The author portrayed Adele as a rebelious, scheming, unhappy girl, whereas in Jane Eyre Adele was happy if not resigned to her lot in life.  Even the character of Jane Eyre is not portrayed accurately in this book.  Speaking of accuracy, there are a lot of inaccuracies in this book.  Like others have mentioned, it's almost as if the writer had never read Jane Eyre.  I think the writer chose to ignore certain facts in order to make the original story fit her own.  This is a mistake as anyone who has read Jane Eyre will be annoyed by the inconsistencies.  The grossest inconsistency being (in my mind) was the supposed murder of Bertha before she fell off the roof.  It was made clear in Jane Eyre and earlier in this book that Bertha was seen and heard screaming before she jumped.  Finally, I was most disappointed in the cheesy overwrought soap opera ending.  Mrs. F as a murdering maniac who is so intent an Ingram/Rochester marriage that she kills the first wife and dangles the current wife over a ledge?  Unbelieveable.   Even if I had never read Jane Eyre I still could have not enjoyed this book.  The dark, garbled plot and all the twists and turns make this a difficult read 
 Unless you have nothing else to do (and that includes nothing else ro read), leave this one on the shelf.  This story about a young girl who decides to leave everything and discover the east as well as herself, falls short in every aspect. The plot is not interesting and the e-mails , althought original, are not enough to lift up the storyline. What was for me the biggest drawback of this book is the shallow characters and the abnoctious hero who is simply impossible to relate to in any way. As a non native english speaker i finished this book for the sole purpose of improving my english. There are so many good books out there it is simply not worth the time 
 'The Hellenistic Philosophers, Volume 2: Greek and Latin Texts with Notes and Bibliography' by A. A. Long (ISBN-10: 0521275571} was first published by Cambridge University Press in 1987.  Presumably at that time it was a real book.  In other words, in keeping with the scholarly nature of its contents, it was well-printed on quality paper, had a durable cover, and was stitched so that it would open flat for ease of reference.    Sadly, the present object (which we are informed was "Transferred to digital printing in 2003" and no doubt became much cheaper to manufacture) is none of these things.  The print is blurred, the paper is at best of middling quality, the paper covers are flimsy, and since it comes with a disgusting glued back it cannot be opened flat without cracking the spine.  One wonders what has happened to the sense of honor, to pride in producing a well-made object, and to the desire to give the customer a handsome book at a reasonable price that would last and not disintegrate within a few years?   Although no specialist in Hellenistic philosophy, and therefore no judge of scholarship in this field, the contents of this book seem at least to me to be impeccable, of great interest, and well worth 5 stars. As a physical object, however, this book is a piece of trash that Cambridge University Press ought to be ashamed at putting out, certainly at such a ridiculously high price, and hence the single star 
 don't just automatically hit "not helpful" because you unconditionally love sufjan, think about it. these are b sides, and more of the same. problem with sufjan is, he's brilliant, but not exactly varied. he's beginning to ape himself over and over again with similar time signatures, arrangements, and all slowly evolving towards the charm of a book report. Would like to see Sufjan stop the cloying/cutesie states project and sing about something personal to himself rather than the construction of a ferris wheel in Illinoi 
 What a disappointment. After reading the great reviews on Amazon, I was very much looking forward to this book.   After reading one chapter though, I went to the Internet to do a little research -- I was sure this book must be self-published, as it reads more like a term paper than like a professionally edited book about autism and ADHD. In fact, what I found is that publisher WaterBrook Press is "an autonomous evangelical religious publishing division of Random House." OK, that would explain the bible quotes. I would've preferred to know that before I bought this book. But to be fair, the religious overtones are fairly innocuous. No, my real problem is that I don't believe the publisher/editor has any deep understanding of the subject, and therefore didn't hold this book to the same standards that Future Horizons or JKP would have.  I DO believe that the connection between ADD/ADHD and Autism/Asperger needs to be delved into. Unfortunately, this book doesn't do a very good job of it. While the author points out the many things that ADHD and autism/Asperger Syndrome have in common, she virtually ignores their differences (e.g. an aspie's intense resistence to change, or their preoccupation with specific subjects -- very defining elements of the disorder). If this was the only book you read about autism and asperger, you'd come out with a very poor understanding of those diagnoses 
 Very wobbly, and sharp edges on the edges of the shelves.  I cut myself bad enough to require stitches on the underside of the shelf.  I don't recommend 
 We recently purchased this book in anticipation of a trip to the Outer Banks (as I am sure anyone looking at this is considering doing). The book was a useful tool but we did encounter some problems.  First, I'll mention what they got right: the book is very comprehensive and all the various categories (lodging, attractions, et cetera) are grouped by the town they are in. This was useful as we would spend a day or two in a town and then move on to another. We found the accomodations section especially helpful as we did not make reservations in advance. The hotels we stayed at were all acceptable (and as described in the book) and the price ranges in the book reflected the real world cost.  But this guide is not without its faults. While we did not run into any trouble with our lodging, the blurbs in the guide about each hotel do not appear to be written by people who stayed at the hotel but read more like the literature a hotel would give out. I am not sure how the hotel reviews were gathered but they really read more like advertisements than reviews.  Finally, where the guide really steered us wrong (and a big reason why I think the bulk of the "reviews" are just blurbs received from the owners of the establishments) was with the Native American Museum. The guide described this as a very nice visit and one where admission would be $2 per person. Well, when we got there it was $5. Furthermore, when we made the mistake of going inside, we found anything but an enjoyable time. The building is a crowded mismash of items with no explanation for their appearance there. One closest-like enclosure contains three glass cases of various head gear. I particularly enjoyed seeing the Maryland State police baseball cap. Of course there was no explanation for why such a hat would be on display. Alas, the baseball cap was behind glass so I couldn't touch this important relic. The MD police cap is indicative of the whole experience. After winding through all these clutter, we came to a television set in the basement with nothing but static. It truly felt like the beginning of a bad horror movie. Avoid this scam at all costs.  Given that the reviews of attractions are, at best, not very critical, and, at worst, advertisements sent in by the owners, I would suggest picking up a different guide, getting literature from the visitor's center in Kitty Hawk (very helpful folks there) or asking around when you get there. We found the Cape Hatteras lighthouse (and the climb to the top) especially enjoyable. We also found the Duke of Dare motel in Manteo to be an inexpensive alternative to some of the larger hotels. Also, the Oregon Inlet has a great public swimming area that was never crowded. Enjoy your trip 
 I had to read this book for my college history course in World History.  The book gave good factual events from an American who had gone to Russia during the five year plan in Stalin's regime.  This book is an autobiographical account of an American man's life and marriage in Russia, yet I did not enjoy the deep amount of factual literature that was implemented into the book, since the author did not let the reader become intimate with his personal life or feelings.  I felt that this book was more of a textbook than a novel.  However, I believe that professors will most likely assign this book for their students, especially for the topic of the five year plan, due to the amount of historical and factual content embedded into the story 
 I really don't see how anyone can say that William Carlos Williams' "The Red Wheelbarrow" is an outstanding peice of work. I'm not going to trash the rest of his work because I find some of it to be quite good, but I would love to know how on earth that poem got published. I find it pointless and quite frankly, boring. And how people get three-page analyses of this poem leaves me in utter amazement that there actually are people with no life 
 As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel.  I give it 3 stars for holding my attention.  A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past.  The one star is a mistake and I cannot seem to change it.   3 ***  stars 
 Despite the cult status that has grown up around him, Fitzgerald was not nearly the artist Hemingway was.  Most of this fiction was written for  money, and it's obvious: it's far too slick, too self-consciously snappy to  qualify as art.  I rather like Fitzgerald's dictum that one should write  for the youth of his generation, the schoolteachers of the next, and the  critics of all time.  Trouble is, that same youthfulness and obsession with  being au courant is the work's strength and its greatest limitation.   Perhaps because of this self-declared aim, much of the work now seems  hopelessly dated, naive, and surprisingly racist.  Still, part of their  "charm," if that's the right word, is the stories' evocation of an era.   More than a handful of them together, though, begins to feel like the  script to a Fred Astaire movie like Top Hat, and the effervescence -- like  the bubbles in champagne -- begins to cloy after a few glasses.    I've had  teachers who say that one doesn't care about Fitzgerald's characters.  I'm  not sure that's true.  What I DO feel may be true, especially after reading  Max Perkins, Editor of Genius (a great biography that will make the "lost  generation" the bulk of your reading list for some time to come), is that  Fitzgerald never really grew up, never really developed a sense of what  people were like, or what their deepest concerns were.  I also suspect that  he wasn't especially bright: there's a lot of pseudo-intellectualism on  display throughout.  Fitzgerald's characters seem shallow perhaps because  the times were, but also, I begin to think,  because Fitzgerald himself was  unable to supply the depth of understanding and wisdom required of the best  artists.  In the end, like the strikingly handsome figures of his day, he  cuts quite a figure, but leaves little in the way of a lasting impression.   Of course, with any writer of Fitzgerald's stature, there are a few gems,  among them "The Ice Palace," "Jacob's Ladder" and "A Captured Shadow."  On  the other hand, a story like "More Than Just a House" is more illustrative  of the vast majority here: while the story proceeds very well for a while,  somehow it never quite adds up to much, and I can't help  wondering if this  is one of the endings Fitzgerald "altered" for the Saturday Evening Post,  as he confesses to Hemingway in "A Moveable Feast."  For the most part,  these stories give a reader none of what one wants in the best of  literature.  They're just diversions, and seem such a waste of talent and  time.  Far from revealing "A vastly new and amplified Fitzgerald," as the  blurb of some dim reviewer intones on the book's cover, this collection of  stories confirms that all but a handful are hackwork, as was the prevailing  opinion of most critics up to this point anyway.  Sadly, nothing in this  collection seems destined to change that 
 Kane seems to think there is some irony in titling his book "Savages", but instead it adds to the racist overtones found in his faux anthropological approach to his "field work". The oversimplifications found in this book are upsetting to those of us who spend years working with native populations, and this book does little to halt harmful visions of native peoples.  This is an ecotourist approach to a complex culture and we are left with more questions than answers, and this book in many ways capitalizes on the plight of these people 
 A bit of a disappointment. Anecdotal and reflective, but not really informative about how the process of creativity works. A little bit scholarly and pedantic 
 Living Things is very disappointing. The previous CD, Kimi Ga Suki Raifu, was such a powerful collection of songs, written and recorded with such clarity and immediacy, a rock classic that is truly one of his best efforts alongside Girlfriend. Living Things is touted as Sweet's return to a fully produced, thought-out album. It even has Van Dyke Parks...so it must be a slice of Wilson-esque classic pop, like In Reverse...right? There's only one problem: the songs. Living Things rings very hollow musically, and lyrically it is hopelessly bleak, the actual opposite feeling of the album's title. This is not a sunny pop album, it is a dark series of resignations on the hopelessness of life, with almost none of Sweet's humor to balance out the darkness. It just feels like a bad head trip. I have listened intently to this disc, in various settings and states of mind, and have come up short every time. The material is lacking a heart, a center of gravity. Yes, it has all the external elements of Sweet's pop sheen: the overlaid vocals, the guitar textures, the power pop grooves. On the surface, it all sounds attractive, but underneath all the layers is empty, bleak music. It feels like "Matthew Sweet by the numbers."   Moreover, Living Things is supposed to be a more "produced" album than Kimi Ga Suki, and yet it feels sloppy and unrehearsed. Only a couple of the songs have a proper "ending" or even a fade-out. Most of the tracks sound like demos, with haphazard sloppy endings where the music abruptly cuts off as if the band were only rehearsing the song and decided to quit before the end. This is not a well produced album, to be honest it sounds unprofessional. And the fact that there is no booklet, no lyrics, also shows that Matthew wanted to put this CD out "on the cheap," which shows some disregard for his fans, in my opinion. Girlfriend, Altered Beast, 100% Fun, In Reverse, all of these discs have always had some form of lyric booklet. Even with Kimi Ga Suki Raifu, there was a booklet with liner notes by Matthew, a sense of personal involvement. But on Living Things, nothing. Just the tracklist and personnel. I detect a disinterest on Sweet's part, a lack of concern for our reaction to the sloppy song endings, the redundant material, or the lack of any liner notes or lyrics. Matthew seems essentially absent from the whole operation, from the packaging to the songs.    One reviewer compared this album to Altered Beast, which also had a more densely layered production style, a more "experimental" album than, say, Girlfriend. But at least Altered Beast still had a very high calibre of songs: Dinosaur Act, Ugly Truth, Time Capsule, Life Without You, Reaching Out, Falling. There is nothing on Living Things that stands out as a memorable song in the end. It all sounds like a series of hooks and textures that don't go anywhere. Another example of a more "produced" Sweet album is 1999's In Reverse, which has the Spector/Wilson "Wall of Sound" production on some tracks, but again, it works well because Sweet wrote a solid collection of SONGS for that album. Hide, Split Personality, I Should Never Have Let You Know, Write Your Own Song. These are all true gems in Sweet's catalog. And once again, Living Things fails to produce even ONE song that rises above the surface exterior in order to make a lasting impression. Really, I cannot think of even one song that stands on its own merits. "You're Not Sorry" and "I Saw Red" are probably the "best" tracks, but even those songs only sound like hollow imitations of much stronger material by Sweet on previous albums. He's covered all of this ground before, with much better results. For an album called "Living Things," it all sounds lifeless, a collection of dead shells. Attractive containers with nothing inside. 
 See the rare spectacle of Sean Connery covered in mud (or chocolate pudding) while maintaining a straight face! Hear Brian Keith's contrived Russian accent! Experience some of the worst special effects in film history! "Meteor" gives new meaning to the term "disaster movie." Unfortunately, a better-than-necessary cast is trapped in the wreckage -- including Henry Fonda as the President of the United States. Good for a few unintentional laughs 
 I used this guide for a recent 14-day trip with friends to Granada, Costa del Sol, and Madrid. It was not at all helpful--and several times, the book's recommendations were completely off base. We will not use Frommer's again 
 I bought this kettle in February 2006. I liked everything about it until its automatic ON-OFF switch died recently - only two months after the purchase. Now the kettle won't turn on. It wasn't abused in any way, and these kettles usually last for years and years. The last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new Proctor Silex K4070.   I wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique? Has anyone else had one with a short-lived switch, or was I unlucky?  
 Comon people listen to some music with soul and meaning.  Buy Guns 'N Roses Use your Illusion albums.  They rock and they'll blow you away musically.  They have guys who play their own instruments in it, and play them very well.  Please don't let music like this reign the charts anymore.  It is a scam by the record companies for them to make s**tloads of money.  They give you this sleek "appealing" commercial trash used to fool you and get YOUR MONEY!!!  These guys are not musicians!  Please listen to real music.  Their are starving musicians everywhere around the world who deserve to get paid before these little droids do.  
 My 16 month old LOVES Elmo and Sesame Street so I was very surprised at his reaction to this DVD.  When the Big Bad Wolf blew away Prairie Dawn and the camera, he started screaming and crying and climbing all over me (like the wolf was "getting him").  I try to remember to fast-forward past this part but sometimes forget.  He knows the scene is coming several scenes before and climbs in my lap for protection.  This comes from a child who has NEVER been frightened by anything on TV.  Also, my 2 1/2 year old neice was afraid of the very scary tornado in the weather segment.  This DVD may be appropriate for older childrn, but definitely not for toddlers 
 This is not a rating of the magazine - just a warning to check your Wish List address if you "wish" for magazines.  My son changed his address in his Amazon account when he moved 2 years ago within the same city. Amazon did not use this information to update his address within his Wish List. When I ordered $138 worth of magazines from his wish list last December, Amazon hid the street address "for privacy" - therefore I could not know the magazines would be sent to the wrong address.  In November, I asked my son if he'd like to have these magazines renewed and he said he had never received any!  After I spoke with Amazon, my son now gets a message when he goes to his Wish List that his address doesn't match the one in his account, so it's clear Amazon is now aware of this problem.  The publisher will not redo this Communication Arts subscription, saying the magazines were never returned to them, and Amazon has not responded to my request for a refund 
 Maxwell's concepts of what a leader is is quite accurate.  However, I don't think he needed to spend over 200 pages to define what a leader is.  That's what this book came to be: one long, repetitive, obvious definition for leadership.  I didn't see these as laws so much as nuances of what he'd already said.  As a woman, reading this book was made more difficult with his overwhelming use of sports and male leaders.  The few examples he uses of female leaders are the few and the cliched (ex., Mother Teresa and Princess Diana).  A nun and a princess.  How many women in business are either of those?  Where are the examples strong, successful, inspiring female business and sports leaders?  I also found his use of his religious roles and examples tiresome.  What I felt that this book lacked most was more suggestions to improve one's leadership skills?  He suggests training, but not what kind nor does he provide exercises for developing oneself as a leader.  Another failure of this book is how he rarely addresses how a strong leader should deal with situations that aren't going well.  A great leader's abilities are best exemplified and most apparent in times of conflict.  I also strongly disagree that a positional leader isn't necessarily a true leader.  A positional leader is in nature a leadership role.  What isn't inherent in a positional leader is her or his ability to lead *well*?  One of the elements of this book I did appreciate were the pictures and quotes and the fact that the book is a quick read.  Other than that, I don't feel any more prepared now than I did prior to reading this book 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 This product's write-up says it's both PC and Mac compatible. This is not true in any fashion. On a Mac, it will either freeze your machine on the start up of the app. or it will not install at all. We tried to install it on six different Macs (different ages, laptop, tower, G3, G4). It would not run on any of these extremely well-maintained machines - all of them exceeded the minimum system requirements outlined on the Suze Orman box. We tried every trick we knew to get it to work (restarting, one button/two button mouse, copying to the desktop, etc.) This thing will not run on a Mac. We called Suze's tech support and they offered the obvious solution of "try clicking it again real fast". When, of course, that didn't work their only other solution/brush-off was an offer to refund (if we could supply all the appropriate paperwork). I was prepping for a trip. I didn't need a dozen dollars back. I needed to put my affairs in order before flying. I'd already waited over a week for the thing to arrive. Suze's tech people did admit that there had been some difficulties running the software on "newer Macs". Well, we went back as far as the system requirements allowed. This does not run on a Mac. Buy something else 
 This is a review for normal people. If you are a fan of standard fiddle do not buy this CD. It is a bunch of badly recorded, half hearted, boring and sloppy songs thrown together on an overpriced CD. Save yourself $... or if you like this type of music just go buy some old Little Rascals episodes on DVD. Then you will get the same music you hear on this plus the bonus of the Little Rascals. Now I know why we think of Blues guitar players not fiddle players when this music is discussed. The other reviewers seem to think some of the names on this CD will be familiar to you. Don't believe them, unless names like "Abrew's Portuguese Instrumental Trio" or "Dixieland Jug Blowers" are familiar to you. I am just hoping to prevent normal music lovers from stepping into this pile and losing $... like I did. I play banjo, fiddle, mandolin, dulcimer and guitar all badly, but I could get a gig with these bands and probably improve their sound. If you are the artsy type that digs this kind of stuff and you can't wait to grow a goatee, turn the lights down low, fill the room with smoke (oops, bad for your health), put your sunglasses on and crank this baby up; I hope you don't mind being stuck by yourself all the time because no one else is going to put up with this lousy music. Go find something with Chubby Wise in it if you want to hear some real fiddle playing. Help support some little known, up and coming fiddle players that need to buy food and pay rent with royalty checks by buying their music instead of making these labels, that get this junky music for free or almost free, super rich 
 I wanted to love this book because I think the theory of how stress affects the body is sound. However, I could not love this book because although the books seems to show connection between stress and frailties or illness in the body, it fails to  help us learn how to effect change and find solutions.  It is filled with many discouraging examples of patients with extraordinary problems, but not with success stories, not with stories of achievement, not with stories of people beating these problems, not with solutions that could turn the tables in the favor of the patient. Knowing a problem is one thing, and I believe most of us who purchase this book already believe the connection of stress and disease exists, however, we really need tools and solutions to understand how to change things. It could have been a great book, a best selling book, if that was included. I'm extremely disappointed. 
 All i know is that if anyone says anything about Ashkenazi Jews, they are demonized as hatemongers and anti-semitic.  look up the word anti semitic, and one discovers that arabs are also " semitic"  only people who are from the tribe of judah are jews ( different story) and the turkish europeans who converted to the religion are not remotely connected to ancient israel.  also zionism is distinctly different from Judaism,   ie, trotsky baruch perle wolfiwitz etc, and needs to be stopped   sorry ford was right 
 I bought this product in order to remove the scratches from my iPod. After using it exactly as directed, which involved large amounts of scrubbing with an unpleasant smelling goo, the scratches were still on my iPod. The iPod was shinier, I admit, but if you want a shiny iPOd you could probably use a wet cloth and get the same results. The miracle sounding 'gets rid of all scratches' is competely untrue. Not even the small scratches disappeared 
 What a waste of time and money. 10 songs and hardly 20-30 minutes... of pure mediocrity.   Weezer is an amazing band...just don't bother on this one folks. Pinkerton and the Blue album are just classics. I Respect those guys a whole lot.  This is just...disappointing to say the least. It's just BAD, even for a Weezer fan. Lately Weezer has been trying to do with their nerd-rock label and are going for an almost loveable, adorable sort cutesy label.  I can't make myself clear enough. Don't go near this album, it's just the bottom of the corporate barrel. 
 I wasn't too impressed about this book as many other reviewers were. The only positive thing I can say about this book is for its style. Obviously, Leo Tolstoy is well-known for his novel epics, WAR AND PEACE, and ANNA KARENINA, and also for his short stories (some which I've read and enjoyed). But from reading this book I didn't really see that brilliant storyteller. The book is more like a biography about a fictional character and his death than an actual story. Of course we as the reader get the universal ideas of death (such as "better him than me" attitude, "Why do i deserve to die this way God?" etc.), and as someone who has recently overcome the lost of a family member, I can relate. But to me I found this book boring and pointless to read (thank goodness it was a NOVELLA!). I don't really see how other reviewers gave this book 5 stars. I mean it was a well-written book and all, but nothing worth bragging about, and it's definitely NOT Tolstoy's best work. 
 Well this was my third book by Mr. Eco and dthe continue to get worse. The Rose was excellent and made me hungry for more but after the Pendulum and this Hyper-Realty bit I'm going to have to call it quits. The author has the ability t oput together a great novel such as the Rose, I wish it were mine, but the other stuff is just not happening 
 One of the reviewers below stated that admirers of Hurston "won't be disappointed" by this book. I beg to differ: I've read pretty much everything Hurston has written, and I think she is without a doubt one of the best American (and perhaps world) writers of the twentieth century. But "Seraph" was a great disappointment. Hurston simply overreached with this one. By the time I had finished reading it, I found myself wondering what the point of this book was. The story follows the marriage of a Florida couple over several decades. The husband is ambitious and forceful, yet also arrogant and sometimes violent, while the wife is timid and (overly) sensitive. Told from the wife's point of view, the problem with the story is that it essentially goes from a more or less realistic give-and-take between the two to an account of how she tries to prove herself worthy of her husband (there is little in the way of growth on his part by the way, e.g. he never expresses any regret for having acted like a brute during the early years of their marriage). Thus, "Seraph on the Suwanee" basically reads like a romance novel. It's true that anthropologist Hurston provides some interesting details into the lives of the "Florida crackers" (i.e. poor southern whites) in the early 20th century, but this is hardly enough to compensate for the novel's weaknesses. It's hard to believe that the literary genius who wrote "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (among other excellent books) could produce such a lackluster wor 
 I found this book to be horrifying in its concentration on feeling empathy for a man who killed his parents, his wife and his children. He robbed, cheated and lied his way through life and the author wants us to care about him? No attempt was made in this book to cause us to care about his victims. Even while he is in prison he cons his way but we are supposed to accept his behavior because he reads the bible and professes to love Jesus.     I might have been able to enjoy the book if it were well written. I found the writing mundane and non-engrossing. If the author wanted to interest me in the main character he shoud have stayed with him instead of trying to make the author's connection with the conman a part of the story. I found no facts in the book that I had not already read in earlier newspaper accounts. If you must read it pick it up in a dustbin. I do not understand the praise it has received 
 After my older brother suddenly died of coronary artery disease at age 40 due to genetically high cholesterol, I needed to learn everything possible on the subject so that I could avoid suffering the same fate.  I read all the books on the shelf, among them Dr. Ornish's.  I disliked this book because it is rather narcissistic and is focused more on Dr. Ornish himself than on educating us about how to avoid heart disease.  Take a look at chapter 1 and you'll see what I mean: "I was trained to treat hypertension..."; "I first became interested in conducting research on heart disease in 1975..."; "I began to wonder..."; "I went to the medical library and began reading extensively"; "It seemed like an exciting opportunity, so in 1977 I decided to take a year off..."; "I hadn't had enough clinical experience to be jaded..."; "I was unwittingly giving many of them hope for the first time since their illness had been diagnosed"; "I went back to medical school and graduated in 1980"; "From 1981 to 1984, I completed my internship and medical residency in Boston."; "In July 1984, I moved to San Francisco..."  This is just the tedious first six pages.  Trust me, it goes on and on like this.  Do you want to learn about how the heart works?  You'll finally get a few sentences on that subject when you get to page 42, squeezed in between more "I did this and I did that."  You'll get a little info on LDL and HDL when you get to page 51.  Sure, there is useful information within the 672 pages of this book, but you'll be forced to become an expert on Dr. Ornish and his life story to find it.  And remember, this book is more than 15 years old.  Perhaps back in 1990 he needed to devote 300 pages to convincing people that he was correct in believing that diet, exercise, and stress affect your risk of heart disease, but that that is common knowledge and not controversial now.  The research is far more advanced in today's world.  If you are interested in Dr. Ornish personally and the history of the study of heart disease in the 1970s and 1980s, you'll probably enjoy this book.  But if you are serious about educating yourself on heart disease and how best to avoid it, I would recommend Dr. Robert Superko's "Before the Heart Attacks : A Revolutionary Approach to Detecting, Preventing, and Even Reversing Heart Disease" (2003) or Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz's "The Expert Guide to Beating Heart Disease: What You Absolutely Must Know" (2005).  These books are more up to date and provide far more useful information. 
 In reading this book I had high hopes that it would be about empowering women or at the very least celebrating the sexual side of womanhood. I found it a rather juvenile  boring read and the course language in poor taste 
 I am a big fan of Miike's work. "Happiness of the Katakuris" is an irresistible, charming work of art. Similarly, "Audition" is a chilling cautionary-tale. But "Ichi the Killer" is not as engaging as Miike's other films . . . many people will try to convince you otherwise though:)  Foremost, it must be noted that much of the gore is laughable (intentionally) . . . the face sliding down the wall, the tongue being severed, the pimp being "split" . . . funny stuff, I admit!! Moreover, it does not appear that Miike was overly concerned about these moments appearing "realistic" (most of his films have a "dreamlike" quality). Granted, the suspension scene and subsequent scalding solicited a fairly visceral response . . . which was pretty impressive! One other aspect of the film is ALL TOO REAL . . . check IMDB for a horrific bit of trivia on the opening sequence!! (I cannot mention it here!!)  I noticed that some people are complaining about the over-dubbing. Leave it to Americans to select the over-dubbing option!! When you select over-dubbing, you obscure artist-intent . . . you destroy the tone of the film . . . if you are watching a film in a language with which you are unfamiliar, it is your obligation to READ the subtitles. So, stop embarrassing the rest of us and click that "subtitle" button.   The plot is pretty convoluted (which is not necessarily a failing point), so it may require more than one viewing . . . or, at the very least, pay close attention during the initial screening. SPOILER: Nonetheless, the plot is a bit of a Palahniuk rehash. So, the ending should not surprise the viewer (even though it was intended to).   This is a tough call. While many claim this piece is "one of the most violent films in existence," they fail to acknowledge that Miike's work is amusing (again, intentionally!!) So, it is not that this is a TENSE film that has you on "the edge of your seat."  Personally, I thought it was a little tedious (I actually fast-forwarded through segments).   I gave this film one star . . . simply because I feel it would be dishonest to inflate the rating. It is not a "good" film by any set of standards (even unconventional ones!!) STILL, if you love Miike's other films, watch this one . . . just so you can see this man's tremendous RANGE!! And so you can engage in this debate! 
 This book is extremely superficial and obviously the author didn't do very much research.  I also got the CD, An Evening with Dorothy Fields, that was recorded live in 1972 (highly recommended).  Winer has quoted verbatim a lot of what is said on the CD without putting quotation marks around it.  Winer's book tells virtually nothing of Fields' personal life apart from the occasional bombshell like "she was now married a second time since her first marriage had been from the very beginning a mistake acknowledged by both parties [that's a vague paraphrase]" or "now the mother of two children, Dorothy had to..." or later on, "her drinking, always a problem, had gotten worse."  There is no elaboration on any of these points.  But the book does provide a broad overview of her career, even though a few of her films may have gone unmentioned.  I wanted to know more about the person who wrote those easy-to-sing and easy-to-remember lyrics.  Writers and publishers take note: There really ought to be a more in-depth biography of Dorothy Fields.  She is too important a figure of the 20th Century American cultural landscape to be ignored.  THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET isn't much, but right now it's all we have.  Until the definitive biography comes along, it will have to do 
 Due to Sharon Olds' ambiguous subjects, it is difficult to know if she is talking about a child or a lover. I was assigned this book in college, and my classmates and I jokingly referred to it as "kiddie porn." Half of the class thought she was sensually admiring her lover's genitals, while the other half insisted she was lovingly watching her children grow. I am not sure if she intentionally created a vague subject, but I felt dirty after reading this book 
 NO STARS!  I recently have come to find that not only does this coffee maker have all of the defects others have stated, but due to the "leaking" & issues w/ the filter basket overflowing, you may also notice that the water never completely drains-staying at the 2 cup line-causing MOLD & MILLDEW to grow (DESPITE proper cleaning & maintenance).  This is the reason for the "bad tasting coffee" & also the reason for my current various medical conditions...  I am interested in raising awareness so that other consumers avoid the health issues I am being faced with.  PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE ANY MR. COFFEE/SUNBEAM PRODUCTS...  THIS IS THE EXACT MODEL I OWN, BUT NEARLY EVERY MODEL, HAS THE SAME DEFECTIVE CONSTRUCTION & consumer complaints...  Check the Better Business Bureau & Consumer Affairs...  You will be shocked at what you find about Mr. Coffee/Sunbeam.  They have almost gone bankrupt from Class Action Lawsuits, more than once.  If ANYONE has a similar situation with ANY Mr. Coffee brand coffee makers, please contact me ASAP...  My email address is angidougherty@yahoo.com  People are suffering because of this hazardous product & may not even know it...  Toxic Mold Poisoning is very serious & can be deadly.  Especially through drinking it in your morning coffee.  YUM 
 This may hold some appeal for die hard running fans, since the passages about and in reference to the sport are the best written and most interesting in the book.  However, this apparently self-published novel is as short on originality as it is heavy on a plethora of pop culture references and hokey, contrived dialogue.  While the author is obviously a devoted and passionate runner himself, there is little here to keep a reader involved in the short, soap operatic chapters.  It could also have benefitted from better editing, containing numerous punctuation errors and misspellings 
 In a sense, it's sort of silly to try and write anything useful about a book so completely hyped by critics and carefully studied (cf. New Essays on Call it Sleep), but I'm going to anyway, because I didn't like it. Now, to be totally up front, I read it under a certain amount of duress. My book group picked it, and after the first ten pages I decided I wasn't going to read it and would miss the discussion for the first time in four years. However, it happened that at the exact same time, I started a research project in which I needed to learn about Manhattan in 1916. Since that's just a year or so after when this novel is set, I realized I could kill two birds with one stone -- and so I went ahead and read it.  In hindsight, I realize that I should have skipped the introduction by Alfred Kazin which appears in my edition. It gives away almost every significant plot point and plants far too much in the reader's head -- I cannot conceive of why it wasn't the afterword. Plussing as which, it's not a great essay, even a light skim of it will reveal at least one logical flaw and a total misreading of a scene from the book. So, skip the introduction until after you've read the story. And that story is basically the heavily autobiographical inner life of a emotionally damaged 8-year-old Jewish kid in a rapidly modernizing New York. Many like to laud this book as the best novel about the immigrant experience ever written. This seems rather a strange proposition, for while one of the central themes is certainly the boy's attempt to discover an identity in this brave new world, his circumstance is far from typical. First of all, the Jewish immigrant experience in New York is a very particular one, especially as it relates to cultural persecution in the old world and the notion of alienation and always being "the other". Trying to say the "New York Jewish immigrant experience" is representative of the "immigrant experience" in general is clearly ridiculous. Secondly, by their own choices and actions, the boy's family is almost completely cut off from their fellow immigrants, and are hardly representative. Indeed, it's almost refreshing to find a depiction of immigrants whose hardships are largely of their own making.   The boy protagonist is a particularly irksome guide to this world, as he is the ultimate mama's boy (although not without reason). One of the running menacing subplots is the question of whether or not his father is truly his biological father or not, and what exactly his mother got up to in the old country that led to her being married off to a brute of a man (elements apparently drawn from Roth's own childhood). The bulk of the book concerns the boy's horrendous struggle both to assimilate into the world around him and to decipher the spiritual world. The former is a reasonably well-told and familiar portrait of an outsider who just doesn't "get it". The latter fills the book with religious symbolism, which remained largely a mystery to me owing to my utter lack of religious education and knowledge. Clearly, readers with a strong understanding of Judaism and Christianity will certainly find plenty to chew on. The sexual realm is another running theme, and one that's treated with a great deal of angst, confusion, and negativity. This takes on an entirely different aspect if you read the book knowing that Roth, as his biographer so gently puts it, "indulged in incest" with his sister Rose (and a cousin) for several years during his early teen years. A less sugar-coated way of putting it is that he sexually abused and raped his little sister for several years... This is hardly incidental to the book, as his biographer writes: "Roth would ultimately recognize that incest was the engine that drove his composition." Roth's tortured soul comes through very clearly in his younger alter ego, and it's not a pretty sight.   The style and language used are certainly distinctive, and doubtless many find it invigorating and affecting -- I did not. Roth was rather famously influenced by Joyce, Eliot, and other modernists, and I just happen not to care for modernism. The stream of consciousness employed to depict the boy's inner terrors is effective in moderation, but each passage of it runs on far too long, almost to the point of parody. Similarly, much has been written about Roth's representation of Yiddish and the phonetic treatment of English in the book, but neither has aged particularly well. The stylistic flourishes, epithets, and distinctive syntax of Yiddish which Roth employs are difficult to read without simultaneously "hearing" them as farce or parody of the Mel Brooks variety. There are a great deal of detailed descriptive passages, which again, may appeal to those who appreciate the writer as still-life artist, but again, these struck no chord with me.  So, I freely admit that many of my reasons for not liking the book are personal, however I doubt I am alone in this (as indeed I wasn't in my book group). It simply did not resonate with me on any level, and I can't say I'm the richer for having read it. Others certainly will be though, especially those with an interest in Jewish-American literature or literature about New York 
 I just returned mine. It leaked -- just as others have reported. Twice the top fell off while I was pouring my martini. The first time I thought I must have put it on too loosely. The second time I knew it was not anything I did. Its a shame that such a well designed utensil has such poor quality control 
 I really didn't like this book to say the least.  I didn't like the way it was written.  I didn't like the story line at all.  None of it made much of any sense and much of it seemed to contradict some basic Jedi guidelines.  I was looking forward to reading this I thought it would go more into the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin a few years after Episode 1.  I thought it might include some insight on Padawan training.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Overall it was a really stupid story that wasn't at all believable, even in the realm of the Star Wars universe.  Just bad.  It does have a couple relevant story lines that you might want to know if you plan on or do read all the Star Wars books published. I would only read this if you are one of those people, otherwise I would definitely recommend skipping this one 
 This book is old news and is filled with predictions for 2005 & 2006 - most of which are inacurate.  His boom and subsequent bust theories are not materializing - and at this point even if they do will be of much smaller scale than his grand predictions (DOW over 40,000) presented in this book 
 Fifteen minutes hadn't passed during this movie before I stopped watching.  Aside from being one of those movies you know they write the scripts for in five minutes, I was shocked to find scenes STOLEN directly from Terminator 2, with simply a change of characters and music.  It doesn't matter if they were given permission to or not, such a lack of effort and creativity deserves no merit.  Do not even watch 
 Buddhist math? C'mon.  First, let me say that fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are great tools. They're valued parts of the 'soft logic' kit that includes probability, interval arithmetic, Bayesian and Markov networks, and lots of other good stuff. Fuzziness involves many of the formal techniques used in probability and elsewhere, and gives a useful, alternative view of the systems it addresses.  The basic fuzzy idea is that most descriptions involve shades of gray, that few systems really match the black/white, on/off, either/or duality of standard formal logic. That's fine, I can get along with that quite well.   My problem, though, is that Kosko presents the fuzzy world-view vs. the traditional or "scientific" in exactly the black and white terms that he rejects. He also argues that fuzziness describes the world more effectively than "scientific" terms, that the rules of arithmetic, probability, and calculus are just games. They are played for their internal consistency, not because differentiation or factorials occur in nature.  That's true, and as a heavy math user I know enough to distinguish my models from reality. Two facts remain, though. First, the models very often do describe reality in ways that can be checked easily enough: the bridge doesn't fall down and the TV receives its signal. Both happen because the bad old exact arithmetic has some kind of correspondence (no, I don't know what) to the real world, giving real ability to predict real results. Second, fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are themselves mathematical formalisms, games like all the others. Once you get past the gee-whiz stage, there is mathematical content as rigorous as in any other field of study. It's not either/or, it's very often a different way to interpret the same self-consistent games people have played for years. It adds interesting rules to the game.  The great thing is that you really can use the new interpretations and tools along with the old ones. Fuzziness doesn't demolish the old structures, it bolsters them and adds capacity.   And you can get all these benefits without shrink-wrapped, bite-sized pieces of Eastern philosophy.  //wiredweir 
 Glad I just recorded this from TV, because boredom set in fairly quickly and then I just fast forwarded, and saw the ending. It's now erased. Life is too short to sit through junk like this 
 I guess I missed the point. I can see how this film could be considered a horror "classic". I'm sure the violence was ground breaking in 1972... in fact, one of the comments in the "making of" on this dvd was that teenagers were actually throwing up in the theatres. I don't think it's a well done film overall... it's lacking in story, music, direction, and suspense. The acting is not too bad, but could have been more intense and believable in some scenes. If I was craving some good 1970's horror, I'd rather watch "I Spit on Your Grave" or "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" 
 Yeah, it's the Arms & Equipment book for the 3.0 and probably the 3.5 series unless Wizards decides to update it to 3.5 with new wacky items. Basically the book is a little handbook of mercenaries and followers, gadgets like spyglasses and wacky little knives that your characters hold in between thier fingers, and other strange equipment like that. There's also rules for mounts and vehicles. However, this information is fine and dandy but I couldn't justify paying the price the Wizards wants for this book for some wacky gadgets and expanded rules that are already explained in the PHB and DMG. If you have the extra cash, or someone is looking to give you a gift, ask for this book but don't expect much. But if you're spending your own hard earned cash, look somewhere else. This isn't like the 2nd edition Arms & Equipment book that gave rules for cool thief tools and castles. It's just a DM guide to wacky gadgets, vehicles, and mounts. Oh yeah, and how to hire hirelings and mercenaries. Whatever...

 Daniel Pipes said about this book:  "With uncommon skill, Shlaim has managed-in the confines of a very small volume with very large margins-to pack misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense into 1994's worst book on the Middle East."  Well, is that true?  Probably.  But just to show everyone that I am not only tolerant and soft-hearted, but generous, I'll give this book not just one, but two stars!    You see, there are plenty of facts in this small book.  In addition to the misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense which it does indeed abound with.  Shlaim claims that the 1973 Yom Kippur War broke the diplomatic stalemate in the region and led to peace.  He's not the only one to have said this.  But I wouldn't consider saying something like this on a dare.  I'd be laughed out of town!   Could I say with a straight face that the way to start negotiations towards peace is to launch a war of aggression against a neighbor?  No.  And just how strong is the peace between Egypt and Israel anyway?  Not very.  It is more a cease-fire than a peace, with a constant barrage of anti-Israeli propaganda from the Egyptian side.  After that, we see Shlaim explain that land-poor Israel can have territory or peace.  Really?  I think it is more reasonable for those who want peace to permit land-poor nations to buy or keep something closer to their fair share of land.  In my opinion, Israel is more likely to have both territory and peace or neither of them than one or the other.  And the author says that Israel can have territory or American support.  Again, this could well be a false choice.  Even if Israel, for some reason, can not have both American support and territory, why ought one expect it to have American support if it does not have territory?  Shlaim sums up the problem of the Arabs versus the Jews.  Security pleases the Jews.  Fairness pleases the Arabs.  I wish this were true.  Let's see.  Fairness.  Does that mean letting everyone, including Jews and Arabs, buy land throughout the region and keep it?  Does that mean a Truth and Reconciliation session or two where the Arabs can apologize for their violence and aggression against Levantine Jews?  Sounds fair to me!  Shlaim is totally out of line to pretend that it is unfair to not steal Jewish land, or that it is unfair to allow Israel to stay on the map.  As for the Oslo peace accords, Shlaim praises them as the beginning of a new era.  Plenty of people were extremely suspicious of Oslo.  Shlaim was wrong here.  And those who were suspicious of Oslo generally had the right reasons to be suspicious.  I think that ought to make us more than a little suspicious of Shlaim.  Now, what does Shlaim recommend?  It is simple.  America is simply too much in favor of Israel!  Shlaim thinks we need a more "even-handed" approach.  And that (this was written before 9/11) America ought not "bolster Israel as a strategic partner in an unwinnable war against an imaginary Islamic threat."  Wow.  Imaginary.  But unbeatable.  Shlaim really took a strong view here.  I think 9/11 showed that we're dealing with a real, not an imaginary threat.  And in the long run, why shouldn't a war in favor of truth, justice, and human rights be winnable?  I see no reason to give up without even trying.  If you want to learn about war and peace in the Middle East, try some other book 
 Mark Rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in America.  Most of his ideas are solid, but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word "interesting" to describe it.  Did they actually read it?  This book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different, yet equally boring ways.  I honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever.  This book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original, not to mention solid, ideas.  The nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument.    Not only was the book dry, but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the US is a part of, and in particular, the role that immigration plays on poverty in the US.  He talks about the US and the people in it as if they were static, but we live in a very fluid world, growing more fluid everyday, and I feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument.  
 Usually I like fantasy, comic fantasy, parodies of all sorts etc... but I simply was not able to move beyond first ten pages -and believe me, I tried! After all those good reviews...  being not able to read even half a book - this almost does not happen to me (usually I feel obliged to author to read more, before passing judgement). BORING 
 This book is full of code samples - unfortunately, none of them actually work, because they're all missing a lot of detail.  For example, in chapter 8, on Spring JDBC, all of the examples use a database schema... whose details aren't presented.  If you're already very familiar with JDBC, you can figure this out from the code samples; but if you're not an expert on a given topic (for example, AOP), you won't be able to make heads or tails of the examples; you won't even understand what they're trying to do (the book doesn't bother to try to clarify).  All in all, I found this book extremely frustrating - it seems as if the authors understand the how, but not the why.  If they do understand the why, they certainly do a good job of hiding it.  Take it from me - skip this one 
 Just Awful It seems I only write reviews when they are negative, but I think this is because I feel so cheated when a book is so horrible that I actually feel angry for having invested my time and money in it. I feel I want to warn fellow readers so they don't make the same mistake I made. This just may be the most long-winded, boring, disappointing book I have read in a long time. The characters were not believable.  However, they are gutless and heartless. Imagine abandoning your own daughter because she is the victim of rape, or any crime for that matter.  Imagine the daughter accepting this as though she deserves to be treated in such a fashion by her own family. The storyline went nowhere, and the author prattled on and on without ever getting to the point. I stubbornly kept reading in the hope that at some point it would finally draw me in, but NO SUCH LUCK! In addition, the ending left much to be desired. What a disappointment 
 Good basic overview - kinda bland.  Too expensive for the material within 
 I have all but 2 books of this series (but not necessarily in chronological order), and at this point, I'm coming to the realization that after awhile, an author has said all there is to be said with a certain character/scenario.  How many times can Eve Dallas be personally targeted? How many victims remind her of her own troubled past? How many times can Roarke save the day? How many times can they have passionant sex that's a metaphor for how much she cares for him but is unable to express in words? After awhile, it seems like everything in Eve Dallas' life is a drama of Soap Opera proportions!   Like most hard-boiled type detectives, the action and adventure is non-stop and you never get the feeling that Eve gets to rest. After awhile, I find myself exhausted FOR the heroine and eventually I lose sympathy and interest. After all, who can identify with someone who is always strong enough to deal with anything that's pitched to her?   When the plot is intriguing, I don't mind the constant drama so much. I've enjoyed many of the other books, particularly Portrait in Death and Rapture in Death. But by this point, the clichs are getting really old, and I wonder if it isn't time for Ms. Robb to start a new series 
 While I give the book kudos, I'd veer away from the school itself. I went to the school after calling them saying I'd love to work there only to find out they weren't hiring (lied on the phone) and to work there I needed to take *all* the classes. They had me on one couch and three other women telling me to give them money. Trying to like push me into whipping out my check book and take classes.  I think it's nice to help women see the light, but not push them into paying an arm and a leg.  Seriously, they ask for five thousand dollars to take their classes. Buy the book, get some healthy friends that are open about love and learning and do it for free 
 In the tsk, tsk being thrown on Pope Pius XII by this author, I'm amazed that he never discusses the complete absence of any condemnation of Communism by the bishops at Vatican II.    Given that the initial Vatican II documents contained such a condemnation of Communism and given the widespread persecution and mass murder of Christians by communist regimes in Eastern Europe and China (in much larger numbers than any of Hitler's mass murders) during this time period, the ultimate decision to omit any reference to Communism from the Vatican II documents dwarfs any lapse of duty Pope Pius XII might have committed.  The failure of any of Pope Pius XII's critics to address this second betrayal at Vatican II should give objective readers pause to consider just where these critics sympathies lie 
 I picked up this book because I was interested in future life progressions.  As one fairly conversant with the doctrines of reincarnation and recognizing this book was written over 20 years ago, my concerns are as fresh as they would have been when the book was first available:  (1) a total lack of objectivity. Dr. Goldberg has his own spiritual beliefs about reincarnation and things surrounding reincarnation, and he teaches and preaches from that viewpoint. Unfortunately, he fails to make it clear that he is teaching his personal dogma. (2)He is quick to condemn.  I was particularly struck by his blanket condemnation of all witchcraft, all covens, and by extension, all magical practices.  This bespeaks ignorance of the subject and comes from a fairly narrow view, much as if I were to give a blanket condemnation of Christianity.  Personally, I believe Christianity to be far more dangerous, but I recognize that this is opinion, and don't preach it as fact.  (3) Overall, I found his research and techniques very disorganized.  To me, this is rather sad for an accomplished hypnotist, because it diminishes his effectiveness.  Both in his writing and reporting, and in his interviews, I felt he  could greatly improve both interview and writing style by having a better idea of where he is going and the cues given by subjects.      Personally, Dr. Goldberg is not a practitioner I would select to help me with regression or progression, based on my experience with this book. There are other authors dealing with the subject.  I would direct the interested reader to a more solid author, such as Brian Weiss. 
 Now I must confess that I am a historical fiction fan and NOT a romance fan.  I came across the first book in this series and enjoyed it.  I was a bit put off by the constant pride, by one misunderstanding after another leading to constant bickering, etc., but the story was fun and adventurous.  I decided to read the second book and was dismayed to find practically the SAME thing repeated all over again.  A strong-willed female defying her male captor, they fight verbally and physically, they accuse each of other lying... they have sex and fall in love.  Come on!  Did the second book have to be a cookie cutter of the first one?  I can understand the need for tension to keep the pages turning, but this book was overkill in that regard.  If the writing was not about the two principal characters fighting, then it was endless commentary on patriotic and political musings of the characters.  I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if it had varied a bit more from the first book.  It think I am done with this series.  If you are looking for a story that is full of tension -- physical, psychological, emotional and sexual, but does not have much substance, then you'll love this book.  If you want something a bit more intelligent, find another book 
 I've read some of his pieces online and part of his book and I doubt he's thinking up these opinions by himself. He's just regurgitating what he's heard on the radio 
 Short version: A half dozen scientists and engineers are working in the arctic, attempting to use explosives to create a huge iceberg that can floated to someplace in dire need of fresh water. They become marooned and only have a few hours before the explosives they've planted go off and kill them. However, a Russian sub may be able to save them.  Koontz had the right idea when he originally released this book under a pseudonym, because it's a stinker.  The set-up building to the scientists being stranded and the deadline imposed by the explosives is unbelievable. Suffice it to say that a natural disaster hundreds of miles away just happens to target the exact location of where the scientists are working. Additionally, they've planted explosives in the ice that are on timers and can't be switched off.  Besides suffering from incompetence, the characters have unbelievably bad luck (beyond being targeted for destruction by Mother Nature, that is):   -One is highly phobic, terrified of (you guessed it): ice & snow (because of an accident that killed her parents)! -Another's family was murdered in China -Another's had close relatives assasinated while in office and is disillusioned by politics (a thinly disguised JFK jr?) -Another lost his son to cancer -Another's psychotic  If that's not bad enough, the main characters are a husband and wife team who run the project. She had a relationship with another scientist that ended badly before getting married to the current guy. So who does her husband pick to spend months on ice with? Why the ex-boyfriend of course! Because he was the best at what he did (excuse me, wouldn't second best have made more sense?)  If you don't mind really bad dialog and trite situations, give this book a try. If you want a really intense adventure/thriller try Wilbur Smith's "Hungry as the Sea" or anything by Nelson DeMille 
 With this book, I was expecting Zinn to go into more detail about America in the 20th century, but it is essentially the 20th century chapters of People's History of the United States taken out and labeled as a new and different book. If you have an older version of Pepole History of the United States by Howard Zinn, the Twentieth Century might be good because of the chapters relating to the elder Bush and Clinton administrations. The rest of the chapters are in people's history. However, recent version the people history of the united states do contain the extra chapters so if it would be better  to just get a later version of People's History of the United States instead if you don't have a copy yet 
 I can't help but wonder if this film wasn't made more from an excuse to cash in on the popularity of John Goodman at the time of this film than an honest desire to portray the baseball icon.  It would certainly explain the film's inaccuracies and rushed feel.  I remember that around that time (late 80's, early 90s), Goodman seemed to be fairly popular.  Can it be coincidence that somebody wanted to make a film about Babe Ruth at around the same time Goodman started receiving recognition in Hollywood?  Honestly, I don't think so.  At any rate, Goodman is miscast as Ruth.  For one thing, Ruth wasn't really fat; more like broad and stocky.  He was quite athletic and able to play the field -  remember, there was no such thing as a designated hitter back then.  In other words, offense isn't the only part of baseball; Ruth played defense too.  Does this film ever show Ruth in the outfield?  Can't say for sure because I didn't really watch the entire thing, but it's hard to imagine paunchy John Goodman fielding fly balls.  The other thing is Goodman is simply unlikeable as Ruth.  As we can see from film footage (including Pride of the Yankees), the real Ruth was energetic and charismatic.  Goodman's Ruth is simply loud, crass and grating 
 It's not too difficult to understand how "Behold a Pale Horse" has become "the best selling underground book of all time"(according to a blurb on one pro-Cooper website)--after all, people want to(and do) believe in outlandish things. The problem with the late Bill Cooper's book is that it damages any serious attempt to examine the reasonable premise that every aspect of world affairs is controlled by a handful of wealthy, powerful men. Cooper believed this, Cooper was a nut...therefore it follows that everyone who agrees with the basic hypothesis is a nut, too. Rightly or wrongly, this is what people believe. (If you're looking for a serious treatment of this subject, albeit from the POV of someone who thought it was a good thing, take a gander at Carroll Quigley's monumental "Tragedy and Hope".) To all the "if you can't handle the truth, don't read this book!" reviewers who know little to nothing about Bill Cooper: I invite you to do a Google search on the man and acquaint yourselves with another truth, the real truth. Milton William Cooper was a certifiable headcase. Numerous former friends and acquaintances have described him as a hard-drinking, ill-tempered, violent man who was incredibly easy to fool. Cooper's contention that John F. Kennedy was killed by William Greer, the driver of his limo in Dallas, is of course well-known...but he also believed, and told audiences at his lectures, that the aliens on the Fox television show "Alien Nation" were real aliens. He wasn't kidding. Cooper would hear or read an outlandish tidbit of information, then take it--and repeat it!--as gospel. Fellow "fringe" writers and researchers like Bob Lazar shunned Cooper after he accused them of being government agents who were out to discredit him. There was, of course, no need for anyone else to discredit him: he took care of that himself. Nowhere in this rambling patchwork quilt of a book(mostly documents and articles from other sources, really, with a comment here and there by Cooper himself) is there a shred of proof to back up his extraordinary claims. Cooper made no attempt to verify the info he included, and it would have been impossible to do so in almost every instance, anyhow.   I'll go on record as saying that I believe the circumstances of Cooper's death were suspicious. I feel badly for the man because he came to such an ignoble end, and because his affection for his wife and daughter is so evident in the foreword to "Pale Horse". This was a human being with real feelings...but he was very, very disturbed. There are countless other books which examine this subject more rationally; so many that "Behold a Pale Horse" should NEVER become any conspiracy theorist's bible.     
 Only worked for a couple days.  Wouldn't spend my money on it again 
 I am disappointed with this book.  I was really looking forward to reading it since I own Baby Bargains and recommend it to anyone I know.  This is a huge disappointment compared to Baby Bargains.  Most of the reviews are pretty general, and as one reviewer stated, the information can be found on-line.  I thought it would cover a lot more product than it does.  I purchased the book looking for information on 2 separate items (umbrella/travel strollers and bike trailers) and was unsatisfied with the information.  Umbrella strollers aren't even mentioned, and bike trailers consist of one page with only one review.  Not at all what I had expected.  Had I flipped thru the pages before buying I could have saved myself a few dollars 
 I started reading this book, skipping the introduction and then realized this isn't the Tao Te Ching at all. This is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said, and so he wrote his own version. It turns out the author admits this in the introduction. I wish I had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk. I guess I should have taken the hint with the "A New Version" doublespeak on the front cover. Sigh. I usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs.      
 I've been using this remote since it was released.  Better than any others I've run into, but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too, be prepared to give up a couple of hours.  When it's working, it's a 5 Star device, however...read on as to why I give it a 2.  As I type this, my hold time is up to 45 minutes on the phone to 2nd level support.  3rd call today.  I simply got a new PVR.  Programmed OK, but it isn't the default device when I watch TV.  Also, it took two calls to find out my DirecTV PVR is not a PVR, it's a "satellite".  As a "PVR", it couldn't be added to Activities because "you don't have a device that will change channels".  News to me.  Never known a PVR that couldn't change channels.  Literally, 4 friggin' hours so far and it still not right.  At some point, the TV suddenly stopped turning on.  2-3 hours on that issue and it's still not right.  TV does not go on until I hit the "Help" button on the remote.  To add insult to injury, I can't access the website.  Enter my email as an ID and am told it's already in the database.  I ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized.  I hate that the software doesn't have a simple "Home" button.  You have to go through several menus to get back to it.   Hold time now up to 52 minutes.  I have to hang up for an appt., so the hold has to be repeated....AGAIN.   Oh yeah...I also dislike the size of the buttons, especially the numbers. Cell phone sized. No doubt designed for a dainty child.   I could go on, but if another comes out with a product like this one, I'll be looking hard at it 
 the fact that Woodward was a briefer to Alexander Haig when Woodward was serving in the Navy. Tons of documents have come out disproving the allegations of Bernstein and Woodward in All the President's Men and Final Days. The authors downplay the relationship between Haig and Woodward dramatically, hiding the fact that Haig was Deep Throat. Look at this logically: why would a high up guy in the executive branch named "Deep Throat" come out of nowhere to reveal what he knew about Watergate? Deep Throat MUST have had a previous relationship with Woodward, and the only man with a connection to Woodward who knew so much about Watergate was Alexander Haig. Why isn't this mentioned in ANY of the Woodward/Bernstein books 
   This is the worst book I've ever read by Danielle Steel. I kept looking at the author's name to be sure it was hers.  So boring, so repetitive, I got so frustrated with reading the same information over & over just arranged differently.  She has some wonderful books out but pass on this one. 
 My blood was boiling as I read other customers' rave reviews of "The Prince of Tides."  Whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature.  Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat Conroy to Virginia Woolf.  What a joke!  Woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real.  She cuts to the quick, whereas Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions.  One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story.  I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths.  In the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book.  They do not speak in reams of figurative language.  I cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children.  Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them.  (I make that claim as a Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.)  It's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.  Read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal (John Irving, etc.), but avoid it if you have any respect for the English language and for real American literature (Cheever, Plath, Hemingway, Cather, etc.).  Don't be fooled by all the fools out there.  
 I have read the other reviews of this book. All got to say is that I feel that most of them must have read a different book! I not completely new to Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise but I am no expert so I thought the book would  be very suitable for me how wrong can you be. I give you an example Samba very popular application. Can be difficult to setup with the in-built Fedora Firewall. The book chapter is useless in giving you a real tutorial on how to really get the program working it gives you a little bit of information than completel lets you down. This is only an example chapter after chapter are like this. My recommadation if you learning Linux buy an other Red Hat book 
 Ever since I loaded the Targus drivers on my Tungsten C, the battery discharges quickly and won't take a full charge.  I've removed the driver, with no change.  The next step was to do a hard reset of the Tungsten C and I'm hoping it will take charge.  I'm taking this keyboard back for a full refund 
 Does anyone even care that the "Author" John Miller, formerly of ABC's 20/20 and then the head of counterterrorism for the LAPD, is currently the Assistant Director of Public Affairs for the FBI in the BUSH regime...I mean...Administration.  This book is Propaganda. Period 
 Sorry - I swear I'm not a snob - but I tossed my copy rather than pass it on like I do with most books.  I got through it but in my opinion it was rather predictable and childish.  I would have been more pleased if I found out the writer was in high school.  Try something by Jim Grimsley or Bart Yates if you are looking for a good story and higher quality writing 
 At 459 mind numbing pages I would suggest saving yourself about 15 hours of reading time and pick up "Stress free for good" by Luskin and Pelletier, both books have the same goal to reduce your perpetual stress mode, both authors have the same basic credentials however this book (Undoing perpetual stress) goes on and on about the author, his last book, his theories about stress, and all his opinions. "Stress free for good" gives you quick principle to use now. Buy this book if you find stress incredible fascinating and would like to study it for 15 hours. The book is sound scientifically and has a lot of great points, but who has time to read a big scientific book when you are looking for relief from stress now? This book stressed me out 
 I can't help but agree with most of the reviews on this page; this guide is nearly useless. The Prima (the leader in half-assing every guide they've ever gotten their hands on) guide "walks" us through a game where chest locations are off and inaccurate, enemies don't   appear in the right spots, the data on the Fiend Challenges is basically: "kill the guys that um... you know, attack... uh yeah." There's misspellings in a few cases and grammatical errors. Also keep in mind: their boss strategies aren't crucial to your survival, I bearly used 'em. The only slightly useful piece of this guide is the Golden Scarabs. One note on that, once you find the 50th GO BACK AND TURN THEM IN. I made the mistake of not trudging back to town due to being anxious about beating the game. In summery: don't buy this unless you really need feel you need a very small amount of visual support. You're better off on your own 
 This movie had barely any cool 3-D sequences, was boring, and babyish. Juni gets zapped into a video game. The acting is pretty bad, and there is pretty much no story. It's just flying around on machines. Is that entertainment or what(sarcasm) ? You could enjoy it if you were a 3 year old, but, since you are on this site, you probably aren't three, so I would not reccomend this movie to you 
 The plot and pacing of this movie are terrible... Patton is great in one role, horrible in another... it is indeed painful to watch all of it.  The movie cannot be compared to Lynch.  Karen black is good in her roles.  And I agree, the visuals are interesting, it is already a cult classic. 
 Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length.  (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. Ick. Self-induldgent.  Boring.)  Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject's wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations.  I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming.  Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars.    John McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story 
 My 8-year old picked this up yesterday, she was very excited.  In summary, after about 15 minutes, she was in tears over the thing.  Reason being is that she was frustrated with the overall navigation and controls for configuring and setting up the thing.  We located the instructions buried in the packaging, and were able to eventually get past it.    After configuring, she had the instructions out trying to send messages - she finally was able to do it, but it's not very easy.  In addition, the IR is a severe limitation as line of sight must be maintained.    This product would be much better if it was RF-based, and was less cryptic in the initial setup, as well as sending a message.  For example to send a message, here's process:  - Chat Mode button - type message - send button - it then asks for the P/I? which we have no clue what that is - then hit ICQ button   Several steps, lots of button pushing, not the most intuitive.  Recommend that you do not buy this 
 I am 38 and considered obese, however I work in a busy operating room all day and found this to be too easy. This DVD would be great for the older generations. I still need to loose 45 pounds and I am using Denise Austin's Burn Fat Fast. 
 I started this book about 6 months ago and never finished but I started reading it on a recent vacation and unfortunately had nothing else to read so I finished it. Lila, the supposed-heroine of the book is the most annoying and selfish character I have read lately. The rest of the characters were no better and seemed so stereo-typical and boring. I think the whole story was completely illogical, especially how she had never been in love yet but when she gets married she turns into a co-dependent and pathetic excuse for a woman who then is supposed to be this nationally acclaimed poet who seems like nothing but a shallow 30-sometihng who sleeps around. Plus the characterization of her family is completely ridiculous; I know of no one whose own family is that insensitive. The whole story was so trite and so predictable. I wish I would have read all of the reviews before I bought this book 
 This book makes a lot of assumptions.  It assumes that the reader is EXTREMELY well versed in corporate tax advantages.  It assumes that the reader already owns a corporation.  It assumes that the book will be read with a dictionary of financial terms close at hand.  (It should be.  The book is poorly written, with key terms lacking adequate defenition.)  I support the Rich Dad series.  It is a great way for a beginner to get their feet wet.  This book assumes that the reader can already swim!  Even the seasoned incorporator would probably not be pleased with this book.  Tell you what, if you are considering buying this book, save yourself some money and just send me ten bucks.  I'll then call you (on my own dime) and summarize the book for you.  Oh, what the heck, I'll do it now, for free...surround yourself with a competent team of advisors 
 As a lecturer of e-commerce, I was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the Internet.  However, I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored.  The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about.  The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic.  I have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted 
 Nicely drawn characters; good writing; different and compelling story. Why don't I like it, then? Because of what the author did with these things. It ends in disaster and proves nothing. Afterwards, I find that this novel lingers in the mind like a bad taste in the mouth. I wish to God I'd never read it 
 I was lent the entire Radiohead discography. I hardly kept about 10 songs which are indeed quite good : "Sail to the moon", "Nice dream", "Creep"... but the rest is a proper disaster. I was appalled by the live stuff : the guy just cannot sing properly unless he is backed by studio effects. He just has no voice, just a dismal creaking off-key whine that just make ears cringe. But apparently not everyone has ears. No to mention very poor melodies for most songs.  The fact this band is so popular is not very encouraging. Creaking off-key whine lovers. 
 This book covers little ground. The author extends comic relief constantly, which gets extremely annoying. Many books on this subject are much better 
 Riordan has created an interesting and original character in Tres Navarre, and I will trust other reviewers' claims that the local color--an important part of any private eye series--is right on the money; however, I find it difficult to believe that this book and its predecessor, Big Red Tequila, won awards for anything.   The plots, as other reviewers have noted, are suspect at best, fouled by loose ends that never really get resolved.  Many of the secondary characters blur together.  Often Tres's motivation is difficult to fathom.  And the dialogue is the weakest part of the series (if Ralph, Tres's Hispanic sidekick, said "vato" one more time, I was prepared to douse my paperback copy in gasoline and set it afire).  Did this novel really enjoy the attention of a professional editor? I've read much better--how are these "awards" determined, anyway 
 This book was not entertaining.  I suffered through each page.  I hated the plot and most of the characters.  I will never read another Doss book again 
 I hated this book.  It says quite strongly that if you're not meeing ALL your spouse's needs ALL the time, they may "fall victim" to an affair.  It is a kind of emotional blackmail.  None of us is perfect at meeting our spouse's needs.  While I encourage communication about these needs, it is awful to use any shortcomings (which we all have) to justify a spouse's straying 
 Pros: the book does contain some useful information.  Cons: authors are dishonest. They intentionally hide some of the side effects of the drugs. Examples: fipexide has been linked to liver damage - the book says nothing, piracetam does have withdrawal symptoms - the book says the opposite, caffeine improves short term memory - the books says that there were "studies" that showed the opposite. I see the message: buy our "safe" drugs and stop drinking "very dangerous" coffee.  BEFORE YOU BUY ANYTHING IN THIS BOOK, THOROUGHLY RESEARCH THE DRUG ON YOUR OWN.  No wonder Ward Dean is now spending 7 year jail term for taxes evasion 
 Here's a line from the song Vato on this album: "I wouldn't be the n_____ that I am if I didn't pop n____z in the mouth."  Isn't that poetic? Snoop Dogg manages to pull off an amazing feat. He makes sex, drugs and violence seem so ... boring. I feel like I am supposed to be offended. But it's too boring to be offensive. We have songs about every kind of gang violence, every kind of drug, and every kind of cheap sex. And what are we left with?  He gets two stars because his approach to the city of Los Angeles is fresh and loving. Hip Hop should be local, and he does a good job with that. Otherwise it'd be a one-star 
 This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.  It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.    I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery?  That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.  I can't believe that I was asking too much.  Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of "Welcome to Maine!"   
 This menure is almost as bad revisionism as the irish fairy tale book! He as usual does not sight his sources, and appears to make it up as he goes. Miss MacDonald's review said it very well. If you believe in anything Cahill spews, you may as well believe the "Sun rises in the west." I won't waste another nano-second on anything this hack writes 
 Maybe I made a mistake starting with a book that's 3rd in a series without reading the earlier ones first. I gave it up at page 118 as I just couldn't get engaged by the characters.  My previous experience with the Anita Blake series led me to this book hoping for a gutsy heroine and lots of action. There is action and descriptions of odd characters with extra eyes and magic skills. Guess I didn't make it to the sexy parts, as they mostly were talking about it, trying to be lyrical, but somehow the characters weren't coming alive for me so I gave it up.  I didn't want to pan this book entirely, knowing Laurell Hamilton's abilities, she might pull it together, but I just wasn't willing to keep soldiering on hoping for a turn around. 
 "Customers who bought this item also bought ...". That's the bit that is easily overlooked when one orders that item. Once the toy arrives you will be surprised to know that a number of accessories are also needed. It takes a lot of time to finding some, and a lot more creative thinking for others (gravel!). And then this compound starts getting highly educational as you have to teach the child to handle his/her birthday present the way a nurse would normally deal with patients under intensive care. The whole thing is a little disappointing overall. An actual comment about this item was nothing les than "this package sure is nice". Maybe the idea is interesting, but will offer more headaches than fun to your family 
 Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.   My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here 
 The book starts out fairly good, but then once they go off into the gamma quadrant and meet the Jem'Hadar warship, it sucks. The Jem'Hadar act nothing like they do in the show, and neither do the changelings. The  changelings talk about the weather and other cultures, and they take Odo to  an outpost where changelings are just walking around.    And worse, the  Jem'Hadar are hunting down something on their ship for sport, wearing  something you'd see in Hawaii. Don't buy this book!!!!! I set it on fire  after reading it 
 only 5 songs worth anything the rest is all noise.  2 of them are well knowns played millions of times, Walk Away, funk #49  The REAL burners on is this are, Laguna Salada, Country Fever, and the best song of all is "You're going to need me, Live"  oh man!  if your only going to buy one song, this is it!!    
 Everybody who wrote in 5-Star reviews is probably seeing my 1-Star review (and I'm being generous with 1 star, at that), and they're thinking, "Oh, this review is by another one of those shallow individuals who was just looking for a trashy, self-serving, ghost-written Hollywood-type autobiography, someone who doesn't appreciate all the deep spiritual insight that this book provides."    To them I say, GET OVER IT! I found this book a major disappointment mostly because I'm gay, and I wanted the book to tell me more of what life was like for a closeted Hollywood gay actor who was in his prime during years in which being gay was considered an illness and/or a crime. Needless to say, Richard Chamberlain didn't give me what I wanted, which proves to me that he's STILL in the closet, in the sense that he probably says "I'm so much more than just a gay actor: Look everybody, I'm this deeply spiritual person (Move over, Shirley MacClain), and besides, that part of my life is private and nobody's business." I have news for you, Richard: when you write your autobiography, you're letting readers in on what your "business" is. Read Billy Bean. Read Christopher Isherwood. Read Ned Rorem, for God's sake! And let's not kid ourselves here, many of the gay readers of this book found out about it because of all the free publicity it received in the gay press. With all that, Mr. Chamberlain has the gall to stingingly refer to the people who were about to "out" him as "gay activist cowboys", all the time spouting his new-age "I love everybody because we're all LOVE and GOD" drivel. If it weren't for these "activist cowboys"--many who have given their lives to the cause of equal rights for gays--he wouldn't be able to live his life the way he does today. I find it almost disgusting that he spends more time in this book talking about his loss of heterosexual virginity, than he does about his relationship with Martin (whose last name is never mentioned, by the way.) Does anybody think that Goldie Hawn would refer to her first husband, Gus Trikonis, as simply "Gus", or Carol Burnett would call the father of her children "Joe", instead of Joe Hamilton? Of course not! Even Liz Taylor remembers the last names of her spouses. But "Martin" reamains just "Martin". Chamberlain may as well have put an asterisk and the disclaimer (Not his real name) after each minimal mention of Martin, for all the attention he lavishes on his life-partner.     Richard, if you were worried about offending all those old ladies who worshipped Dr. Kildare, and that's why you mentioned your gayness so briefly--and no, doing drag to play Drew Carey's mother doesn't count as part of being gay--I'll try to break this news to you as gently as I can: They're all dead, Richard! They're all dead! There's nobody left to offend now.     Looks like I'll have to wait for Tab Hunter to write his autobiography 
 Readers will save themselves much unrewarding labor by disregarding both "Precision and soul" and, I daresay, the highly-touted "Man Without Qualities," reading instead his first work "Young  Torless" and the stories collected under "Five Women."   Musil's derivative philosophical and psychological preoccupations invite  inevitable comparisons with Nietzsche and Freud, both of whose work is  vastly more durable and fruitful.  Despite the powerfully bracing, if not  occasionally repellent, astringency of his style, Musil's work subsequent  to "Five Women" falls considerably short of the enormous and  difficult ambitions which preoccupied his maturity; and, what's more, such  a gaping failure of world-historical pretension tends to pollute enjoyments  one might otherwise have had in reading it.  Read something by one whose  enormous abilities are truly equal to ungodly ambitions -- read Proust 
 I tried to keep an open-minded perspective on the arguments made in this book but they're just outrageous.  Despite the military flexing along the Taiwan Straits in 1996 (from where most of the arguments and extrapolations  in this book are drawn) and the recent verbal jousts during the  Presidential elections where the upsart and pro-independence DPP forged  ahead, China remains to be a superpower to be reckoned and does what any  other superpower would do to edge favorably.  What the writers here have  amassed is far-fetched scenarios and conclusions that makes it a good  science fiction if it weren't terrestial based 
 As the 1st Lieutenant who led Mr. Garcia's supposed platoon,  1967-68, I would like to point out that none of the incidents he describes, coincide with the experience of any other members of the platoon, or after-action reports of operations.  In fact, no one, including myself, can remember having served on the line with him, and we were a close-knit group.  It is a work of fiction, not the facts, and should be seen as such. For those unsung heroes of the 3rd platoon of B company, who really did bear the burden of some of the bloodiest battles of that war, it is shameful that this man is attempting to profit from his fictitous heroism.  As has been documented in  Stolen Valor, all men who served, wished to be seen as heroic and brave, and many who were not, later, falsely claimed to have to have been Audie Murphy.  I think this phoney hero owes the "real" members of the 3rd platoon, an apology and should pull his book from the shelves.  Hopefully Amazon will do it for him for perpetuating his false "non-fiction"  DAVID BELDING, CAPTAIN,US ARMY RETIRED 
 When I saw that the movie was from the creators of Legally Blonde, I figured it would be original and hilarious, boy was I wrong. It is so ridiculously predictable, I mean they should have put a twist somewhere in the plot. The plot wasnt even that great. When Topher Grace was trying to show is affection for Kate Bosworth he was being too mean and way too obvious. I mean Kate Bosworth's character had to be stupid not to see that Topher was in love with her. Plus Bosworth's character was quiet annoying. Her hair was bothering me the whole movie, and that whole retainer thing at dinner was such a weird part. I agree with another review who said "what 22 year old would wear a retainer let alone take it out on a date with a moviestar" let alone on a date with a human, it was gross. I would not recommend this movie     , entirely too predictable and too lame to enjoy. 
 This book does not present any new information. Several books, notably Duncan's "The Dollar Crisis" does a much better job of explaining the fundamental dangers of a managed currency. This book adds smugness and some barely comprehensible jibes at the current American system for not being libertarian enough, but throughout the book there is barely a suggestion of a practical solution for any of the problems it describes. Duncan provides some pie in the sky solutions, (a global minimum wage), but at least he says something.  Wiggins' final advice is to buy gold. Hope I didn't spoil it for ya. The reason why you should amounts to, "because it was good enough for ancient Rome". There is VERY much repetition of the basic points, and many of the anecdotes don't support the point he makes in the same chapter. The entire chapter on John Law could have been explained in a sentence, and then he could have taken some time to tell us what we could do to avoid the temptation to inflate the currency! This is supposed to be a book about the coming of the reckoning day, but other than a timid assertion that the current bear market could last as long as 18 years, we don't even get a hint of what factors would have to combine to create the catastrophic financial conditions that the book's title seems to presuppose.  All in all worthless. Read Duncan 
 This book did not live up to its hype. It tries to do for Guenevere what Mists of Avalon did for Morgan le Fey, but it fails sorely because the title character is an embittered shrew. The plot repeats itself endlessly over the course of three novels. Guenevere loves Arthur, she hates Arthur, she forgives Arthur, she loves Arthur again, no wait, she hates him.... Arthur, by the way, is a weak, feeble-minded, doddering simpleton. This is not the great king of Arthurian legend at all. Lancelot is still a tasty dish, but there is no apparent reason why he would love a bitter, jealous, middle-aged woman who repeatedly casts him away. Morgan le Fey starts out as a promising character, but becomes a demonic harpy-type creature. And the tone is excessively anti-Christian. I'm not a religious person at all, but even I was offended by the way Christians are depicted in this novel. It's just not a pleasant read. If you want a great trilogy told from Guenevere's point of view, read Persia Woolley's Guenevere trilogy or Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. They're well worth the time and effort 
 Methods are outdated and rely more or less on the momentum stock craze of the late 90's.(example: csco was 70 a share when they wrote the book and is used in most or their examples.) I highly doubt they are still trading. Daytrading is a tough business so look to get reliable infomation. Dont start with this book. Sorry to be so critical but its just bad information to sell to the public 
 Allan Bloom, the late translator of Plato's Republic and professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago, has assembled a partially cranky, but never the less insightful critical examination of the American University system in the post-60's era. His assessment predictably reeks of the stuffy conservatism of his mentor Leo Strauss, but that should not deter one from confronting his arguments. The American university, in his perception, is inundated with transitory cultural and political problems; the academy (in Plato's conception), must continually strive towards the good, it must teach what is eternal and beautiful and drop the multi-culturalism and relativism of the postmodern era. Bloom is distraught about the preponderance of German philosophy in the academy, a Nietzschean rejection of morality and a Heideggerian rejection of the impact of the individual. Bloom's knowledge of history and philosophy is fair, and his arguments are not totally grounded in neo-conservatism (he rejects the legitimacy of the MBA), yet at the same time his book often comes across as an old man's rant. He does not value the creativity and individuality of the student intellect, and he may ultimately just be afraid of the black panthers. On the contrary, I suspect that his concerns may be more relevant today as the popularity of the liberal arts degree has lessened, and superficial non-fields such as feminism and multi-culturalism appear to have grounded their place in the academy for good. 
 i'm sorry but this is one of the weakest biographies i have ever read (and yes, i have read more than one). the writing is very poor, it reminds me of a grade 8 essay where you can easily see the way the facts have been jotted down in point form and then strung together to form sentences and paragraphs. i feel like half the time the author was simplky reciting a stat or tidbit jotted down on a cocktail napkin.  hendrix never comes alive in this book, you never get a feel for who the man was or where his genius came from and took him. it all feels very quick and breezy, little commentary or insight and more just a retelling of facts long since comitted to the annals of rock legend.  i daresay that the author would have done well to read the few cover stories on jimi put out over the years by britain's mojo magazine. these manage, in their few short pages, to tell the same story in a far deeper and more meaningful way.  when one compares this with - for example - neil young's biography 'shakey' by jimmy mcdonough, one can immediately see the difference between a well written biog and a poorly written one. icons are always a tough creature to dissect, there are layers and layers of worship and legend to get through to get to the real facts and paint a glimpse of the real person. but this also involves good writing; a biographer cannot simply write as a journalist, reciting facts and taking a time-out from any sort of personal insight or commentary. ultimately a good biographer seeks to explore the individual, to journey through their life and vividly assemble and comment on the facts, events, rumours, heresay, and legends that create that persona.  that is rarely done in this biog. this is a safe, conservative, backseat look at an artist who was rarely anything other than a complex genius who truly needs to be looked at with a critical as well as factual eye to fully understand.  not so the case here. skiiiiiiiiip it.   
 I read all of the reviews and the author's description. I had been contacted via email, as I am an astrophysics PhD candidate, by the author to look at it. I do not frequently discount a book by its cover. But, for this, I will make an exception. The book is discounting a theory (a set of facts, propositions, or principles analyzed in their relation to one another and used, especially in science, to explain phenomena) that has had supporting observations since the mid-1950's. (example WMAP) Do not give this author a bigger head by buying his non-credible book. A 450 page credible book to dismantle a long standing theory would have lots more than 5 technical illustrations. Save the trees and buy a good book 
 This book should be entitled "The Obsessive-compulsive's Guide to Keeping House".  The lists of tasks to do daily, weekly and monthly were more than a little overwhelming. If you did all the things this book says you need to do to keep a clean, orderly home then you will have little time for anything else.  There are some good ideas in here, but they are overshadowed by the to-do checklists.  Also the pictures in this book are of rooms with a very sterile, minimalist look to them.  Boring.  The rooms are indeed clutter free and spotlessly clean, but lack character and warmth.  A little like living in a hospital. I was very disappointed with this book 
 I read this excruciating book and checked with an expert psychologist.  I was told that the author is a well-known and well-respected researcher and that her data on generational trends is solid.  the conclusions she draws from her data are accurate.  she is identifying real concerns.  the problem is her attitude.  when she goes beyond her data she is lost, in my opinion.  her judgemental attitude causes her to use anecdotal evidence in a selective manner and to overgeneralize well past her data.  I have a degree in physics and I am not impressed with this use of anecdotal evidence, nor her generalizations about large groups people she does not know in a way that goes beyond her data.  there have been several books characterizing young people.  Generation Debt and Stiffed are two of them.  Stiffed is the only one in my opinion that tries for a helpful tone.  I see Generation Debt and Generation Me as opposite sides of the same coin.  I dislike both authors' attitudes equally.  Each provides highly negative views of a generation to which they do not really belong.  Although this author claims to be a part of Generation Me, it is just barely according to her stated definition and she states over and over that she is a contrarian who denies the value of Generation Me's behavior and ideals.  In contrast, the author of Generation Debt defines her generation as helpless victims of greedy older Americans, a view I find outrageous given what Baby Boomers and "the greatest generation" have contributed to society.  What causes this author to fail is her judgemental tone and attitude.  People who judge large numbers of strangers in an aggrieved way, or a postive way, miss critical information. Their strong emotions tend to block them from seeing what is.  Instead they see what should be and this acts as a filter to block information that contradicts the assessment.  This can lead to "confirmation bias" in which anything that supports the author's attitude, including vague anecdotes and sweeping generalizations, is OK but that contradictory information is not.  In my opinion a false picture is created.  An alternative to this aggrieved approach is to observe what is.  This is not the same as judging all behaviors and people as equally valid or acceptable.  I am making negative judgements about this author's book.  I am not saying "she is a bad person" but "she has shown herself to have a bad attitude."  I do not mean to say that judgements are never OK.  That is a problem that Twenge rightly takes issue with.  But judgements, to be useful, in my opinion should be concrete, specific and narrow rather than sweeping and general.  It would mean, in this case, accepting the validity of the data.  "I understand that 'generation me' has suffered from the self-esteem movement."  what does that mean?  how do I address that topic without falling into the trap of viewing people as "bad?"  what will help correct the excesses of the movement?  what benefits have accrued from it?  There is a dark side to the culture of accepting authority in the 1950's.  Just read the book Karen by Marie Killilea.  Karen was born in 1940 with cerebral palsy and was rejected by most of society including some doctors, one of whom even expressed regret that in this society unlike China, she would not be killed.  Other children and their parents refused to play with her, with the mothers saying "how do I know why she's that way?"  She was not allowed to go to school even after she learned to walk and use her hands.  before that school was impossible after kindergarten.  there were no accomodations and nothing was wheelchair-accessible.  She had to be carried many places, in large part b/c of the lack of wheelchair accessibility.  There were no resources for physical therapy so her parents did it themselves.  They were called "bad" and "dirty" for having a "child like that."  Karen's story is one example of many many many stories that blighted the lives and decreased the opportunities of children and adults in the 1940's and 1950's.  In Karen's case, she had vastly expanded opportunity b/c her mother fought for her very strongly.  Karen's problem fitting in was not her disability.  It was the attitude of the people around her.  A disinterested analysis of self-esteem (disinterested is not the same as uninterested) would accept that the self-esteem movement was generated to correct previous errors and lack of opportunity.  This analysis would assume that the people who developed the self-esteem movement had good faith.  However, their embrace of these concepts led to negative consequences for themselves and especially, their children.  What can be done to ameliorate the situation?  The author also says things that are quite outrageous and untrue.  She asks us to assume that no one in the 1950's challenged women's roles.  Yes some people did.  She needs to read or reread her biography of Betty Friedan who did not produce The Feminine Mystique in 1963 out of nothing.  She had been researching it and talking to like-minded people for years.  also, the film Mona Lisa Smile, which the author decries for its lack of accuracy, shows an art teacher challenging women's roles at an all-women's school.  I am certain some teachers did this.  Women of that generation grew up with more independence, ex. in WW2 for some of them, and then they lost it.  I believe Friedan quotes such individuals as expressing very serious concerns about women's roles in the 1950's.  Additionally, the character portrayed is an artist and artists are not known for accepting the prevailing worldview quietly and peacefully.  They are often if not usually angry and oppositional to some degree at least.    She makes an equally outrageous error when she states that no one challenged McCarthyism.  Many people did.  yes too many of them suffered for it but they saw it for the absurdity it was.  Strikingly, I do not see a thoughtful analysis of the roles of Jews in this book who have often fought hard for more individual freedom including freedom of expression.    I could fill a 20-page review with such examples as this.  When she restricts herself to her data, she is on solid ground.  When she goes beyond it to make pejorative generalizations about strangers, especially from an omniscient perspective "people must have done this" "they must have thought that"  "this behavior was good and useful" - without an examination of its dark side - there she is on shaky ground.  The most telling sign of an author who fails to be disinterested is the use of a 2 or 3 sentence anecdote followed by a moral.  This is a superficial shallow treatment of almost any issue in my opinion.  If all of the morals tend towards the same conclusion, the value of such moralizing is negligible b/c the analysis is so simplistic that contradictory information is lost.  In certain extreme examples, such as the Holocaust, a strong moral can be drawn.  Ironically the Holocaust shows the dangers of passively accepting the social order and failing to challenge it.  It also shows that looking out for one's own is a flawed way of living.   bottom line:  in my opinion another book should be written.  my suggestion is to keep the author's data and lose her attitude.  someone who is truly thoughtful and neutral could make a substantial contribution by doing this 
 I've had this coffeemaker for two weeks. I bought it because I had an old Mr. Coffee that worked fine, but was white and stained.  I liked that this was black and looked sleek.  The very second time I used it, the off button stuck, so you can no longer turn off the machine, but have to wait for it to turn itself off.  Also, EVERY pot has grounds in it.  I'm using the filters that came with it, and have never even filled it to capacity, and I can't figure out why there are ALWAYS grounds in my coffee.  Piece of junk.  Don't buy it 
 I'm usually the last person to want to disparage someone's art, and it's clear that Mr. Roeder has a great deal of affection for his characters.  Perhaps a bit too much.  This isn't a bad book, per se, but it certainly isn't very good.  The death trap for any writer is when s/he gets into the habit of telling and not showing.  That's a pitfall Mr. Roeder has not yet learned to avoid.  Brevity can be your friend as well.  I just don't know how the story can both move along too slowly, but also too quickly, but there we are.  I must also confess that I find the novel's denouement to be at least a teensy bit irresponsible, especially for a work that seems to be directed toward gay youth 
 I was very excited to see this frame, and thought that would be a perfect gift for a fellow geek. I was extremely disappointed to see poor the picture quality - it looked like the photos were taken using one of the first generation digital cameras that came on the market some 10 years ago. The resolution was similar to my first palm pilot (IIIx), just enlarged.  I sent it back after trying to get it to display pictures where you could actually see peoples faces. I believe that the pictures of this device showing colorful and detailed images were doctored or transposed to make this product look better 
 The idiots have struck again!  Ruined a beautiful film by cutting it up to fit a tv screen..are they all insane?!!! If I hadn't opened it, I would return it to amazon now! A flim that was shot in a wide screen format should be shown on the small screen that way. The directors vision has been ruined again by money grubbing fools!  Don't buy it 
 This may be great a product, but you won't find out through Amazon. After waiting months and getting numerous postponement e-mails from Amazon, I finally cancelled my order. Although Amazon claims this DVD is available, I have a feeling I was never going to receive it. If you're interested, I suggest looking for another vendor 
 On disk # 2 some of the tracks "skip" when played and are inaubible.  Have not yet played all of the disks, but was disappointed to find this lack of quality - especially when the book topic stresses the importance of quality. 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 I have been in practice for over 25 years, treating adults and children alike, I have read many books on the subject of ADD and ADHD and frankly I found this book to be full of the same old sham treatments that don't work any better than snake oil.

 This book makes some decent statements. However, Korten goes way overboard on his assault, and in doing so ends up "throwing the baby out with the bath water".  What I wish Korten would write is "WARNING - if we are not careful, corporations and the short term goals that they inspire CAN and WILL ruin not only the planet, but your life and life as we know it". But so will any organization that is left unchecked (think of 1984 and/or Brave New World for excessive examples of both). Korten warns that corporations have the potential to be excessive in their quest for greed, and that is true. However, corporations are made of people, and if people decide to give their lives over to greed, then yes, there will be consequences. Korten never really says this, but it is obvious -- life is more than just work, and it is every person's individual responsibility to think about the values of life beyond just simple greed. This means (I think) sharing a healthy passion for improving your position economically in life, but also balancing it with other equally important needs - love, family, friends, environmental balance, love for your neighbor (regardless of territorial boundaries), etc...  Korten's attack on corporations is excessive and looks at the worst case scenario in every sense, and then finds a way to place the blame on business. He tells you about all the people that he has seen misplaced over the years due to terrible economic corporate greed. However, is it just corporations that are at fault here, or could it also be politicians, local police, warlords, lack of execution, or any other things that could have made a situation bad. Korten decides that it is the fault of corporations and leaves it at that.  Korten also likes to talk about all of the failures of capitalist societies and how evil greed and pro business leaders caused all of this pain. I agree with him that there is no government in the world that is perfect, and the US (the leader of corporate society) has many skeletons in the closet of history, but the US history is also one of constant improvement, relentlessly seeking to improve the balance between companies, individuals, and the different elements that make up all of life. The "Robber Barons" was a chapter of US history that was excessive, but it was also one that was ultimately fixed (or balanced), and after this was done the US not only emerged as one of the strongest economic powers, but also a place that immigrants loaded onto boats by the thousands to come to. And yes, this was a CHOICE that they made - no corporation forced them to come.  Korten (as well as the first review of this book) goes into talking about how even Adam Smith was opposed to large corporations. To quote, (page 81) "Smith... opposed any form of economic concentration on the ground that it distorts the market's natural ability to establish a price that provides a fair return on land, labor, and capital". This is incorrect. What Smith opposed was any economic force that led to COLLUSION or MANIPULATION of the markets away from their free workings. Today free market principles are espoused and they should be. When they are not, and often times they are not, we are dependent on the courts and our elected officials to rectify the problem. Sometimes this works and sometimes it does not, but simply saying that corporations are bad (and Adam Smith says so too) is just wrong. Free market capitalism is a work in progress...  I could go on, but I will give one last example of Korten's excess. On page 76, he talks about the beliefs of free market ideologues. He writes "These beliefs are based on a number of explicit, underlying assumptions... (1) Humans are motivated by self interest, which is expressed primarily through the quest for financial gain. (2) The action that yields the greatest financial return to the individual or firm yields the most benefit to society. (3) Competitive behavior is more rational for the individual that cooperative behavior and ultimately more beneficial for society. (4) Human progress and improvements in well-being are best measured by increases in the aggregate market value of economic input."  OK, fair enough - this seems to be a fair statement in general. However, Kurton then puts his EXPERT OPINION on things to work. He then interprets all of this in the next paragraph when he says "To put it in harsher language, these idealogical doctrines assume that: (1) People are by nature motivated only by greed. (2) The drive to acquire is the highest expression of what it means to be human. (3) The relentless pursuit of greed and acquisition lead to socially optimal outcomes. (4) The interests of human societies are best served by encouraging, honoring, and rewarding the above values." This jump to "harsher langauge" is absurd.  Reading this, I just cannot see how Korten is looking at this with any sort of objective lens. To reinterpret the first set of thoughts into the second is just a ridiculous leap and assumes that all people in large corporations must be Gordon Geckos. This type of comparison is made time and time again in this book and is the reason I don't think his arguments can truly hold much weight other that one off examples of corporate ills.  In the end, Korten does have some points. If you, or society, or the world, cannot understand the difference between economic growth and happiness/quality of life, then we are all in trouble. However, I give the world more credit than that. It is not a perfect world to say the least, but just because there are some problems in certain areas, we should not be totally against that area. While throwing out the bathwater of economic growth and improving qualities of life, let's make sure to hold on to the baby that we are trying to take care of 
  "Nothing's okay," Westgate Penitentiary inmate Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) says, "I gotta get out."  That's because the sadistic screws are keeping the otherwise tractable inmates down with BRUTE FORCE.  You treat a man like an animal and he turns into one, right?   At least so sayeth the usually reliable director Jules Dassin in this overripe movie about a prison on the edge of explosion.  You see, the bad guys - the inmates - have a backstory, told in a series of flashbacks, that proves they're good guys under the prison grays.  They just got hooked up with bad women who made them do bad things.  Flashbacks don't lie.  They don't necessarily entertain, or keep a movie chugging onward at a comfortable clip, but they don't lie.  The prison officials, on the other hand... the otherwise decent warden is weak and vacillating.  The avuncular doctor drowns his reprehension in brandy, emerging from his alcoholic stupor  periodically to crack wry about the inhumanity of it all.   The baddest good guy is Capt. Munsey (`Sir' to you), Hume Cronyn, an effete sociopath with a blood taste for dishing it out (he seems particularly fond of whips) and a penchant for the insinuating seduction.     I wanted to like it, but as BRUTE FORCE plodded forward, piling melodramatic excess on melodramatic excess, I found myself fighting it.  Fighting the notion that everyone in effective authority was a heartless goon, the ineffective ones were broken (presumably by the ruthless System), and the inmates were misunderstood choirboys.  Despite its good looks, good performances and exciting final scene I had too many "Aw, c'mon" moments to honestly say I liked this movie.     The transfer print is in good condition, and the disk includes a hands-free Stills Pressbook Gallery with a number of behind-the-scene photographs, publicity stills, lobby cards and posters. 
  I'm a nineth grader in a small town and am being told to read this book for my English class. My teacher spent valuable budget money on a class set of this junk and I'm severely appalled.  First thing first, this book is hardly appropriate for a guy to read and is not school suitable, either. It also contains a good deal of profain language.  It appears to have the capability of reverse physcology and is definately dangerous. If you're shallow enough to just take it with a grain of salt and only read enough to write the report....it's great, but if you read into it......it's just strange. It almost encourages anorexia nervosa. Definately plenty of stereotyping as well.  Good punctuation, though....kudos to the editor.   Verdict: Not Suitable for Teenage Girls, Guys of any Age, High School Students, and of-their-rocker English teachers.  Anabelle W., Age 1 
 This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. "Saturday Night Fever" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.  I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.  Physically, Beales is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.  But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.  The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out "the Limey" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.  Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right ("Saturday Night Fever" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director. It's a shame 
 I would have to say that I don't particularly agree with this book.  I mean, in my opinion, the most important thing about an apple is that it is food, not that it is round.  Regardless, it did provide for an interesting conversation in my 2nd grade class, as well as a fun get-to-know-you activity.  After reading the book, disucssing differing view points, each student created a page about "The most important thing about me is_____".  
 This is the 3rd book I read from Frederica Mathewes-Green & I am sorry to write that I am very disappointed. The past 2 books, "Facing East" & "At the Corner of East & Now" were written with a clean, clear, & personal view of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in America, but this book dealt with fictional characters from the past that seem out of place. Why not write about factual characters? There is almost 2000 years of Church history through several cultural/language groups of factual people that lived & pratice this religious/spiritual lifestyle who could of been written about. Also there are many Church Fathers & Christian Mystics that have given us information on Mystical prayer (silent prayer or Jesus prayer) that could give us a more balance & fuller perspective on spiritual transformation. May I suggest studying some of the Church fathers like St. Symeon the New Theologian or St. Theophan the Recluse 
 Only read Cliff's Notes if your desperate, because the book is absolutly fabulous.  You're robbing yourself of a great book if you decide to skip the book and read the Cliff's Notes 
 I wish I could rate it lower than a 1.  It's far worse and more blatant than Rick Warren's Purpose Driven Church.  I found it interesting to note that he teaches you how to get rid of dissenters before he teaches you how to listen to legitimate complaints.   After seeing their fellow church members kicked out, how will people with 'legitimate concerns' be willing to come forward?  The church growth apostasy (yes, APOSTASY) is taking over all denominations.  I have seen it in Evangelical Covenant (rampant there) and being pushed on the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod (you can see it all over their website in their 'igniting congregations campaign') Mennonites, Baptists, and the list is endless.  The older saints who just want the pure word of God, realizing that adding all the trappings to it is just distracting from the truth, are called 'sanballats' (leaders from hell).  What a respectful way to treat fellow believers who may very well have legitimate concerns.   Take a stand against this apostasy.  It will come to your church 
 There is WAY TOO MUCH going on in this story..Hollywood glamour, Indian mythology, Anthropology, Domestic violence...rates down with romance novels. This is definately not the author's best. I am thinking of giving up on it. A BIG disappointment! 
 Perhaps reading this book from the vantage point of 2006 is a mistake, but I thought I'd enjoy Drucker's big picture thinking about the topic of the knowledge economy.  Drucker's discussion of the rise of the knowledge worker in today's society was only a quarter of this book.  This book is really a series of essays that lacked coherence as a whole.  I would recommend "The Essential Drucker" instead, to the reader looking for a good compilation of Drucker's insights.  
 As another reviewer states the original had 150 color plates this version has only 8 in mine. The visual phenomena are so complex that without the plates you can't possibly accurately understand what the book is talking about. Sure you could make you own examples, but if you did, you would NOT be sure, given the complex examples, that you understood what the author was talking about. Instead you will have a false understanding or incomplete understanding that will make you look foolish. The publisher is cashing in on the author's previous great work without really republishing it. This is the lowest I've ever rated a book 
 Birch once again gives us more information about herself than is needed.  Check out Donna Farhi's "Yoga: Mind, Body and Spirit" for a more thorough examination of the subject matter without all of the self-important jibber-jabber 
 I've been a Sonic Youth fan since "Bad Moon Rising" and have loved or at least liked/respected all their releases up until this one. I was expecting good work from this band as their two previous albums: "Washing Machine" and "A Thousand Leaves" were so good and pointed in a new direction for Sonic Youth, but NYC is a bummer. Sonic Youth have made a career of mixing chaos and structure in interesting and moving ways. But on NYC the band sounds simultaneously lazy, unconvincing, and very pretentious. Most of the songwriting is simply boring/lifeless and the improvised parts drone on and on in endless, random plinking and feedback jams that go nowhere. Perhaps 20 years ago the improvs would have been considered avantgarde, today they just sound dated and listless. To be fair, a couple of the pieces are very good, but most of the songs on NYC are amelodic, texturally uninteresting, limp and really boring. It's as though they forgot they were a rock band with avant garde elements and became an Art Ensemble with pretentions towards making rock, except without the energy. "Songs are just so bourgeois." Sorry but Thurston Moore is no beat poet no matter how hard he tries and quite often comes off as a self-indulgent amateur. The band sound WAY too full of themselves on this release. This CD almost killed the band for me. Luckily I listened to Murray Street and was very pleasanly suprised, likewise Sonic Nurse which is one of the best recordings of their career.  There's a lot of life left in this band yet, just skip this one. It's easily their worst album 
 The arrangements in this book are maddeningly inaccurate. They range from boring to bad. If you're a fan of Beatles composition, chords and harmonies you'll be very disappointed 
 It's summer, and my reading matter always lightens up significantly! I spotted this book at the library and figured, why not!  I know, I said never again for Danielle Steel, but the plot interested me.  How bad could it be, right?    Well, there's good news and bad news.  The good news is that the plot is different for DS, and held my interest enough so that, unlike Impossible, I actually finished it in one day.  The bad news is that this book seems entirely devoid of any attempt at editing.  The repetition is maddening. When reading becomes a chore, and you can skip entire pages and not miss anything, it's time to start some serious editing.    Here are some suggested areas of improvement:  - Shorten up the paragraphs.  They should not exceed a page! - Try spending a little more time developing the characters.  I couldn't "see" Sarah - when I read, I want to be able to clearly visualize the people and after hundreds of pages, I never had a clear vision of the main character - Pay attention to style. Every time she spelled out 30,000, I wanted to pull my hair out.  Small thing, but numbers over nine should always be written in numerals unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.  As I've written before, DS needs a good editor. This book could have been one of her best to date.

 Very poor choice for a cover photo. Jason should have been a man and took off his mask. This is really a book for diehard redsox fans only. The avrage baseball fan will choke on it. Stephen king should stick to what he does best,, Horror. Maybe he should write about this Redsox season 
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage 
 Reality Bites seemed fresh when it was first released, giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of "X" - that was overeducated, underemployed, plagued by the flashy, trashy commercialism of MTV, and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college.    It was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass, cruel arena of materialism can be tough, providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth - the very stuff of real movies.  Instead we have a swan dive into a Pizza Hut commercial held together by a plot so shop-worn it would have been considered exhausted in 1930.  Winona Ryder is winning as Lelaina, but one can only imagine the SATs of football players at a college where she is valedictorian.  Her "documentary" is appallingly narcissistic, reflecting the characteristic Gen X notion that - "if it's about me, it's art, and it's important."  Ethan Hawke does an excellent job as Troy, the very archetype of self-satisfied, supercilious entitlement.  We are expected to root for him, but it's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus.  Stiller, who directed - a talented fellow almost impossible to look at - plays Michael, the "anti-Troy."  Smooth, successful, and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of Gen X culture - if culture is the right word - he's an executive at an MTV-ish corporation.  That he improves Lelaina's preposterous "documentary," rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity, is the film's dirty little secret.  Viewers surprised by who wins Lelaina's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and Liberace was gay.  Indeed, when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie.  Janeane Garofalo is outstanding as always, and John Mahoney shines as the TV morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact, a bastard.  His performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film - or on TV - than the rest of this film put together.  In fact, reality is great, this picture would have benefited from some 
 I have say that I am pretty disapointed in the over all production of the DVD. It would never stand up against the David Mallet attention to detail of the "Music and Passion" DVD.  First of all the video is way over saturated thoughout because the concert is not really lite for television at all. At best it's a 4 or 5 camera shoot with no crowd flybys or jib shots. It looks worse if you watch it on an HD monitor. The audio is even worse than the video. It sounds like they took a 2 channel board mix and attempted to peel off a 5.1 surround mix which is not very clean. The audio is very thin with a weak mid-range and a very poor bass mix. I had to crank my sub-woofer all the way up just to hear the bass and it still is not that great. Finally, Barry Manilow in the round is really nothing to watch. I love him and would rather see the band behind him rather then in a pit off stage. He looks alone and the composition of the shots are flat and unbalanced. He also looks uncomfortable because it.  The production numbers are hard to watch and average at best. Dave Koz is big help on "Brooklyn Blues" but hard to see because they never throw a spotlight on him. At least not a good one.   Barry is strong as ever though. I guess I got my 13 dollars worth but given the chance to but this DVD again knowing what I now, I wouldn't buy it.  Sounds like I'm a snob but I'm not. I'm spoiled on HD and have high television standards. Quality sound and video are a must these days.    I hope he teams up with David Mallet again. I'll buy that DVD.  Sorry Barry. This one just doesn't stand up to the others.  S. 
 Michael and Eve have been living together and now they're engaged due to Eve's ultimatum. Eve is 36 years old and has never been married. Michael has been married before and has a daughter Phoebe. He is reluctant to make a commitment despite Eve's best efforts. Every action and behavior has a motive for Eve regarding Michael. Now that she's got a ring; as she says "just add diamonds, instant-shrew". Every time they have an argument she's quick to take off her ring. Too much is made of her subscription to Bride magazine. I had a hard time finding any empathy for Eve. You hardly hear or see Michael. It had its moments but overall I was not impressed. 
 This DVD is basically a come-on to entice you to enroll in Villoldo's school.  When I read the intro in the Gaiam catalog, where I first saw this video and ordered it, it read as an instructional video.  Even on the back of the DVD cover itself there is an inference that it is more than just a presentaion of infomation.  I genuinely thought this was an instructional video and it most definitely is not.  I was hugely disappointed.  I regret spending the money for this video.  If you're wanting a How-To then pass this one up!  I gave it a one-star rating simply because there wasn't a lower choice 
 The story of the rise of Def Jam is a fascinating part of hip hop history because, in many respects, it laid the groundwork for hip hop as we know it.  Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin are arguably the Wright Brothers of hip hop because they took an artistic genre (rap) and contrary to popular corporate opinion - which did not believe rap would be anything more than a passing fad - made it fly.  This book details the rise of Def Jam from its beginning in Rick Rubin's NYU dorm room to the present.  Even though the story is very interesting, the book is poorly written on a number of levels.  First, Stacy Gueraseva worked as the Editor-in-Chief for one of Simmons' magazines and her bias to her former employer clearly shows through.  There is very little critical analysis of the negative side of this company (e.g. its glorification of violence, guns and the objectification of women).  Second, Gueraseva often fails to tell the entire story of specific characters in the book.  For example, the most compelling figure in Def Jam's history is Lyor Cohen, who was with the company for over 20 years and figures prominently throughout the entire story.  Unfortunately, the author does not fully explain his personal history (like she does with Rubin and Simmons).  We get only tidbits of his personal bio - e.g. he is Israeli, he went to the University of Miami, he is a "family man" now.  He is obviosuly different than most people in the Def Jam story but for some unknown reason, the author does not elaborate on his personal story.  You get to the point where you want to yell at her "ok, tell us more about him!" but she never does.  Additionally, the author spends a lot of time detailing Def Jam's rise in the 1980s but only gives the post-1995 era a short look.  I feel the rise of Jay-Z to President of Def Jam is one of the most interesting developments of Def Jam Era but we only get about 3 paragraphs discussing this part.  Finally, the writing is extremely average.  The sentence structure was repetitive and there were several grammatical errors.  It was quite noticeable and took away from the flow of the story.  In all, even though this is an interesting story, it deserved a better researched and written history 
 I don't get all the rave reviews here.  I've owned this CD since it came out in 1997 and its been probably more than 5 years since I had a desire to listen to it.  Now listening to it trying to figure out what I want to put on my I-pod and I really can't find anything other than the 1st 2 tracks, which are great.  The Filter/Crystal Method track is a classic.  But beyond that I just find the songs somewhere between mildly interesting and boring.  I am a fan of many of the rock & electronic artists here, but this experiment just didn't pan out in my opinion.  It's been 10 years and I haven't seen any other collections like this so I must not be in the minority.  Nice try, but there is not much more here beyond the concept 
 This book is very basic and very very standard stuff it makes me wish I could go back and change my review of Paul Vunaks "Anatomy of a Streetfight" and give him a higher score because he puts alot more useful info in his book. I really wasn't impressed by this book you would be better off buying Paul Vunak's book or even Diallo Frazier's "Revelations of a Warrior 
 I just reviewed the other cd and like i said its a waste of your money. Save your money for something valueable 
 Not that I know everything about crime - especially getting away with it - but A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM made it look too easy. Performances by Michael Caine as a done-wrong-now-doin'-wrong angry executive and Will Patton as  the police detective who is wise to him make the film worth a look on  television.  But A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM needed to close a few holes in its  story to make it worthy of your movie theater/home video payment

 More To Life Than This starts off describing an almost idyllic marital/family relationship which lacks a bit of spice and passion.  The opening scene has the husband and wife happily wiling away a weekend afternoon on a garden tour while their perfect children skip down the cobblestone path.  Stop right there.  The husband is happy to be on a garden tour?  The children aren't whining and complaining that they want to go home?  That's right.  Who then is complaining?  The wife!  Apparently this scene is too perfect, leaving Kate with a sense of discontent and asking herself if there's more to life than this.  Wow.  Who can relate to this?   Realistic to me would be a husband who would prefer to watch sports or play golf on the weekend, but reluctantly goes on a garden tour after the wife cajoles him into it and children who loudly proclaim how "boring" a garden tour is.  I think more people can relate to that!  The feeling of "is there more to life than this" is familiar, but not given the perfect children and exceedingly supportive husband as laid out in the opening scene.  Given her malaise and unhappiness, Kate decides to escape for a week and places a hot nanny in charge of her husband and goody-two shoes children.  At this point I want the sweet, if slightly wimpy husband to chuck the ungrateful wife for the sexy Aussie.  That's when I realize that I cannot finish this book.  The "heroine" elicits no sympathy from this average reader.  Note to author: next time try creating a character that we can all relate to-someone akin to the Calgon take-me-away woman who needs a bath to escape her screaming children.  
 Much as this reader enjoyed Mary Gordon's other writing, especially Final Payments, he must fault the writer for this maundering, meandering piece of work.  Bloviated with rhetorical questions, she plows the same ground over and over again, bemoaning her fate, and crying out, "Why?  Why?"  One is tempted to respond, "Because.  Because."  Without the self-conscious and self-serving rhetorical questions, this book would be 1/3 shorter, and it would be improved.  If you've ever fantasized about being a psychiatrist, wondering what it would be like to listen at length to someone who refuses to accept life, this book should satisfy you.  For the rest of us, let's hope that Gordon finally accepts herself.  Frankly, Kathryne Harrison's The Kiss was more fully honest and better written 
 I hate to say this about a classic, but--I found this book incredibly boring 
 For someone who spends his career attacking politically-motivated science, Stephen Jay Gould does a pretty good job combining scientific research with politics in this book. Gould rambles on and on, attacking giants of modern science like Samuel Morton and Francis Galton, and never putting up any serious scientific conclusions of his own. Gould presents fabricated objections to serious research and selectively excludes studies that make a clear correlation between intelligence and brain and skull size as well as differences in brain size between the human population groups and correlations between brain size and class. Gould only ridicules the most outlandish claims of scientific racism and refuses to pick on findings that have been proven correct. For anyone who has no knowledge of biology, this book will give them a very distorted view of the entire science. Stephen Jay Gould is a paleontologist; evolutionary biology is an amateur field for him, and it would be best if he, as well as all other crypto-Marxists who wish to blend science and politics, stay out of it 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 This book deserves no stars.   PLEASE stop buying and promoting this rotten book! This is a book about a rotten, selfish self-centered male who takes everything including the life of the female tree. Even at the end when he chops her down to sit on her as an old man, he's still unsatisifed and has a big scowl on his face!  The female tree gives and gives and gives, and the male (from boy to old man) just takes and takes and takes and is never satisified, happy or thankful.  What kind of story is that?  This is truly a rotten story. Don't buy it! Don't give this to your children! 
 This is the first Patterson novel I have ever read, and it is certain to be the last.  Most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in-depth characters, but Patterson does none of that.  The author's writing style is akin to that of a small child's, as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one-dimensional characters.  Patterson then holds the reader's hand as he matter-of-factly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation, presenting a book written by a Ralph Wiggums-like child for immature children to enjoy.  How does the reader know Alex was scared? The reader knows because Patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style: "The man pulled out a gun, Alex was scared, Alex shot the man and he was happy, and the man was dead."  Don't believe me? Simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch-nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare I had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who I thought he killed, or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist's evil deeds.  Quite simply, this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs 
 The book was filled with many pages of interesting info that I found informative and enjoyable to read as a literature teacher. It was composed with inciteful quotes that can influence the reader.  Finally, I would  advise anyone interested in reading about a great man like this one should  go out and buy this boo 
 Of course you have to read this book if you want to complete the final book of this series but it took me a month to read it because of how bad it is. I can't believe how they make Bart in this book. As strong as Cathy was in the others I am surprised at her reactions to her own son. I would have killed him or sent him away for life regardless if he was my son or not. The ending seems very rushed and horribly done 
 I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its "functionality" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being "propelled through every foot", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement.  BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.    *** UPdate *** November 15, 2006 It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible 
 Berkhof was the sine qua non of Reformed systematics texts for generations of American seminary students, pastors and theologians. He will still reward a close reading and sharpen the mind. The two stars are for the publisher, NOT THE CONTENT. Shame on Eerdmans! The production of this edition is a sloppy, careless bit of work not worthy of the memory of Louis Berkhof. Seminary students and pastors should consider the Banner of Truth edition instead: http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/item_detail.php?438 
 OK- the 1st time I heard of Gaitskill was when I saw Secretary & that was based on her story in "Bad Behavior". "Bad Behavior" I thought was mediocre, but had some potential. This book I found terribly dull. The characters are cliched abuse cases & the situations are predictable. The one story from where the title is taken is about a 16 yr old runaway who baby sits for a mother who never comes home that night. Then that's it. The conversations are not insightful, in fact there's really not much to say about them at all. I felt this was a very lazy book. For a better read, I recommend Emily Carter's "Glory Goes and Gets Some." While not all the stories are great, many are very good & the books have similar tropes- with Carter's dealing with someone with HIV/drugs & Gaitskill's with sex & whatever else. Yet Carter's is far superior because her descriptions are much more insightful & the characters more developed. Just goes to show you how it's not the subject matter, but the way something is written that makes it work 
 Two riders have ridden off into the sunset since the release of Enjoy the melodic sunshine. One of them, Daniel Wylie, has since carved out a solo career thru three solo albums that are a match for that beautiful record. Who knows what happened to the other guy, but what is clear is that the three remaining riders are heading for anonymous oblivion with this awful record. Someone must've told them it would be a good idea to impersonate early U2 but whoever it was forgot to tell them you need to add great songs to the mix for it to work. This album lacks good songs. The averageness of the material is saddeningly frightening. A band who was king of the hill are now licking the souls of the good bands. I'm only hearing one great song. Emptiness is that one sole cracker and shows up the rest of the toons for what they are. Sub standard. I can't believe what I'm reading on here when others compared a coupla the toons to the Beatles. Gulp! You got to be joking. You're reading like a marketing person for the band in disguise. I know we all hear it our own way, so I'd say try to hear the record before you part with your cash. 
 According to Richard Montauk, a sucessful law career can only be acheived by graduating from an Ivy League law school. He isn't even practicing law at this point! Instead, he's taking the money of naive prospective law students. This book is not particularly well-written or helpful. The information it contains is nothing new or astounding. In fact, the only thing I really learned from this book is that Richard Montauk is an egotisical, money-hungry bore. 
 I got spoiled with the original Midnight Castle and Escape from Catrina specials when I was a kid. The artwork, songs, voice work and creativity in those two far outshine ANY pony movie or TV show released to date.   This DVD was not worth the $10 I paid for it, frankly. The artwork and animation was horrible, and the plot was terrible. The whole idea of the bees just made me shake my head. And the witches reminded me of Gargamel from the Smurfs.    Even the new Minty Christmas... the ponies have lost some of their charm by making them really bubbly and annoying characters with twitchy habits and nothing much other than fluff and shiny happiness in their lives or average daily problems to solve.   What happened to the dragons? What happened to the castles (The traditional, non-balloony-goofy castles)? And hey, even good villains like The Darkness and his horned minion helps bolster a good show! He really caught my attention, and I LOVED the sequences where the captured ponies got transformed into black dragons. We moved from a Renaissance theme set for the original storyline to this kind of... muddled, weird new-age setting. The Renaissance setting was better. Why the heck don't you release the original Midnight Castle UNEDITED to include all the original songs, and then follow it up with a "Return of the Darkness" or "Darkness Returns" in the original style?? It could work. I'd probably like it a lot better than End of Flutter Valley 
 How sad it is to see what began as a fun series of books end this way. The only good thing in this book is the departure of Polly.  She was much too staid for Qwilleran who needs some fun in his life.  Years ago we did not understand why the author "bumped off" the doctor love interest, suddenly turning her into a villain.  The series began to take on a certain listlessness.  That said, I would like to see Mrs Braun find a competent and enthusiastic co-author who can restore the original concept because Koko and Yum Yum deserve to go out in a blaze of glory.  Besides I would like to know if the barn actually was destroyed by the fire, even if Qwill himself didn't bother to find out 
 The first near-half of this books was fascinating: an analysis of how the concept of "space" developed in the West as Europe moved from the medieval era and into the Renaissance.  Wertheim examines the concept of space as perceived through the art, science, and philosophies of the era in enough depth have been worth the read, if not as much depth as one might desire.  The second half is something of a loss.  The chapters on 20th-century science read like nothing more than a condensed re-hash of most popular physics books of the last 10 years.  The final chapters -- where we reach the long-promised "cyberspace" -- say nothing more than her introduction: that there are similarities between utopian visions of the digital future and the Christian conception of heaven. Similarities between a utopia and heaven?  Not exactly a shocking thesis and even less shocking as a conclusion. 
 I'm a guitar player that decided to pick up the drums as a second instrument, and also to help in developing a better sense of rhythm.   In the course of my studies, I happened across the DD-20C, and it seemed to offer some really nice features for what seemed like a reasonable price. The unit itself has 10 preassigned drum kits, plus the ability to assign your own custom setup. In addition, it offers 16 special effects, 4 drum roll effects, adjustable tempo, and 100 different styles to play along with which cover a wide range of genres. Not only that, but it offers the package in a very intuitive interface that will get even the rank beginner up and going quickly. Sounds like a pretty nice deal, right? It would be... if it worked like it's supposed to.   Actually I'm on my second set right now, and this one is about to go back for a refund. The first set I had the pads were so insensitive as to make the unit nearly unplayable. What I mean by this is that there was maybe a square inch or so of a sweet spot where the pads would sound at all, and even then I really had to strike hard. The second set I'm on now is far better in response than the first, but still falls short of acceptable.   For starters, the pads don't feel like a real drum skin at all. If one were to compare against an acoustic snare drum for example, the snare has a certain "bounce" to it that this unit doesn't have. Basically the pads absorb most of the impact, and this in turn makes doing any kind of fast work or rudiments all but impossible.   Also, even though my second set is more responsive from the first, I have found that it still takes a considerable amount of force in comparison to a real drum to get the pads to sound off. Keep in mind that the pads themselves are only 4 inches or so in diameter... an actual snare starts at 12". In all fairness though, I really can't hold the pad size alone against the DD-20 as Yamaha did have to keep the overall size and cost manageable, and in reality if there weren't the feel and responsiveness issue, the pad size should be sufficient. HOWEVER, when these combined factors are taken into consideration, I have found that it makes for a frustrating experience.   My opinion for what it's worth, is that new drummers who are looking to the DD-20 to learn on should do it the old-school way, and start with a quality practice pad instead. They are considerably less expensive (a ReelFeel 12" pad and sticks will run about half of what this unit costs), indestructible, easier to work with, and offer at least a reasonable approximation of the feel of a real drum. Not only that, but a pad also inherently allows for quiet practice.  Maybe Yamaha will fix the feel and sensitivity problems with the next revision of this drum set... then it might be worth it. Until then, I feel that the DD-20C is best avoided.  
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 Young Ely Braxton (Marcus Thomas) is an up and coming rodeo bull rider who suffers a movie opening Serious Injury.  Brother Hank (Kiefer Sutherland) is the responsible older brother who raises bulls, teaches a zen-ish style of bull riding (`Empty your heart of hate before you ride,' that kind of thing) and is a rodeo clown - the fellow who distracts the bull after its thrown his rider and, reasonably enough from the bull's point of view, wants to crush into pulp the prone body of the thrown rider.   I've kind of made a point of searching out and watching rodeo movies.  There aren't a lot of them, and most concentrate on the maverick qualities of the rodeo rider.  Always a bull rider, by the way.  Most, too, feature some heavy hitters - guys like Steve McQueen and Cliff Robertson - in the lead roles.  COWBOY UP is a little different.  Bull riding is more of a backdrop here, a setting against which sibling rivalry, a search for a lost father, and some sticky romantic entanglements can be played out.  Not that we don't get a LOT of slow-motion shots of mucus draining bulls bucking and snorting and doing their best to toss and trample their tormenters (again, `tormenters' from the bull's point of view.)  It's just there's a whole lot more soap than horse in this opera.   Which wouldn't be so bad if the second lead, Marcus Thomas, was a polished actor.  Unfortunately his one expression seems to be that of stunned introspection, as thought on the first day of the shoot a crew member had asked him a preposterous question that he couldn't get out of his head.  Thomas is talking to a grip, say, on that first day, and the grip wonders out loud whether birds would have to fly if they had opposable thumbs. Thomas guffaws, of course, but every time the studio lights fire up the question returns to gnaw at him, and when he should be `in the moment,' or whatever it is actors say, with movie girlfriend Connie (Molly Ringwald,) instead he's picturing a southbound autumn highway with clusters of hitchhiking ducks.     I'm not sure it matters, anyway.  The story's kind of an ill-fitting hybrid to begin with.  Things become more complicated later when young Ely hooks up with pretty rodeo horse rider Celia Jones (Daryl Hannah,) brother Hank's old flame, which supplies just enough plot to propel the film to the grand finale.  Ely's search for his missing father is resolved, although that search was so unstressed in the movie I didn't even realize it was a Big Issue until it was on me.  And, of course, as in almost all rodeo movies, Ely gets to ride the big bull, preferably the one who threw him earlier.  In this case the big bull is Zapata, one of brother Hank's bulls, in fact.   I've never been a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but he's great in this one.  Ringwald, Hannah, and Melinda Dillon - the mother in both `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and `The Christmas Story' - are wasted as sideline fodder who have little more to do than seduce or wring their hands and hope Ely gets some sense and give up the bull riding.  The highlight of the movie for me came when, while Hannah and Thomas were deep in their fling, Ringwald and Sutherland shared a piece of consolation pie at the local diner.  Ringwald, inevitably I guess, says to Sutherland, `In a different world you and I would have made a lot more sense.'  Hey, Molly - in a different and better movie you and Sutherland would have made a lot more sense, too.  	COWBOY UP might appeal to hard-core rodeo fans, but the rest of us would be better advised to steer clear of this one. 
 This is a very cool product, but there are a million knock-offs out there these days, and you can get them for as little as $10.00! They are almost totally identical, they look just as cool, they work just as well, and the only thing that the knock-offs don't generally have is the fancy wooden box.  Cost Plus World Market sells one for $20, and Linen N Things sells one for $9.99.  Some companies just don't get the idea of appropriate pricing 
 When I heard these songs I felt that there was something missing for me. True, I am not a die-hard fan. It's a shame that Rickie Lee never had the opportunity to cut a jazz duet with Chet Baker.  Or a pop duet with Bob Dylan. Their vocal styles would have mixed to perfection! However, all is not lost... hopefully she still has an opportunity to join her vocal skills with the talents of William Hung. You go girl 
 I love other Preston/Childs books so I thought I would love this one.  I didn't.  It is completely predictable.  I was sure that the author would give it some interesting plot twists, but there were none.  And parts of it were ridiculous:  the length of the entombment, the amount of the treasure, the manner of transport, etc.  The only character I really liked was the monkey 
 Oh Helen Gibb...what happened? I would highly recommend all 3 of her other books. I use them all the time for ideas and inspiration and they all teach something different. But this book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know. The front cover is the only design that I hadn't seen in any other Helen Gibb books. And of course this book shows you how to do that technique. But my first and best ribbon flower book is The Artful Ribbon, and it has the same technique in it only more variations of it. This book has a few bridal type ideas and other projects but it is seriously lacking all those beautiful vintage examples of fabulous creations that all the other Helen Gibb books have. It has some but not what I'm used to with the other books. It just seems to me that this book was cranked out in a hurry and I was very disappointed with it. I'm really considering sending it back. 
 I got through 5 chapters out of 12 before the ideas started to become repetitive and muddled. It was like someone who talks very fast, sharing every thought and theory without a clear idea of the desired outcome. Way too much jargon and Phrases That Were Needlessly Capitalized. Maybe useful as a text book, but for somone looking for a clear process to assist my organization, it really missed the mark. Oh, and the book started to fall apart the second time I picked it up. 
 There is some good writing in this book, but it is limited to about 100 pages out of 600 pages.  The main character, Alex Hawke, excuse me I mean Lord Alex Hawke, is a magical combination of James Bond, Austin Powers, Batman and Superman--he can do it all...around the world in a day.  He is friends with the President of the US, he's a British Lord called on to rescue a hostage from the Chinese, rescue the Sultan of Oman from a fortress, rescue NYC from a nuclear bomb, fly a $50 million stealth jet on loan from the USA to a US aircraft carrier.  Apparently the US Navy Seals, US pilots, etc don't exist in this book, as the Pres of the US, the CIA, Scotland Yard, etc rely solely on Lord Hawke to save the world.  Hawke is apparently in his young 30's too.  In the book, there is also the ego-maniacal descendant of Napoleon who murders his way to the top of the French Government.  There is also the Chinese version of Hannibal Lecter who is an assassin and total freak, The German industrialist Neo Nazi who are all scheming to take over the world.  They all meet with anti-climatic ends.  And of course Sir Alex Hawke gets the girl, a beautiful Chinese spy, actress, singer, diva, etc who, after one night with Sir Hawke, betrays her country, kills her evil twin sister, almost kills her father, betrays her ex-boyfriend, helps Hawke's friend Stokley, the 6'5 260lb ex Jets running back who sneaks into all of the enemies' lairs to help Hawke save the world.  The tone of the book varies from life and death serious to total tongue in cheek; it makes me think that even the author doesn't believe what he's writing.  Bell's new one is on the best seller list.  I guess that is what marketing can do for you 
 I was very excited when I got my copy of this book. I am a big fan of medical thrillers. I started with Robin Cook and Michael Palmer and from then on I was hooked. Unfortunately for me, I selected the wrong book. It was very slow and he didn't pick up the pace until I was about 60 pages from the end. Then all hell broke loose. I have a feeling that Josh got a little help from people telling him to "spice it up". All in all, I was disappointed and still don't know what PERV means. Hope he does better on his second. I will give it a try but only the first 50 pages. If he hasn't hooked me by then, I'll give up 
 This version (Workbook) of Modern Carpentry is a workbook.  Its questions that you must fill in the blank (answer).  It is NOT a book but more of a 'test' (I'm assuming) of the material in Modern Carpentry 
 "The Zahir" started out well, but about 100 pages into the book my interest level dropped.  It, in no way, mentally stimulated me.  I could not read one more page of the main character's self-indulgent and arrogant thoughts and actions.  I guess, if you are the type of person that needs to love the main character in order to read a novel, then this is not your book.  I couldn't stand him and I really hope that the main character isn't a reflection Paul Coelho.  I almost threw this book away, but I instead donated it.  I loved "The Alchemist." 
 This book is useless without the Brain Gym Teacher's Edition.  The teacher's edition explains how to do all the different exercises and what skills they work on.  The orange Brain Gym book is just a summary of all the moves.  I haven't used the orange book since I bought it a year ago...it was a waste of money.  I use the Teacher's Edition frequently.  If you want to incorporate Brain Gym into your classroom/clinic, buy the Teacher's Edition 
 My brother told me that Tyrese had a new album long before I knew about it. He went on to tell me that the album is called Alter Ego and that it's a double-disc: the first disc is Tyrese singing normally, while the second disc is him RAPPING as his alter-ego, Black-Ty. THEN my brother told me that Black-Ty's rapping is so bad that he'd rather listen to Kevin Federline. If that sounds harsh, it's actually pretty accurate.  But the sad thing is, the singing disc really isn't all that. It's a slim ten tracks, but there still really are no standouts. It's the same story with Tyrese: he's got one hell of a voice, but his lyrics are just terrible (Ruben Studdard would later follow in his footsteps, but I digress). I mean, "One" and the Lil Jon-assisted "Turn Ya Out" are okay, but they're no classics. "Better to Know" is a ridiculous song about having a lady as a F buddy rather than a girlfriend, and "Signs of Love Makin' Part 2" isn't much more interesting than its predecessor. Finally, "Hurry Up" doesn't rank as one of R. Kelly's best compositions.  As far as Black-Ty's disc, well, there are so many weak bars here that XXL could publish an entire Step Your Rap Game Up ISSUE with them (for example: "I ain't changed; I just changed my name and added a hyphen" from "What It Is"). I mean, honestly; one listen to Tyrese's rap during the third verse of "Nobody Else" told me point blank that he was clearly not a rapper, and this disc further proves that. Songs are wack enough when he's by himself, as evidenced by the tepid "Broke A** N's", but matters get even worse when guest stars come aboard. On "Get It In", a good Scott Storch beat is wasted by below-average rapping by both Ty and Method Man. And "U Scared" (with David Banner and Lil' Scrappy) has all sorts of problems. First, it has the non-threatening chorus: "You scared/You scared/You scared, MF/You scared". Then, Banner appears to be having trouble rapping over his own beat, and the beat itself sounds like a low-key version of Dr. Dre's beat from Eve's "Let Me Blow Ya Mind".  It gets worse from there. For some strange reason, Kurupt (who hasn't been dope since "Doggy Dogg World") shows up on four tracks, and he sounds like he doesn't even want this. "Fly Away" is a dumb track that showcases Ty and Kurupt giving encouraging words about their respective rap careers over a conference call. And "Get Low" is downright disgusting, but that's probably because the song also features Too $hort (as well as Kurupt and Snoop Dogg). Snoop and Kurupt also appear on "Roll the Dice", which sounds like a throwaway 213 song.  I don't know if there's really anything else to say about Tyrese, other than he STILL needs to get some serious writers. Rap ain't looking too bright for him, and although he's a good actor, no one ever sees the movies he's in. But he'd better get his mind right soon because Alter Ego isn't worth picking up.

 This wipe warmer does not function simply because the lid won't stay closed.  I waste time trying to get the lid closed while my baby is crying on the changing table.  The wipes cool off and dry out because of the poorly designed and flimsy lid.  Don't buy this wipe warmer, there are better ones out there. 
   I'm calling on all decent, patriotic Americans to boycott Newman's book.  I've had him for two US history courses and all he does is spout anti-american sentiments and convince students to hate America.  He would rather we'd never fought the revolutionary war because he believes the rich started the war and used the poor to get richer, never mind that Washington turned down kingship.  Do yourself a favor and don't listen to anything Newman has to say.  Don't waste your money buying a book from a man whose sole purpose is to spread anti-american propoganda to impressionable college students.      I swear, some of what he says about present-day America could come straight from an al-Qaida training video.  So steer clear of this literature terrorist 
 I am writing this primarily to warn people from wasting their time with this book.  I would write an exhaustive explanation of why this book is so bad, but I don't want to waste any more of my own time with this book.  For  an excellent book, read either THE FOUNTAINHEAD by Ayn Rand or ATLAS  SHRUGGED by Ayn Rand.  Actually, read *both* of them 
 I got one of these attractive looking boards and treated it with a beewax-based wood maintenance product. The board sucked up very little wax compared to my other boards.  After a good meal with friends I was prevented from doing the dishes right away and the board ended sitting for two days before cleaning. By this time it had collected mold that is situated deep into the surface of the board and which I regard impossible to remove. I haven't and didn't experience this with any other board. The board looks good (without mold) and is very resistant to cutting marks, but if you decide to get one you should probably make sure to clean it right away after any use. I do not know if this is a general characteristic of bamboo or a quality of this particular board. I would have appreciated a word of warning or a useful guide as to how the board needs to be treated differently from boards made of wood.  For my next board I will probably try to find an end-grain board made of American maple. American maple is significantly harder than European maple.  -- Tor 
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 At first this thing was great, in 20 minutes (not 15) it would charge the batteries.  The problems came later when batteries started showing up as "bad" according to the charger, even brand new ones.  A few at first then a lot more.  I have other travel chargers that would charge the "bad" batteries over 8 hours and they would work fine.  Often after this the Energizer charger would charge batteries previously identified as "bad."  After about a year I discovered that the charger was destroying the batteries.  New and old, they would end up bad after a few cycles through this charger, so that even the slow chargers would not charge them.  Many times the charger would not charge them at all, just wait 20 minutes and turn green as if they were done.  Not good when you discover dead "charged" batteries while taking pictures on vacation.  I'd recommend going with slower chargers, inconvenient as they are.  The super fast charge time has destroyed a few dozen expensive NiMH batteries.  I'm looking for one that'll charge a dozen at once....if they make one that is 
 I am a fan of weird cult and experimental films but El Topo becomes tedious after a while. It was one of the original "midnight movies" and probably worked better in that setting. El Topo (more interesting for its imagery than plot) comes off as a stoned, somewhat campy film highly derivative of Luis Bunuel, Arrabel (Viva La Muerte) and is similar to the early experimental films of Werner Herzog (Even Dwarves Started Small, Fata Morgana). That said if you've heard of all these films and are in the mood for a surrealistic, sacreligious western that drags on for a long time, then El Topo has its moments 
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
 I took the author to long to get to the point.  She went all around in circles to get to the poin 
 very sad to say that this is salty, no I mean SALTY! Will try something else for my son. Annie, please make these less salty and I will try them again 
 As a recent Econ Major from the University of Washington, I found the book outdated and inconsistent.  It had the nauseating sense of a political polemic dressed up as an "economic treatise."  I can only agree with a handful of his "realist" conclusions.    While reading Eat the Rich, I found the first few chapters on theory semi-humorous and the rest of the book dry, just like most economics texts.  Apparently the dismal science is humorless by definition.    As for Mr. O'Rourke's so called libertarian credentials, I would like to revoke them after reading this book and his romance pamphlet for the U.S. military (called Peace Kills).  Just because you are a member of the Cato institute, doesn't mean you are a consistent libertarian.  In fact, it probably makes you an inconsistent one.    Obviously I have more complaints, so I will save us both time and just relate one more.  Why would you seriously treat Albania as a capitalist country?  Then call it anarchist?  It seems that P.J. has a bit of an axe to grind here.  If he would have just looked at the Fraser institute's study on economic freedom - he would find Albania ranks number 91st in government regulation of business, 74th on protection of private property and 69th on the relative (taxed) size of government out of roughly a 100 countries.  Obviously Mr. O'Rourke hasn't done his research very well (or his empiricist radar was turned off) if I was able to do a similar analysis in a few moments without going to the country in question.  How can the 69th largest government be called "anarchist?"  I am truly puzzled.  (After looking at some of the recent historical data - I wonder if O'Rourke was asleep while writing this chapter.  I have been generous with my numbers for the former Communist country.)   All seriousness aside, I liked P.J.'s earlier stuff better, most notably "Parliament of Whores".   He is much funnier and seems to be more at home with politics.  Yet, from what I have seen, he is writing another book about economics - God spare us.  If you are truly interested in learning Economics - try Gene Callahan's "Economics for Real People." 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 I wouldn't waste my time buying anything from this company. We purchased the Train table for a Christmas gift and while assembling it on Christmas eve there were quality issues. Several drilled holes were not drilled in the proper position and the table surface had several deep scratches. I called and e-mailed the company several times to try and obtain replacement parts and never got a response. Most companies want you to contact them when you need replacement parts rather than returning it to the store, but not KidKraft 
 So far I've seen 67 out of 68 positive reviews for this book, and I say "Hurrah" for Richard Russo for all his positive praise. However, I disagree. The book has a flimsy to nonexistent foundation, that being backstory which takes circuitous twists and turns, and those turns take further turns.. So far I'm averaging 3 to 4 pages a night, and I'm a prolific reader. Why is Russo so fearful of forwarding the plot? Why the back and forth, the past histories upon past histories of every minor character? Just too much "muchiness" as the Brits would say 
 This vision of the future reminded me of common errors on physics tests where the student leaves out a variable or two and makes a wildly incorrect prediction of an object's future behavior.  People have many connections to a place, which do not depend merely on their own security or on currency fluctuations.  These emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and "at-will" citizens for a long time to come.  In reading the book, by the way, the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern, American style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends.  It's much more in an old fashioned English amateur gentleman scholar style where nothing is substantiated by anything and it's all sort of breezy.  Some may like that.  
 This book is a complete waste of paper.  The reader is subjected to page after page of disgustingly graphic descriptions of diarrhea (the author's), flatulence (the radio man's), the construcion and instructions for use of Afghan toilets and, not least, the "fact" that Afghan men wear long shirts so they can move their bowels in public and remain covered while doing so.  The author also appears to burst into tears at the slightest provocation (perhaps he bores himself to tears!) 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 I also bought this item.  Sent in all of the required documents, including original UPC.  Rebate denied because UPC was not included.  I emailed them 3 times stating that I did in fact enclose it .  Also quoted the number from the copy of it that I retained.  To date, have heard nothing from them.  I have now filed a complaint with the Texas Attorney General, and will follow up and file with the better business bureau and the FTC.  Ji 
 I was disappointed when I received this CD.  Although it is original, the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two. By your side, (my favorite) is good for about two minutes.  Then the beat gets off track, and starts to sound terrible.  If this was done on purpose, I cannot fathom why. I know this is "lo-fi", but a hint of bass wouldn't hurt at all.  As it stands, the CD sounds like an unfinished product, and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own. I think this CD would best be used for some sampling...especially in today's hip-hop.  If you are looking for beautiful, relaxing music...look elsewhere 
 I bought this hoping to wow my family with some 30 minute meals but this doesn't work great on my electric stove.  If you leave it up too high for longer than a minute on the grill side the griddle coating burns off and stinks up the place.  If you can't leave it up high you don't get good grill marks.  I end up putting on high for a few minutes and then back down.  Doesn't cook thick meat for chicken breast through well.  You are better off finishing them in a real pan in the oven.  The coating chips easily.  I am thinking of going with cast iron as it is more work in the begining but I think it worth it in the long run 
 Most of the tips offered in this book are basic. As a senior majoring in CS, there was little that I had not heard before. One strong point of the book, however, is how Gunderloy ties together all the loose ends of the development cycle. This book gives an excellent high-level overview of everything that should be happening throughout a development cycle, from project conception to release date and beyond.  The book is very heavily tied to VS .NET 2003; many chapters are little more than listings and explanation of VS add-ons and extensions, giving little value to anyone not using this particular IDE. 
 No product information at all.  Number of CD's?  Unknown.  Length of production?  Unknown.  Reader/performer?  Unknown.  ABRIDGED?  UN-ABRIDGED?  Not a clue.  If Amazon wishes to be a player in the audiobook sales game... it needs to stop ignoring customer requests for audiobook product details.  Until then, it's off to Borders Books for me!  -o 
 My name is Professor Yoshihiro Hoshi. After 18 years practice as a sexual therapist for me came a great moment. It all began in 1984 with the pop up on the world's market of Mantak Chia's "Taoist Secrets of Love: Cultivating Male Sexual Energy". This was his first quite good book which teaches how to circulate and cultivate your sexual energy for mental and spiritual development. A key point in it is to contract the so called PC muscle. This is necessary to guide the energy towards the spinal cord. This book has never been popular. However, in 1997 appeared a twist of this book namely "The Multi-Orgasmic Man". The difference between these two books is very small.   Barbara Keesling a philosophy doctor in Psychology followed suit in 1994 and published similar book: "How to make love all night". Once again at the spotlight is the PC muscle. She also insists that its contractions (the trivial start-stop technique) can give you multi-orgasms. Since 1984 and especially in the last 8 years these two books didn't have an alternative.  That's why neither I nor any of my colleagues said anything against them.   For my great happiness this was changed recently. It was Dr. Mitzumoto from Tokyo who was the first one to spot a major breakthrough in the Sexuality filed- the emerge of "Scientifically guaranteed male multi-orgasms and ultimate sex" by A. Ritz. I want on my own to support his support for this outstanding book and state that Mantak Chia and Barbara Keesling's techniques for (ab)using the PC muscle should be replaced by contractions of "The VIP Muscle".   It does NOT take months of exercising and strengthening it as in the case of Chia and Keesling's techniques. I will be surprised if anyone needs more than 15 seconds to find it and up to 3 days to prepare his body to get the maximum out of it. This "VIP muscle" is the REAL and ONLY possible orgasms generator in the male body! The PC muscle is used only to hold your urine and execute an ejaculation.    Hyper-activation of the PC muscle which occurs from "exercising" it leads to premature ejaculations as Ritz proves with thorough biochemical and anatomical evidences. The reason is its direct connection with the Sympathetic nervous system which manages the ejaculation process. On the contrary, The VIP Muscle is connected with the Parasympathetic nervous system which pacifies and nurtures the body. That's why the only muscle a man should use for multi-orgasms and ejaculation control is The VIP Muscle. Chia and Keesling's abusive techniques for the PC muscle can and should finally become history. 
 From a military viewpoint, this story is not even close to believable. From a liturature viewpoint, this book has simple sentence structure, simple character development, and very basic dialog.  This novel seams to  have been thought of and written on a weekend holiday.  Previous reviews  mentioned this book as a freshman level read and that is a good description  of the subject content 
 While the Littlest Pet Shop toys are cute, this electronic version is just a knock off of the Tamagotchi.  
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 This pan fails to deliver. This pan is the black sheep of the All Clad line. It is made of solid stainless steel and is not an aluminum triply pan as it is advertised. It is also made in Korea unlike the other All Clad products which are made in the USA. Shop around there are better products out there for half the price 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 This book is an excellent affirmation of Christian values that must be read by anyone who didn't realize that "The Da Vinci Code" was a work of fiction. Please reread that sentence; "The Da Vinci Code" is a work of fiction, like "Star Trek" or "Harry Potter". Unfortunately, the same people who fail to appreciate this fact are the same people who actually need to read "Cracking Da Vinci's Code," in order to restore balance to a worldview so easily upset by Dan Brown's clever yarn.   Unfortunately, this book is poor ammunition for anyone actually hopeing to defend the Christian faith from a popular fascination with the romanticized Cult of the Magdelene presented by Dan Brown. Doctors Garlow and Jones, both highly educated evangelists, have crafted a book that is more or less comfort food for their audience, not any scholarly attempt to address the factual underpinnings of Brown's novel. Somewhat pointedly, Garlow and Jones choose some of the weaker elements of Brown's novel to base their case on.  For instance, by way of dealing with non-Canon gospels (the Gnostic gospels, and the somewhat-less-offensive Apocryphal texts), Garlow and Jones give a selective history of the Council of Nicea which posits that they merely reaffirmed a version of the New Testament already in circulation. This is somewhat true, but ignores how the wording of the gospels were decided to specifically reaffirm the Nicean view of Christianity at the expense of other popular Churches of the time (including churches established by the very disciples of Jesus). They cast aspersions on non-Canon texts without actually addressing why they are or aren't considered reliable. Likewise, when it comes to a discussion of Paganism and its influence on Christian theology, the authors steadfastly refuse to acknowledge even the possiblity (much less the accepted fact) that rituals central to Christianity - such as baptism, the eucharist, and  chrism (annointing with oil or ashe) - were all employed by pagan cults for thousands of years prior to Christianity. Instead, Garlow and Jones rely on the emotional impact of the epithet "pagan" on their reader to cast aspersions and reinforcce doubt.   Most disappointing about this book is that the authors attack fiction with fiction. Where there exist stronger points in the scholarship that underpin Brown's fiction (and I can't emphasize enough that "The Da Vinci Code" is JUST an entertaining story), Garlow and Jones turn instead to a fictional couples experience attending a discussion group of Brown's book and it's central thesis, which naturally involve secularist ridicule of faithful Christians engaged in acts of ministry.   There are even a few instances where the authors manufacture assertions by inferral that were never made by Brown or any of his characters. Half way through this book, I got the distinct impression that neither Garlow or Jones (nor their editor) ever actually read Browns fictional works.  This is one of those rare books where I was relieved to finally have finished it. There is no vice in the spirited defense of ones faith through the presentation of facts in support of rational argument. Unfortunately, this book is very light on facts, and frequently resorts to emotional arguments. The Gospels tell us that Jesus himself debated with authority found in a thorough knowledge of the law, and was skilled in avoiding rhetorical traps. Garlow and Jones do the opposite: they count on the unfamiliarity and uncertainty of the general population, and frequently employ rhetorical traps. Anyone seeking to be Christ-like, and defend their faith, would do well to not rely on this book. 
 Talk about long winded!!!  I find this a difficult read, he goes from one subject to another leaving me saying "whaaaaaat??".  Maybre I'm just a moron, got up to page 75ish & chucked. I read for pleasure, why tourture myself??!!!  It's too bad because he has always facinated me... 
 I am not a right winger whatsoever, am against our involvement in the Mid East but did read this book. I can't say it better than Alan Dershowitz who commented about Chomsky's writing in general: many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 This book (The Return of anti-Semitism) is merely a catalog of the rise in modern anti-Semitism. It ultimately fails deeply and thoroughly by not even attempting to explain the reasons for anti-Semitism or the solutions to anti-Semitism. Indeed, the author even seems quite proud to brag about not knowing the reasons or solutions. It is as if he is so horror struck at the mere thought of anti-Semitism that he feels his only job is to point it out so that the whole world too can be equally horror struck with guilt. Being horror struck, however, is not a sensible or just policy.     It's true that in America we are still horror struck and guilty about anti-Semitism, largely as a result of our particular moral disgust at the German holocaust. Accordingly we always support the Israeli gov't, although nobody really knows where this policy came from or why we pursue it despite the world wide hatred toward us that it has engendered, and the direct connection to 9/11. We don't dare risk sounding anti-Semitic by suggesting  that if we had supported a just peace (internationally built and defended wall at internationally recognized borders) in the Middle East rather than blindly supported the Israeli occupation, 9/11 would probably not have happened. After all, the terrorist are over here because we're over there.       When Likud came to power in Israel they openly swore Israel would no longer be a "dwarf state" and that they were not occupying the West Bank but rather liberating Judea and Sumeria according to Biblical prophesy. Much of Israel does not support this blatantly imperialist, racist policy; yet America does out of a blind dumb fear of being or feeling anti-Semitic. You can admire us a little for being so sweet,  but how practical  is our sweetness and dumbness when directly and indirectly it caused 9/11 and makes us hated by much of the world? As long as we blindly give Israel the weapons to kill Muslims in the West Bank how can we blame Muslims for thinking of us as Western Crusaders or Zionist occupiers, and much of the rest of the world for hating us as Texas sized bullies?     The author completely ignores the core issues causing much of modern anti-Semitism and the possible solutions, because he prefers to manipulatively capitalize on the Holocaust guilt that has served Likud's deadly occupation of the Muslim West Bank so well. We can no longer blindly pretend, as this author does, that modern anti-semitism can exist separately from American's and Israel's 50 year war against the Muslim West Bank 
 She does have an interesting theory that every man is either a "seeing" "Feeling" or "hearing" man and depending on which they are is how you communicate with them. Since I have not applied her methods I am not going to say it doesn't work, but "Make up, Don't Break up" makes much more sense in understanding men & being able to get closer to them 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 I am certain that this is an invaluable book for those needing writing help. Yet, there is an extreme drawback to this book, for no matter how well written this book may be, the paperback version is produced with a mere 8 point font throughout-making the book seriously unreadable.    If you need the writing help I suggest you spring for the more expensive version of the book, or better yet just buy the latest edition of Punctuate it Right! by Harry Shaw. 
 Buy this book if you want to listen to this guy beating his chest about how he got wealthy by being a marketing guru and squirelling his income away like Ebenezer Scrooge. He boasts about how he still works part time for fun to generate money he doesn't need. But apparently he doesn't think about donating this money he doesn't need to charity let alone giving his precious time to charity.   The really funny thing is, at the end of the book, he tells the reader not to buy brands and designer clothes but buy things only of real value. I agree with him. But he has just rubbished the entire marketing industry that he lauds in the first part of the book as a great place to make a highly paid career. It apparently does not occur to him that there is a big contradiction between the sales and marketing people who get paid megabucks for pumping products up beyond their real value and the truly skilled workers who create "real value" and get paid jack all. What a total cynic and hypocrite ! 
 The author seemed to be on a soap box about the public education system and how we all need to boycot.  But I was able to stop cracking my knuckles using one of the methods 
 I do not know whether this was Suttons first book, but it reads like it is. The information would be far more effective arranged quite differently. Even the publisher did not correct either the authors style or his arrangement of the material.  Over all, I was disappointed. The style is sloppy, redundant at times and overly general when it needs to be specific. Linkages are may times vague and not born out by actual material, causation is then implied. A lot of the book is more "guilt by association" then guilt by actual evidence. This book could have been researched and written to be much more precise, clear and organized.   Many other books do a better job bringing out the hidden side of history. Unfortunately Sutton is not one of those books. For the price asked for it, I could not recommend him as a valuable source.   If a paper back version selling for $6.95 ever comes out, then and only then could I recommend spending any money on it 
 "The Most Anticipated Book in the History of Poker!" exclaims a blurb on the cover.  Well, if so, I can tell you that a lot of people have been, or are going to be, VERY disappointed.  Comparing the classic Super/System from 1978 with this book is, to paraphrase Mark Twain, like comparing lightning to the lightning bug.  This book is more of a tribute to Doyle Brunson than it is "A Course in Power Poker."  Johnny Chan writes a fairly vacuous Preface in which he lauds Brunson, but doesn't say anything about how to play.  Then we have Brunson's Introduction in which he tells us mostly about the contributors to the first Super/System.  Next there is an autobiographical sketch by Brunson entitled, "My Story."  (If you want a book that gives the real flavor of Brunson's "story," get a copy of According to Doyle (1984).  It contains 47 chapters in which Brunson recalls his early days and life on the road.)  Following "My Story" is a short history of Texas Hold'em by Crandell Addington which isn't much, and then there is the first chapter that could actually be considered part of a course in power poker.  This would be 43 tips from Mike Caro cribbed from his lectures and books.  However the tips are hardly "exclusive" for SuperSystem2 as claimed.  Beginning with Caro's cute but now very familiar, "In the beginning, everything was even money," most or all of the tips have been recycled.  For example, Tip #18, page 146, "WHEN A FREQUENT BETTOR CHECKS TO YOU...don't bluff" is just about the same as Tip #10 "Seldom bluff if frequent bluffers have checked into you" found on page 137 in Caro's Fundamental Secrets of Winning Poker (1996).  In fact Caro even recycles his "exclusive" tips in this very book.  Tip #31 says that PLAYERS STARING AWAY...are almost always more dangerous than players staring at you," while Tip #40 says in part that "OPPONENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BET OR RAISE IF THEY ARE: ...(3) staring away."  Jennifer Harman's chapter on limit hold'em is so ordinary that it's remedial.  There's not even a hint of anything new.  There are a number of books on the market that cover the same ground much more thoroughly.  I especially recommend Small Stakes Hold'em: Winning Big with Expert Play (2004) by Ed Miller, David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth or anything by Sklansky.  Also her insistence on referring to hands backwards, "6-7" (e.g., on p. 252) instead of "76" is annoying and contrary to a well-established convention.  And the caricatures by Russ Braun!  They are so bland and flattering that each may have passed prior inspection by the subject's mother.  Comparing these to the witty and sharp work by Stan Hunt in the original is like comparing a cliche to something alive and vital.  Brunson doesn't even look like himself.  Here he's just a generic, smiling, dough boy kind of guy--except in the small, clever, lifelike drawing gracing page 7 which WAS drawn by Stan Hunt, copied from the first book.  Good are the chapters on Omaha and Stud Eight-or-Better.  However, although Brunson has Bobby Baldwin billed as his author of the Omaha Eight-or-Better chapter, actually it was written (as acknowledged) by Mark Gregorich.  He does a good job of introducing the game and giving some of the strategies, and I'm sure he is a fine player, but what about Bobby Baldwin?  Well, as CEO of Mirage Corporation and President of the Bellagio Hotel and Casino, Bobby is far, far too busy to write the chapter himself.  So he just lent his name and his supervision.  Can you spell R-I-P-O-F-F?  Perhaps the most embarrassing part of the book is Doyle's chapter on no limit hold'em.  It is little more than a reprise of the same chapter in the first book published 28 years ago.  Also recycled is the section on "Colorful Names of Various Hold'em Hands" on pages 628 and 629.  The dated references to Raquel Welch ("38") and Broderick Crawford ("10-4") seem more than a little out of touch.  Indeed, this book is nostalgic tribute to Brunson and the great success he and the original book achieved.  And that is a shame, because this book is billed as an exciting event in the history of the publication of books on poker when in fact it is something hastily put together to flatter Brunson and, hopefully, the pocketbook of those involved.  One final thing: there is a Glossary, suitable for beginners, which is okay as it defines such things a "Deuce," "Flush," "Four of a Kind," etc., but seems a little basic for "A Course in Power Poker."  Worse though is this definition of a "Cold Deck": "A term often used to describe the deck by players who feel they're not getting enough playable or winning hands."  Players may indeed remark that "the deck is cold," but the origin of the term comes from the fact that a stacked deck used by cheaters that is switched into the game tends to be "cold" to the touch since it has not been handled since it was stacked.  Bottom line: pass 
 If anybody knows anything about music, you don't judge an artist on how many albums they sell or there image, you judge them on raw talent and the total package. Please anyone correct me if I'm wrong. When Mariah came out in the early 90's she was unstopable. She had a slew of hit singles, she wrote her own music she was on the top of her game. Then in the late 90's she fell off because she left pop music ( which made her famous) and she wanted to get in touch with her inner Snoop Dog and go more R&B and have a lot of rap artists on her CD's Snoop dog, Bonethugs in harmoney, P diddy on Honey remix and the lists goes on with Rainbow, Glitter, and Charmbraclet which didn't sell compared to her previous albums because she changed her formula.  She went with more midtempo songs that didn't require a lot of vocal range and high notes because when you have an album with a lot of ballads you have to perform these songs live on talk shows like the Rosie O'Donnell show, Mtv, and Ellen and that puts a lot of strain on your vocal cords and as you get older you can't hit them high notes any more and you don't want to embarrass your self on national tv. So she did a lot of breathy numbers and made her videos more sexier so you can focus on her body and everthing hanging out and not focus on her voice. Not to mention she had to fit in the teenie bop audience because Britney was selling cd's off the hook.  I believe that she loves Rap and R&B but she seen that she wasn't selling like she used too so she decided with this album she had no choice but to go back to the ballads that made her famous in the first place. She had major success with this album because she is singing again. But she cannot sing live anymore. She sounds amazing on CD only and cannot hit those notes live. I respect that she is where she is because of her talents but as of now she is nowhere the best female vocalist anymore.   She is so overated now. Mine again, and Circles she can't sing live are you crazy she won't be able to speak for a month if attempted. The best female vocalist right now is Christina Aguilera. Her voice is so Powerful and clear she blows me away all the time. When she sings live she's like a beast and attacks the song. she sings like she is living the song right there. If you don't believe me get the Stripped DVD and get ready to be blown away. I don't care how she dresses she can blow any one away LIVE. Real talent isn't studio processed. It's live. Anybody who can surpass there studio recordings LIVE is the real deal. Mariah was the best now it's Christina 
 I have never liked the character of Nefret.  I wish it had never been introduced to the Peabody series.  I hope the future books are better than this one 
 There are certainly a number of interesting story lines in this book but it is written in a breezy lightweight style and follows no discernable pattern or outline. Really this is a collection of short stories around a vague central theme of the efforts of "most" Frenchmen to protect their famous wine collections from the Germans. While certainly the stories from Alsace, Burgundy, Champagne and Bordeaux are decidedly different, there are many connected themes, such as the conflict between passive resistance and active collaboration, that remain unexplored. Further, the actual brutality at the doorsteps of many of these people is glossed over in favor of repeated stories about doctored wines with grand cru labels. This could have been a much better, richer book 
 For years Discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science. Now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless. Very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science. After buying Discover since it's very inception I find it sad what has happened to this magazine. Check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months 
 I got this for my son's 9th birthday. It looked like so much fun, but it is just a bunch of colored ping pong balls on top of a hair dryer. Lots of tiny pieces. They invented a lot of ridiculously complicated games to disguise the essential boringness. I almost returned it but couldn't face the repacking. No one plays with it, I'll probably pitch it into the trash in a few weeks 
 i don't know to whom this book the author wrote. If you are a beginner, you must be confuse read it but if you are not a beginner again u won't get nothing from this book.There is no tip or trick. Trade for a living far better than this boo 
 I have seen this movie a lot of times and this DVD is the only time that I did not hear the song sung by JEAN PITNEY. Maybe they forgot to add it when they made this DVD and it was very disapointing so that is why I only gave it 2 stars. Maybe you can look at this problem for me.A great movie                     thanks  Noel.                   
 I was so looking forward to receiving this desk. When we unpacked it we saw that the desk had been completely broken off on one corner and then REGLUED and shipped to me. Now no one will take responsibility and as Amazon has no live people at their customer service number they expect me to ship it back to them. I have NEVER been so furious over a purchase in my entire life 
 First Bill has never nor will he ever be a jazz musician. It seems that those who branch out and play multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary. Here's what chaps my hide the most. Bill has somehow captured the attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle launch. It burns me too no end when a person calls himself a "jazz" guitarist, but doesn't really have any chops. I know Bill has been called anti-technique, but what does that really mean? Would you want a heart transplant performed by a surgeon that means well, but really isn't very good at what he/she does? This guy is getting built up as something new and it seems every time I turn around someone that knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy in my face. I've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years and teaching for 8 years. When I have guys that actually debate me that Bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say Pat Martino, or that Bill could somehow hang in a jam session with someone like Pat Martino, I have to shake my head in disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when charlatans are giving more credit than someone like Pat who has been on the road for years and paid dues that Frisell couldn't imagine. Is Bill Frisell a Jazz musician, No! Maybe if the guy could woodshed for a dozen years he'd come up with something. For me I'll stick with the guys that really know how to play......Johnny Smith, Peter Leitch, Jim Hall, Pat Martino, Kenny Burrell, Billy Bauer, Tal Farlow, Lenny Breau, Jimmy Bruno, Jimmy Raney, Wes Montgomery and so on 
 if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book.  liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any "no" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him.  sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: "but what will they think of me?" and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a "morbid depression" and goes back to him.  repeat for 300 pages...   "careless," "self-indulgent," "filler" are three words i'd use to describe it 
 Unfortunately, Malphurs has again published a book that far underestimates his readers.  Advanced Strategic Planning does little more than lay out the basics of strategic planning; issues of greater consequence are left  untouched.  Dealing with entropy in an organization is a serious issue that  Malphurs seems to believe goes away if one's vision/goals/strategy are  rightly aligned.  I was disappointed with this book.  Better to wait for  Post-Advanced Strategic Planning 
 I don't have anything personal against this book.I have dabbled in faux finishes and wanted more ideas on how to do different  techniques and this book was too  technical for me. It was more to do with making your own glazes and customizing your paints and info on the many utensils etc. I needed something more basic.I just want to be able to go to the store buy my own premade glaze and paint colors and then do a finish 
 I don't even know where to begin.  This is just awful awful awful.  The music sucks, the material is desecrated.  Let's hear of this CD nevermore 
 ...I read a chapter of the book at a bookstore and my opinion is it is good if you want more practice questions to add to other resources you are already using. (I know it is kind of funny the way review question and answers are numbered 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 i am three quarters thru this book and no amount of money could make me finish it. what do people see in this writer? the dialogue is drivel, the characters implausible, and the situations unlikely, to say the least. so here somebody finds another gospel of the life of jesus. of course, this is accompanied by murder and skullduggery and an airhead opera singer (of all things!) heroine.  i'm sorry.  maybe if i were twelve, i'd think it was really cool 
 I remembered liking big audio dynamite, so I thought I'd check out their greatest hits cd.  I did not recognize a single song.  None of the songs I do like were included.  I am not sure what criteria they used to determine their greatest hits, but this collection of songs is really subpar.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 Educational advice from an unrepentant Weatherman/bomber of the '60s.  Not worth the trees destroyed to print it.  Avoid unless you are a rabid socialist 
 I am a stress management instructor looking for some new ideas. I teach quick-fix techniques for people to calm themselves during their busy lives, and so this book attracted me. This book however is a jokey book, with one line per two pages, so you can read the entire thing in 2 minutes. It gives you ideas to distract yourself for a minute from what ever is causing your stressful reactions, like make a paper airplane and send it across the room, or name as many teams you can in a sport. Childish ideas if you want to have a bit of a laugh, but if you are actually looking for something to deal with serious stress overload this is not the book for you 
 The overwhelming impression one gets when reading Pat Yale's contributions to this book are that here we have a woman who, due to her own ill-founded preconceptions, has almost completely failed to understand and appreciate the beauty of the culture into which she finds herself immersed. As a result, her comments regarding Iranian culture come across as being crude and disrespectful, often obnoxious, and even downright racist. Perhaps as a Westerner she cannot help being the way she is, but if that is the case, what on earth is she doing going to Iran in the first place, and what kind of an authority is she to write a travel guide?  For example, in the section on p.51 entitled "The Iranian Way of Life", we are forced, amongst other things, to put up with the unnecessary snide comment, "It's a rare husband... who would as much as carry a dirty dish to the sink, let alone do any housework" - now would this not just as aptly describe a typical British or American husband (perhaps even her own?), who would rather spend his evenings down the local pub with his mates - and who will later urinate on someone's wall on the way home, while singing loudly and hurling abuse at innocent passers-by? And then there are the ridiculous comments about rising divorce rates - which the author idiotically puts down to the existence of arranged marriages, failing completely to realise that the divorce rates in countries where arranged marriages are prevalent are MUCH lower than in the West where pre-marital sexual promiscuity is taken for granted. If she had half a brain, she would have reached exactly the opposite conclusion - that it is the gradual Westernisation of Iran that was leading to the increase in divorce rates (which is presumably one of the many reasons that they would rather do without the rapidly spreading disease of Westernisation - and if the satellite TV propaganda machine fails, there are always the bombs, eh?). And the section ends with the stereotypical and spitefully Islamophobic comment, "These days it's a rare man who can afford to take up his Islamic right to have four wives".  And she does rant on and on about the oppressive hijab that she has been forced to wear, and the segregation between men and women. Sadly for her, the author does not appreciate the beauty of a society in which modesty and piety are valued so greatly. Rather, the author (deducing that all Iranian men must be sexually repressed) expresses her surprise at not having been fondled! She did in passing mention the fact that she was treated with great dignity as a lone woman while queing for her visa extension, but apparently failed to see past her veil enough to realise that this elevated respect for women permeates the whole of Islamic culture. And she would do well to note that it is precisely this modesty  which makes arranged marriages work so well (in complete contradistinction to the misguided promiscuity and sexual freedom in the West, which effectively renders marriage meaningless and leads them to fail).  So the result is a book which is technically sound and reasonably comprehensive, interspersed with the most ourageous Islamophobic/Iranophobic Western hate propaganda - an irritating and unusual combination which leaves you wanting to kick [...] Perfect then, for your stereotypical FOX-News/CNN-educated American tourist, who probably should never have been let out of the country in the first place.  Until something better comes along (perhaps a new edition completely rewritten by someone who actually ENJOYS being in Iran and APPRECIATES its culture), then unfortunately this otherwise dubious piece of hate-literature remains a useful guide.  [If the spiteful comments get too much, simply striking through the offending paragraphs/pages with a thick black marker pen may help] 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 I read this book with an open heart and could not find one redeeming character in the group. The people who are involved in this story are not very nice people. I read it....and was glad when I was done. So very depressing 
 I bought my Epson Printer CX 4600 last yr. thrilled w/ it, (and the price) because I was using mostly color.  However the "thrill is gone" now.  My experience has been exactly the same as the other reviews, only I thought I had done something wrong when the brand new black ran out and after cleaning the nozzels the color was gone, and it didn't tell me which color I had to replace. If I hadn't seen these other reviews I may have taken it into my repair place and spent a bundle tyring to find out why....Too bad we can't send these "all in one" reviews to Epson.  Thanks very much for the forum. 
 Incredibly dull "hard SF" novel reads more like a soap opera set in the nail-bitingly-intense world of academia. Skip it 
 DBI gives a pleasant overlook of the branding process illustrated with various examples. It is however not a guidline to creating/building/maintaining a brand, so in this the title is misleading.  Warning: There are tons of compairable books around of equal or better quality. Only for those you don't have to fork out +/- $99,- to buy it second hand here!!! The book is not antique, the book not a life altering experience and the content is not worth more than $20,- second hand, so beware not to be tricked into paying quadruple the price it is really worth 
 I love history.  I love Biblical history. It seemed as if the illustrator had a "proverbial gun to their head" to get all the text into "X" amount of pages -- thereby printing it every "which way" in order to accomplish this feat. It wasn't "cute" nor CLEAVER having to read spirals -- in a book that has so much GOOD INFORMATION -- that NOVELTY need not be included!!!  Due to this need for attention -- my score for this book which had been a five star rating did a nose-dive down to one star.  I went to a librarian's meet, where this was a "must read" and in the discussion attended by 30+ librarians, they indicated the "same thought!"  (If there is ever a) next edition -- think twice! 
 I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend, but after reading this book I'm frankly not sure the friend read this book. I was really looking for a thoughtful answer to the question in the title, but I now suspect the title is a gimmick to sell more books in a post- September 11 world.   This book is actually based on three lecture series by the author, and at the end a quick chapter titled "Conclusion" does not reach a Conclusion and does not answer the title question.  My guess on What Went Wrong? Corrupt, self-serving leadership, more interested in enriching themselves rather than transparent decision-making. The Indonesians have a term for this, KKN, for Corruption, Collusion, and Nepotism.  I would give this zero stars if possible, but there are some interesting historical tidbits that might warrant 1 star. 
 Wild at Heart can captivate your interest and suck you in to believing it's all good.Problem with this book is that it is not sound when it comes to true untwisted scripture.I first loved this book and it began to change me until I researched further only to discover that The Bible has been used incorrectly.If you don't believe me,just punch in Wild at Heart on any search engine and read the complications with these writings.If you are a believer you will see in a very short time what I mean. If you're not a believer I suggest you purchase a Bible instead.With much love to all.......................... 
 We begin with a spark of consciousness, an instinctual  incentive to use our brain for survival. But before we've learned much of anything, we're already 'here'. Our consciousness isn't a result of  a required amount of computational power, its  there first. We know this intuitively, because we feel/know it first-hand  in ourselves, and make the fair assumption that other humans have this in common with us. (It's not that far of a leap in faith to assume a quality of self-awareness in animals, who have little if any discernable computational ability.) Somewhere along the line, some 'scientists'  forgot this, and theorized that when a machine got smart enough it would be more than a machine. This  has nothing to do with self-awareness any form we actually know it. Computers have been 'out-thinking' people in many ways for quite while, (mostly as a matter of simply being able to 'turn' to the correct 'page' of their theoretically unlimited 'memory' a billion times faster than we can), and yet they are still just machines. Getting them another billion times 'smarter' won't really change a thing, except, perhaps, for a more perfect illusion.  
 I found this book disgusting in more ways than one. Is Ms. Klum really targeting women who feel they need to re-vamp their bodies, images, sex lives, etc? In other words, the average, moderately insecure woman? Wow, it really makes me feel special to see PAGES AND PAGES--even the inside of the front and back sections--filled with images of an airbrushed, overworked Heidi Klum. How can anyone aspire to that virtually unreachable level (as if Ms. Klum is anyone special without her makeup artist and hair colorist)? Certainly not someone who is taking the time to read this book. If you're in the mood for getting your ego stomped on or for seeing Ms. Klum in a book riddled with soft porn, shovel up the eighteen bucks and ENJOY 
 I've seen a lot of movies and read a lot of reviews over the years, and I have never before found a movie that was judged so highly by well-known critics to be so poor. There is a fair amount of visual beauty, including that provided by lead actress Shu Qi. But the imagery amd music are repetitive, the camera work is slothful and uninspired, the music is largely trite and cloying, and the sparse dialogue is alternately trite and banal.  good love stories show you why and how the people love each other; these show you neither. I am a big fan of foreign films and I often like films that don't follow conventional formulas, and films paced slowly and without a lot of dialogue or action, e.g. The Silence and Cache. But without much dialogue, action, innovation, or substance, what's left is "Three Times".    
 This book was a gigantic disappointment.  The whole "male fairy godmother" thing just insulted my intelligence from the beginning.  What could have been an insightful book about real customer service impacts really "lost it on the dismount."  The examples of customer strategy seemed forced and stretched beyond plausibility.  The key character did not really seem to wrestle or grapple with many of the concepts.  A business fable should inspire action, and this book simply did nothing.  It wasn't a bad "read" per se.  There were some entertaining facets, but it you are really looking to wow your customers and turn your business around, this is not the book for you.  No matter how time-constrained you might be for a read on the topic, this will not be a good investment 
 It would not download; it just stopped about 1/4 the way through.  I will have to send it back 
 This is another Hollywood costume epic. They spared no expense with the set and costumes, hired talented big name actors Rex Harrison, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive.   Harrison was terrific as Gaius Julius Caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and Richard Burton does not come across as a great Mark Antony. His character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by Cleopatra, Antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked?    Although the film is titled Cleopatra, it focuses more on the historic events.  The film also reduces Cleopatra to the woman depicted in Octavian's propaganda rather than portraying the real multi-dimensional woman who was intelligent, a gifted political strategist, expert linguist, dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty.  They don't give you sense of what was so compelling about Cleopatra.   She is depicted as a combative shrew with both Caesar and Antony. I doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man. If you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here?  I would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as Roman military leaders and the weak position of Egypt compared to Rome.  Given the limitations of their vision of Cleopatra Liz Taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish, beautiful, seductive and glamorous temptress; she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance.   Although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you can't deny Taylor's appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material.  Although Taylor shines sadly we never get to know Cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed Hollywood costume drama.   This movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the 50's and sixties - the style reminds me of DeMille films like The Ten Commandments. It did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of Taylor and Burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit.    The research, writing and the Directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama.  The real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great. 
  	The author of A Northern Light is Jennifer Donnelly.  She resides in Brooklyn, N.Y, with her husband and daughter as well as two greyhounds.  Other works by  the author  include Humble Pie and The Tea Rose.  A Northern Light was the winner of The Carnegie Medal, The Los Angeles Times Prize and A Michael L. Printz Award Honor Book.   	The intended purpose of this book was to address many issues that young people face growing up.  The main character, Mattie Gokey, has to go through many hardships and make many adult decisions in this novel.  Mattie lives with her Pa and younger sisters.  Other characters that play a large role in this book are Weaver, Royal, Minnie, Miss Wilcox and Grace Brown.  A murder takes place in this book that was based upon real events.  Even though the murder was an actual event, the characters are made up to help it come clearer to readers.  Grace Brown's body is found in the lake after she takes a boat ride.   She gives Mattie a bundle of letters to burn but when she is found dead, instead of burning them, Mattie begins to read them and discovers many important aspects of the murder.  Donnelly skips back and forth from past to present and takes us through part of Mattie's life.  She also adds alot of advanced vocabulary for Mattie's words of the day.  She also uses language of the time period to make the story  come to life better.   	Although this novel received many awards of excellence and I'm sure alot of people would greatly enjoy  reading it, I was not one of them.  At the beginning, I thought it was going to be a very exciting murder mystery, but was disappointed to discover that the murder played only a small part in the whole novel.  I did find it very interesting though that it was actually based on a real murder.  I would probably not recommend this book for someone who is looking for a murder mystery because the murder only plays a small part in the novel.  Also, I think the author could have labeled the chapters a little more clearly because it got a little confusing with all the switching back and forth between past and present.   	I would say the intended audience would be young adults and most likely just females.  It contained some adult content, such as some profanity, as well as some sexual content.  Boys would probably not enjoy this novel because it is, in some aspects, a love story.  There's "sparking" and affairs and dirty older men at the hotel.  A younger person would not understand or want to read something that involves such material.   	In conclusion, A Northern Light was not one of my  favorite books that I've ever read.  The audience range is very  small and also based upon gender.  It is a well written novel, it just doesn't spark alot of interest in many people.  It went into to much detail at some parts and not enough for other parts.  I think she should have made the murder a more important part of the novel because it would have made it much more exciting.  
 When I first saw this album I thought "Heavy D....WITHOUT The Boyz?!  That can't be a good thing."  Here's the problem with this album: Heavy D took the "jiggy" route.  When I heard "Big Daddy" for the first time, I thought it was pretty tight and that it had that Heavy D feel to it.  So after hearing that, I went and copped the disc.  When I got home and read the liner notes, my jaw hit the floor.  There was Heavy D....smoking cigars, iced out, and playing the big willie role (the popular theme for the "jiggy" crowd in '97).  At that point, I realized that original MCs were quickly becoming extinct.  After years of success with his group, Heavy D had jumped the fence while simultaneously alienating his fan base all at the same time.  That might not have been such a bad thing had this album been at least somewhat decent.  There are about three tracks on the entire album that are even worth a listen.  There's a lot of lazy and predictable production (we're talking obscene amounts of beat jacking).  On "I'll Do Anything" Heavy D and Tony Dofat COMPLETELY jacked Hall & Oates for their tune "I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)" and it only gets worse throughout the album (I won't even get into how the Gap Band's "Yearnin' For Your Love" was abused on "Keep It Comin'").  There aren't enough good songs on this album to make Heavy's change of heart seem very believable.  Avoid this album y'all.  It's not completely terrible, but it comes dangerously close.  There are songs that border on wack and there are songs that are completely wack.  Sadly enough, this can be said for the majority of the songs on this album.  I was very disappointed in Heavy D and lost a little respect for him after hearing this.  I can only reccomend buying this if you can find it used for less than $3.00.  Otherwise, avoid at all costs.  Standout Tracks: Big Daddy (My Favorite) and "You Can Get It" feat. The Lost Boyz & Soul For Rea 
 I have come to eagerly await the publication of each Starfist book, so I couldn't wait to read this spin-off series.  Wow. I was so incredibly disappointed. The story plods, then bounces about and then rights itself only to plod again. Unlike the  standard Starfist series, there is no cohesion of plot, the characters are unlikeable and two-dimensional and (as mentioned elsewhere) I found myself rooting AGAINST the protagonists.   It was a genuine struggle to finish the book. I will not be reading anymore of this series and will desperately hope that the regular Starfist series maintains a higher level of quality 
 If you are new to Dead Can Dance, please do yourself a favor and don't buy this album, which is by far the worst album they have ever recorded. It shows DCD's lack of new ideas and reworking of tired ones. You should start with _Within the Realm Of A Dying Sun_ or _The Serpents Egg_ instead.  
 You can't sort out fact from fiction throughout the entire book because it is written in conversation form.  It's like three guys are siting in a room talking and one person says "Elvis was this", the next guy says, "no, he wasn't this, he was that", and the third guy says "I think you guys are both wrong, this is what I heard..." Don't waste your time or your money 
 I know that this was a memoir, but at one chapter, the title is definately misleading, and many of the goals and events received highly biased coverage.  Ms. Zia begins with a survey of history of how Asians were treated in America.  While I agree that the treatement was not ideal and certainly horrific by today's standards, there is absolutely no historical context here.  Unfortunately, Blacks were treated MUCH worse.  Catholics were vilified far before Asians were, and for much longer.  The way she presents things, you would only think that Asians were getting the short end of the stick.  She also harps on the lack of positive images of Asians in the media.  She self selects a small sampling, while there has been an increasingly large number of positive Asian role models in American culture.  Do the Italians whine when most Italian characters in media culture are mobsters?  She even imagines slights where they don't exist - for example, Sulu in Star Trek.  He was hard working to be sure (not that there is anything wrong with that), but as any fan of the series will tell you, he DID have a swashbuckling side to him.  If there is anyone who was emotionless and hard working, that would have been Spock, played by a white.  Besides, Sulu eventually made captain of the best vessel in the fleet.  So much for a negative image.  She gets into the issue of ethnic casting, focusing on Miss Saigon.  Well, it works both ways.  If only Asians can portray Asians, then Asians shouldn't portray whites either.  Too bad Lucy Liu.  Her character in Charlie's Angels was WHITE in the series, but was made half-Asian in the movies.  Opps, Lucy isn't even half Asian.  I would like to see Helen come over here to Asia to complain about the negative images of foreigners.  How many negative images of foreigners exist in Hong Kong and Japanese movies?  There was an advertising campaign here in Taiwan where a company had three white men in jail costumes after being arrested.  Foreigners are constantly portrayed by media outlets in several Asian countries in a negative light.  Why can't you get on your soapbox about that?  She comments on how many Asians are complemented on their English even if they have been in the U.S. their whole life.  Well, how many people who look white in Asia have been here their whole lives, but are still referred to as foreigners?  It works both ways Ms. Zia.   She also gets into her homosexuality.  What does THAT have to do with Asian American Dreams?  Like most Americans, those of Asian descent are opposed to homosexuality.    Finally, there is the notion of hyphenated Americanism (though she technically doesn't succomb to it because the omits the hyphen.)  She wants Asians to be treated as equals in America.  I have no problem with that.  I would like to see the same thing.  However, when you put your ethnic homeland BEFORE American in what you call yourself, how do you think you will ever be accepted as truly American 
 Okay, this book was so absolutely basic that I could have written it.  I was extremely disappointed with how much I didn't learn from this book.  It is 45 pages long, so if you're expecting a good, interesting weekend read--this is not it.  There weren't any detailed case studies.  There weren't any crime scene pictures.  Just basic info on fingerprinting and skull re-construction and a little bit of this-and-that.  Extremely basic.  Recommended for the interested 11 year old, but not for anyone who wants to really learn the nitty-gritty of Forensic Anthropology 
 Our book club so enjoyed Beginners Luck and I was looking forward to reading Last Call.  However, it was a disappointing book  The characters were poorly developed and the point of view was one of the reasons why. Was there one?   One never felt close to the characters or really cared what happened to them.  To me the only chapter well written was the last chapter where Joseph delivers to the readers, a 20 years later, epilogue.   There were a few funny incidents, but much of the dialogue was tired.  This book reads on about the 5th grade level   Sorry Laura, but I don't think you put much effort into this one.  Furthermore, the book was poorly edited.  Appeared choppy 
 As a cat lover, I've enjoyed the Cat Who... books immensely.  However, this book left me with a lot of questions, and there were several items mentioned that were never resolved.  Homer Tibbet had been a prominent character in many of that series of books, he dies, and that's the last mention of him.  Surely, James MacIntosh Qwilleran would have attended his funeral!  Same thing for Liz Hart.  She's killed in a car accident, and that's the last we hear of her.  What about the impact of her death on Derek Cuttlebrink,another prominent character in this series?  We've read all these books, these characters have become important to us, and suddenly we're left hanging in these relationships.  I'll continue to read the new books, but they're clearly not what they were even 3 or 4 years ago 
 I needed a new headset to use with Ventrillo, online voice chat for gaming, and I needed two requirements: 1. must go through the USB port because my mic port is broken, and 2. must be wireless because I constantly trip over the wire on my Logitech headset when making quick trips from the computer to the kitchen... which is why my Logitech headset broke in the first place.  This Microsoft headset fits both requirements, so I bought it. Unfortunately, the sound quality is HORRIBLE. It sounds like you are talking over the phone, like someone calling in to a radio show. It is NOT crystal-clear sound at all. My guild mates on Ventrillo laughed at me so much that I put this headset aside and slapped my Logitech headset together with masking tape 
 This book is just awful. There are such biased misrepresentations of Christians and the Bible that it would be viewed as bigoted if it were aimed at any other group of people. The Bible is misquoted, taken out of context and generally misapplied. Anyone who chooses to use this as a classroom adjunct should first be mandated to study what the Scriptures really has to say 
 The author has a decent touch with action sequences (few though they are in this book). And he seems to have a real affinity for martial arts which comes across in his writing and enriches his story. But he is very akward at moving the plot forward and constantly depends on groups of characters sitting around dicussion what happened. "Why did this clue appear earlier? What is the significance of this event? What trends should we see based on events so far." Very clumsy style which veers into Hardy Boys book territory. But when he finishes explaining everything that's happended so far he writes competently. If you got the book free and like the genre it's worth reading on a plane 
 I am a senior in college majoring in history and I just finished writing a paper about this book for a college class, and after reading the other reviews for it here I feel I should write my own really quick to present a different opinion.  It was a good book, and did give a good view into the lives of colonial women, but I'm wondering what anyone learned from it.  There was nothing surprising at all, completely mundane.  I do not feel there's a need to argue the importance of women in history, no one's writing any books about how great chairs are for sitting, it's understood.  Of course no society could develop and function without women and all of the very important things they do, to me thats a given.  Anyway, I wont go on any more but in my opinion the book just isn't groundbreaking or interresting on any level what so ever 
 While this biography of a fine, mysterious player is adequate, Casway's assertion that  19th Century baseball was an "Emerald Age," due to Irish dominance is ludicrous. Almost all the top ball players were of English ancestry at the time, which reflected the U.S. immigrant population. With the exclusion of Negroes, Latins etc. Irish did stand out as a "colorful" minority 
 This product is a box o' junk.  My son got this for Christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it.  The hat fell apart within three days (and he hardly played with it - just wore it on his head a few times) - the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat, which is obviously dangerous.  I contacted the company and they have not responded.  
 I really wasn't very happy with this garage. The ramp broke very quickly and it is hard to get the cars in and out of the elevator. It comes apart and is hard to move around. It was more expensive than the fisher price garage and not as durable 
 I would never have bought this movie for myself - I think the movie is lame.  I borrowed it from my nephew to see it and a friend "borrowed" and never returned it.  I just bought it because I owed my nephew the movie.  There were very few original funny moments in it 
 If I could give this book 0 stars I would. I think this portrays a horrible vision of how Jersey City was during that time period. I grew up in Jersey City during 80's early 90's. My parents spent all of their lives there. I am actually jealous when I hear about all of the fun they had during their childhood an in their 20's. They have the best stories and had the best times of their life in Jersey City. They developed close knit life long friendships with friends they met at an early age. My mother grew up in St. Al's parish and my father grew up in Our Lady of Victories parish. It did not give a true picture of Jersey City. She should have just harped on downtown which was trashy instead of bad mouthing the whole city. This is an embarassment to people who lived there to have others who are unfamilar with Jersey City read this garbage. I highly DO NOT recommend this 
 I kept trying to view it in context of the period.  It does takes one back to a time before computers and cell phones when detectives worked occasionally on bribes and intimidation, but also on instinct and legwork.  However, many of the conclusions reached by Lam are a bit hard to believe, and most of the characters are over the top.  However, it is a detective story in the classic sense, and a black-and-white movie fun read 
 Along with "Problem Child 2", "Look Who's Talking Too" is one of the worst sequels ever made. In a series of films, it's usually the second movie that is the worst. This one tops the original film in terms of bathroom humor and bad acting. These two ingredients are EVERYWHERE in this film! Both Kirstey Alley and John Travolta are terrible in their fighting scenes. Add in two of the most obnoxious comedians on the planet [Roseanne Barr and Gilbert Gottfried] to the mix, and you have got one big stinker of a movie 
 I'm embarassed that I read this all the way through. The language/expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff. I don't live with people who talk like that, and I don't understand the purpose: "sophistication"? To my mind, the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with @%#&*s.  
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 Talk about self-absorbed...I guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business...I thought the man made some good points, but few are helpful to anyone in the real world (or outside  the newspaper business).  Nausea sets in after the second chapter.   Neuharth will die an old, lonely, rich man.  Respected by many, hated by  nearly all.  Luckily, I didn't have to sit through this entire book.  I put  it down quickly 
 I bought this set because I was jonesing to watch some baseball history before the season started, and boy am I sorry I bought this.  The narrator is bad, the soundtrack is cheesy and repetitive, and most of the biographical information is presented in a way that keeps it from being interesting.    Even at six times the price I recommend buying Ken Burns' "Baseball" documentary, by far the best thing I've ever seen about baseball.  But if an 18 hour documentary is too much for you to watch, then I would recommend the "When it was a Game" series.  Anything but "Baseball's greatest Legends - Diamond Memories".  This set is so bad that I was only able to get about 2/3 of the way through the first disc and I haven't even bothered looking at the other two discs that came with it.  Please, save yourselves the money and most importantly the time.  Do not buy this 
 I had this vacuum for about a month.  The suction was so bad that after EVERY room I had to empty what little dirt was in the canister just to get back some suction.  I hated it!  Not only that but the bagless was a pain!  I had to go outside everytime to empty the dang thing because it was so messy!  Not to mention that trying to get the canister out and back in was the hardest thing ever.  It made even more of a mess trying to get it out and in!  I did not want that in my house!  I absolutely hated this vacuum 
 This version is worst than their "In Blue" cd. Gosh, why can't people just be and stay true to themselves? This is the Corrs's first attempt to be "Americans" and that says it all. If you really want to hear them at their best, buy their first cd and their "live" cd, where their Irish culture and heritage shines through. But if you want to hear "non-Americans" try to be "Americans" and then fail, by all means this cd is for you 
 The description of this dvd led me to expect a movie like "Musa" or "Warriors of Heaven and Earth"--I'd have even been happy with a movie comparable to "Crouching Tiger"--this movie isn't up to the standards of any of these movies though.  More of a farce than anything close to an "adventure"-the scenery is wasted with a lame plot that drags on and makes the movie seem about twice as long as it really is.  Perhaps if my own expectations had been lower--I wouldn't be so harsh on this movie--but compared to "Musa" or "Warriors of Heaven and Earth"--it's defintely sub standard. Different strokes--as they say--perhaps you'll enjoy this movie--I didn't! 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. The author seems more interested in self promotion and only scrathes the surface of the subject matter. In my opinion not worth the money. 
 I gave this book 2 stars, because it has some good points, mostly really bad points.  The good: You will be able to make basic 2D sprite games in Windows using this book and the source code on the CD. It encourages you to learn basic techniques involved with the other aspects of game development (sound, music, etc). The book comes with several games that you can run right off the CD.  The bad: This book doesn't really teach you much. In other Sam's Teach Yourself books, you learn each step of what you are doing, and you can put in the source code yourself. In this one, you merely read about PIECES of the source code, and are expected to run it off the disk. So basically, you are paying for a game engine, a bunch of source code examples, and a tutorial on using the game engine.   I would have enjoyed this book much more if it had spent time explaining exactly what the engine does and how to make it do it, not to mention how the code in your program interacts with the engine. It seems to me that this book is mostly for people who want to "cheat" and copy and paste the code to make their games, rather than understanding what they are doing and writing the code themselves. Since I was someone who wanted the latter, I was sorely disappointed. 
 The book has two main problems.  The first is Goldstein's explication of the incompleteness theorem.  The theorem is the reason for reading a book about Goedel.  For the most part, the worth of a book about him for a general reader is measured by the clarity of an explication of the theorem.  Goldstein's audience comprises readers who are not logicians or mathematicians, and so a lack of rigor is expected (p. 172).  But Goldstein simplifies too much.  Her explication is somewhat less clear than both the longer explication in Goedel's Proof by Nagel and Newman and the more technical introduction by Braithwaite in the Dover Publications reprint of Goedel's original paper.  Goldstein's numbering system (p. 172-175) is an example of oversimplification.  Goedel's numbering system "used the exponential products of prime numbers and relied on the prime factorization theorem which states that every number can be uniquely factored into the products of primes"  (p. 172).  In this way, the "metasyntactic relation of provability will become an arithmetical relationship" (p. 176).  Under Goldstein's simplified system of numbering, however, it is not at all clear that provability relationships among propositions would translate into arithmetical relationships among numbers, as they do under Goedel's numbering system.  Why does Goldstein offer an alternative numbering system for illustrative purposes?  I can't tell.  She says that her system, if it were made rigorous, would be just as complicated as Goedel's own system (p. 172).  So rather than invent her own, why doesn't she just set out a non-rigorous version of Goedel's own system?  (That is what Nagel and Newman do.)  Not only does Goldstein not improve matters, but also she loses clarity.  In her illustration, for example, she says:  "Suppose that GN(wffsub1) = 195589 and GN(wffsub2) = 317" (p. 175).  But under Goldstein's own numbering system, 195589 and 317 would correspond, respectively, to ~'00)' and x~(, neither of which is a wff!  By oversimplifying, Goldstein has made a mess.  The second main problem with the book is Goldstein's fascination with Wittgenstein and her comparison of him with Goedel.   Any comparison between the two thinkers feels strained to begin with, and Goldstein's book does nothing to allay that feeling.  It is a bit like writing a book about Vladimir Horowitz and then devoting a third of the book to comparing him with Liberace.   Moreover, apart from whether any comparison is useful, Goldstein refuses to take Goedel at his word when he says that Wittgenstein had no influence on his work (p. 115-116).  In fact, Goldstein takes Goedel's emphatic denial, coupled with what she sees as Goedel's resentment of Wittgenstein (p. 89), as evidence that Wittgenstein must have had an influence on Goedel, or "incentive" or "significant, if ambiguous, role," as Goldstein puts it (pp. 89, 116).  This is just weird.  If Goedel had written that he hated rock candy and didn't even like the looks of it, would Goldstein conclude either that Goedel really did like rock candy or that he ate filet mignon as a substitute?  The ink that she spills on Wittgenstein could have been put to better use on Turing or von Neumann, both of whom get too few words.   The book contains strange repetitions.  For example, twice Goedel's work is compared to Alice in Wonderland (p. 170, 252) and twice Goldstein tells us that her New York apartment has only one bathroom (p. 140, 184).  Her catty remarks about Goedel's wife, his diet, and their home decorating are rude and irrelevant (pp. 208-209, 223).  How poorly Goedel dealt with faculty politics is dull and irrelevant (pp. 234-245).  Some extra proofreading wouldn't have hurt, either:  "GN(p)" should be "GN(psub1)" (p. 174); "tilda" should be "tilde" (p. 174); "swiped" should be "swapped" (p. 210); and Waismann's name is misspelled twice (p. 105).  The book has its good points.  The stories of Goedel's quirks and his friendship with Einstein are entertaining, the sketch of the Vienna Circle is okay, and Goldstein is right to point out that Einstein and Goedel should not be lumped together with Bohr, Heisenberg, and others as "destroyers of objectivity" (pp. 38-39).  But that's about as good as the book gets.   
 Abandoning the reinterpretation of the initial epoch of Batman, like the previous writings of THE LONG HALLOWEEN and DARK VICTORY, HUSH instead is a tale set in the modern era. The plot concerns the arrival of a new villain and the supposed control of the insane criminal base of Gotham City. The Dark Knight must work to end the transgression that seems to be rapidly spiralling out of control.   The story begins as a simple kidnap and ransom story, that appears to be only a fraction of a greater crisis playing out behind the scenes, eventually turning into a mass profusion of ideas and set pieces without proper relevance or connection. The denouement is inauthentic, where it's fragmented and composed of distracting slack subplots largely unnecessary to the thematic undercurrent. Rather than follow through on the normal writing design of problem - reaction - resolution, the plot advancement has Batman continually reacting. A villain is introduced, generating the requisite fight scene that unfolds over an entire issue. This technique carries on until all the A list villains appear. It keeps the readers' mind disengaged from the "mystery" with its barrage of moments that provoke the certain, predictable appeal from the readership. HUSH ultimately becomes out of control throughout the plot development in its intent on being an epic, all defining book with its features of shocking moments and revelations. That trick has an overall numbing experience as the writing never recovers from the numerous blows to its credibility from the revisionist writing method.  The obvious mystery at the core is a simple pretext to affix a lingering, indulgent plot to the city's criminal element, ensuring that numerous revered characters are on display, the narrative never addresses or justifies the illogical, unexplained behavior of the characters. Rather than constructing a contemplative mystery worthy of Batman's abilities, the character is rewritten without the strong awareness and detective instinct, his character arc severely undermined as a result.  Overall, Hush never feels like a sincere attempt at storytelling. Where it differs from Halloween and Victory timewise, the revisionism and borrowed themes that characterized past writings are conspicuously promoted throughout the work with the same undisciplined methods. The book labors beneath redundancy and re-examination of ideas and passages already demonstrated, following the similar formula of those aforementioned works. It lacks inner consistency of the recent treatment of the world, and it fails to reconfigure its limited concept to place well within the current framework of the character. It doesn't attempt to explore the limits of the medium, but one entirely content to reside within its past conventions. Barely acceptable as an entertaining diversion 
 Let me sum up this 350-page rant in a few sentences.  1. There's a lot of crappy movies, television, and music getting made. (He's right about this. I actually agree with most of his opinions about specific films, shows, records, etc.) 2. Because of this, our jobs, our lives, our very civilization is in dire peril! 3. Therefore, we must put an end to all this making of bad movies, tv shows, and music! Michael, I really do like your reviews. But grow up for heaven's sake! It's just entertainment 
 As a young, beginning investor, I have been educating myself about investments, savings, etc.  With that in mind, I have been avariciously reading almost all the investment books I can find.  Edelman's book first brought to my mind a concern about index funds, because every other academic book I've read supports them.  I think Edelman has an axe to grind, being an personal finance manager and simply put, to Edelman, Index funds are the anti-christ and must be eliminated.  However, his logic does not make sense, nor do his facts and figures hold up.  The index funds simply mirror the market, and this they have done very well.  He neglects to go into their low fees, and also he does not address the issue of survivorship of mutual funds, that is, that the current data that is published includes only those funds that survive so they are naturally better.  Poor funds are simply eliminated or absorbed into other funds.  His comments on mortgages I found interesting, but consider that if you are getting a 10% return on an investment versus an 8% mortgage, that might make sense, but to get %10 you are going to have to invest in something risky (stocks).  Can we reasonably assume that 10% is a good reasonable return?  I don't think so.  So in sum, the work is biased toward moving money to professional managers while at the same time providing us with statements that are not well thought out.  Better books I'd recommend are Malkiel's 'A Random Walk Down Wall Street' and Bernstein's 'The Four Pillars of Investing. 
 This collection of fairy tales proports to support the feminist ideal.  This goal might be accomplished, but in the process, what were intended as cautionary and moral fables get turned into boring, monotonous drivel extolling the virtues of strong females.  Understand that I am a feminist.  I belive in equality, and am going into a still male dominated profession.  However, I found this book of fairytales to be uterly wooden, and repititious in their extolling of how strong and wonderful and save the day women can be.  In the process, our heroines lose all of the emotional growth they achive in the originals, and are reduced to a female carbon copy hero 
 returned item for refund; found it cheaper at Toys R U 
 I agree with another reviewer: this CD isn't worth writing home about.  Anthony has a good voice and with the exception of Charlene and Where I come from, the other songs fade into boring Muzik for me.  I've tried several times to get into this Cd, each time, it becomes nothing more that white noise 
 This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed 
 my friends and i just chose this for our monthly fashion-oriented book club (we've previously enjoyed easily appropriate selections like "the devil wears prada", etc.) and were unanimously disapointed (they all are about to write their own reviews here, though).  maybe this could be good for someone who isn't already a Kate fan, or has never heard such things about models doing drugs or being too skinny - like people who live in a bio-sphere or something.  i guess i just expected more indepth info - like, how about a FREAKIN' INTERVIEW WITH KATE HERSELF! - from an author who ran "the web's most popular Kate Moss site" for like 5 years.  some "fan" 
 Doris, why did you star in this movie? It is obvious the script was no motivation. Workers are sabotaging the plant because they want a seven-cent raise! Were you in need of movie residuals that badly?   Watching this movie is both painful and embarassing. If anyone in their right mind walks in while you are viewing it, they are bound to ask: "WHAT in the world are you watching?" I could only imagine what it must be like to have a fantastic career tarnished by STARING in it. I just could not take it in one sitting. Shock and disbelief prompted me to repeat my transgression by viewing in small doses. It took three attempts during a week of persistence and hot coffee to endure the relentless silly-lyric song-and-dance routines. Every other word triggers synchronized bellowing with cartwheels and soft-shoe taps in this romantic-comedy musical. For its time, some of the choreography may be good but there is so much of it (23), the story, which is weak to begin with, is buried. On average, there is two minutes of acting between each song.  Fortunately, Doris Day was prolific enough that THE PAJAMA GAME does not mar her good reputation. The redeeming value of the movie is her flattering haircut. TEACHER'S PET, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, SEND ME NO FLOWERS (bad-hair Day), and LOVER COME BACK are all delightful. This is precisely the reason I was so shocked with THE PAJAMA GAME. If you want to see a good musical, watch SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, WEST SIDE STORY or close your eyes and pick another Day film; you could not do worse.   I expect most of my films to be four or more stars because I read and trust the reviews of others before purchasing. This was one case where I was totally fooled. Even with Bob Fosse and Carol Haney, there is no way I can conceivably recommend this film with more than two stars. Despite the anticipated negative votes from devoted Day fans, I may hopefully save others from bitter disenchantment 
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 On his debut, Mims sets out to bring NY back (his words, not mine). I don't think this is the kind of album that's going to bring about any kind of ressurgence. Especially since he sounds like/bites Shawn Carter so hard. When he isn't biting, his flow on songs like "Like This", "Superman" (which rehashes the the same beat as his lead single), and "It's Alright" is pretty much nonexistant. And on joints like "Girlfriends Fav MC " and "Cop It" he bites Jay Z so hard (ad libs and all) that they start out sounding like Jay Z tracks. I won't even start on the lame similies. That would require more paragraphs than I normally allot myself.  There are a few songs that are worth a spin or two. In my opinion, "This Is Why I'm Hot" and it's remix are easily the standouts. Then there are joints like "Where I Belong" and "Doctor Doctor" where Mims switches up the topic and produces some solid material (even though they can come off kind of forced). "Just LIke That" is cool because of nice production (despite a godawful hook) and "They Don't Wanna Play" is okay -- it features a decent guest shot from Bad Seed (Bun B. drops a verse too). The only other time I've ever heard Bad Seed was on Apathy's Eastern Philosophy LP (dope album -- go get it), but don't expect him to come like he did on Ap's album. The intro is interesting because the production is nice and Mims speeds up the flow. The production as a whole ranges from good to decent. Nothing out of this world though.  Music Is My Savior isn't necessarily required listening, but there are worse releases to be put out there in the young year. If you're into beats and don't really listen to the person rapping, you'll love this. If you're into lyrics, I recommend passing on this one. Simply put: there are way too many wack lyrics and lame similies for me to justify buying this brand new. It's cats like this that water the rap game down and cause sales to take a sudden nosedive.  I recommend downloading it and testing it out before you actually pay for it.  Standout Tracks: Doctor Doctor, This Is Why I'm Hot [Remix] feat. Cham & Junior Reid (My Favorite), Where I Belong, Intro, They Don't Wanna Play feat. Bun B & Bad Seed, and This Is Why I'm Hot 
 This is surely one of the nastiest little films ever made.  It is a waste of a handsome young actor, John Shepherd, who plays a very troubled and closeted construction worker, David.  He is secretly in love with his best friend, Theo, and his covert problems multiply when Theo moves in with a girlfriend.  David can't handle the competition for Theo's affection, and goes overboard in trying to undermine their relationship.  He decides to come out to his parents, and tell Theo of his love, on a national TV-show!  This unfortunate plan, needless to say, backfires.  David's ghastly father pronounces him sick and summarily kicks him out of the house.  His now ex-friend Theo is angry at being manipulated, and shows David just how much so by beating him with a lead pipe!  It turns out that he and his girlfriend were a perfect match afterall:  they are equally unpleasant.  They walk off into the sunset together, but not before they look back at poor, bleeding David with a mixture of pity and loathing.  The perfect ending for a mean-spirited film that TLA should be ashamed to have produced 
 Initially thought the idea of the book funny, but in the end I was disappointed. I think this is because the book has no real story to tell, just lots of instructions on how to survive certain (very unusual) situations and drawings to go with it. The best part is the introduction where the author tells of how he survived Mt. Kilimanjaro - now that's a story! The rest is just a bit dull and rather a lot of common sense and mediocre ideas 
 It seems to me like Levinson barely put any effort into this book at all. There really is nothing new or groundbreaking in this book. To me, this was just a quick way for him to capitalize on his "Guerrilla Brand Name" to make an extra buck with recycled information.  The concepts in this book were so basic, they were almost insulting. Maybe if you are 14 years old and have no prior entrepreneurial experience this is the book for you. I felt ripped off. I actually ended up throwing it away... Catchy title, but it does not deliver at all 
 if you want to spend your time trying to figure out a poor guitar players ideas of wedding music transcriptions here is the book for you. The author puts Bach's "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desire" in A major, which would be alright if it made the piece fit the guitar, which it doesn't, and while he's at it he gives you a piece "Prelude #1, Op.3" written by himself, as a wedding standard?!! Spend your money on Jerry Snyders book "Weddings for Guitar" and you'll be much happier... trust me 
 Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with "S". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.  I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.  I would vote pass on this one. 
 For any of you teachers out there who plan to watch this in your classroom with your students:  BEWARE!!  First of all, I've heard of taking "liberties" with a book but this is ridiculous! Sex between Farmer Jones and the neighbor farmer's wife is not in the book, but sure is shown in the movie.  I was shocked to see them rolling under the sheet as the headboard was "knocking against the wall". Utterly revolting and embarassing for me and my students.  I expect better from Hallmark Entertainment, Family Home Entertainment, etc... Second, there is a "no rating" statement on the DVD - I'm angry about this and don't appreciate being taken advantage of. There was no warning about adult situations. It's a shame that one can't be truthful in advertising.  Buyer Beware 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series.  This is the most boring one of them all in my opinion, and, well, how many times can the same story be told?  Bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children, children figure it out, but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything, even when it's pointed out to them.  6,000 times.   
 I never received this product!!! I returned the black cloth bag I received instead of the glasses and I received an e-mail confirmation of my return of what I had received.  I have never received a refund!! 
 I previously wrote a somewhat obnoxious review of House of Leaves, but after some thought, have decided to edit it.    House of Leaves was mentioned to me by several friends and acquaintances, and hyped as one of the most frightening books they had ever read.  One individual told me it kept them up at night out of terror.  Others had said that they finished the book in a weekend and couldn't put it down.  Now, I love a good horror story, and several people promised me that this was THE horror story to read. After suffering through long boring academic-style descriptions of a house whose insides by far do not match its outsides, and footnotes written by a skeevy tattoo artist, I failed to find the scary.  I looked and looked, but it just wasn't there.    Thus, I'm disappointed.   It isn't so much that I minded slogging through faux academic literature (although that in itself is annoying - how many articles and interviews could possibly have existed on such an underground video project?!), but that I slogged through it looking for something that - for me, at least - just wasn't there.  So, if you want my opinion, the book isn't scary, and it's rather long and dry.  Even the supposedly frightening experiences of Johnny Truant, the tattoo artist, were kind of boring and made my eyes glaze over.  Hence my previous title of "A handful of Ritalin and a pot of coffee couldn't make this readable...".    Do I really need to be brought back to the days of writing research papers for college courses I only took to satisfy some ridiculous requirement?  That's what it felt like 
 The Quaran is very complex, and is interpreted wrongly more times than not. If one is not an EXPERT on the quarun, the TRUE meaning of the quaran in arabic AND THE REAL FACTS ABOUT PROPHET MOHAMMED'S (peace be apon him) LIFE AND CHARACTER, then one should shut their ignorant mouths (no offence).This book sugests that Mohemmed (peace be apon him) was evil! Is this the same Mohemmed who condemed his followers for burning down a church and rebuilt it? I do not pretent to be an expert, but i also know that the author of this book and those that have written +ive reviews certainly are not. Ignorance like this is what is the cause of evil in the world and the cause of any muslims, christians, jews or any other human commiting unjust attrocities. Surely the sheer stupidity of this book is immediatly highlighted in its summery! To critize islam, the quarun and Mohammed (peace be apon him)using those 'muslims' past and present who have wrongly interpreted it (as this book does) or used it as a tool for power and commited atrocious crimes, as evidence is ridiculous. Humans from all faiths and races have done equally bads things. How stupid would it be to hold the holacaust agaist all germans forever. This book is up there with Hitlers 'Mein Kamph'!  
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 Highly concentrated chemical smell, definitely gets rid of odors but DOES NOT smell like a new car 
 this book just didn't have any information in it that I didn't already have 
 The "original" versions are 4x3 letterboxed...  For anyone with an HDTV or widescreen regular TV, these DVDs are a major disappointment.  The original versions are matted from their original 2.35:1 aspect ration for 4x3 TVs, so they look like crud on an HDTV or other widescreen TV.  They appear to be made from the same transfers used for the laserdiscs.  The other versions, from 2004, appear to be identical to the DVDs previously released 
 Why would Amazon want me to review an order that they didn't fill?  I would LOVE to review this item - how can I get it???? I've been waiting since December for it, and was told last week, the back order will not be filled 
  Do dogs understand language?  Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies...  The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I'll say, "What do we do on an elevator?" and they'll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, "Look!  They understand every word you say!"    Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying "What do we do on an elevator?-we sit."  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from "What do we do on an elevator?" to "Sit" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.    Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog "understands" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.   Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.    Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be.  It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple.    Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth.    Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.    I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, "Do you love me?" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.  It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.    If I could I'd give this book no stars at all 
 I had one that was great for a couple of months, then started blinking "E" and some error number. Got it replaced. Now after a couple more months, the replacement started blinking "E" and "3" (the E3 error that others have reported). Will return it again. What a piece of junk, and for such a high price 
 "The Third Millennium" can only be described as a monumental event in the annals of crud.  On a literary level, this puppy manages to be even worse than the Left Behind books.  As "Left Behind" was one of the most purely awful bricks ever foisted on the book-buying public, that's no mean feat, but undeniably Paul Meier has accomplished it.  All I can say is that "The Third Millennium" is the worst children's book I've ever read.  I label it a children's book precisely because it's written for children.  Characters are cardboard, personalities are told rather than shown, and nearly identical sentences are repeated over and over.  Reading Meier is like reading stories by fifth graders; he knows the rules of the English language but can't grasp how to write effective sentences:  "Even though he congratulated himself on being an avant-garde psychiatrist, Larry couldn't supress a conservatism that more than occasionally popped out.  His religious Jewsih ancestors had made their indelible mark, which was reflected in the white trim on his gray house.  Knowing that he could close the shutters anytime he liked similarly comforted him."  (How many times did you have to read that final sentence before you understood it?)  "The Third Millennium" follows the standard formula of Christian potboilers.  A middle class family is minding its own business when suddenly neighbors get raptured, Israel is attacked for no reason, and the United States renames itself "the New Roman Empire".  The President does suspiciously anti-Christian things, such as defending the right to privacy and balancing the federal budget.  He also announces a plan to implant credit card numbers in everyone's right hand, and invites people to share their comments by dialing 1-800-666-6666.  (No, I'm not making this stuff up.)  Of course there are long chapters of folks reading the Bible and no shortage of instantaneous conversion scenes worthy of Chick tracts.  For the most part, however, the main characters do nothing but sit around watching TV until almost the end of the book.  Continuity also slips.  Leading man Larry Feinberg is first described as a psychiatrist but later as a physician.  His son Ben starts out as a medical student but later we're told that he's a math major.  Ben's girlfriend Cindy is supposedly blind, but that doesn't stop her from seeing a hippy-like classmate who turns out to be an angel.  Of course complaints like these miss the point, as even fans of "The Third Millennium" admit that the writing is pretty nasty.  The appeal lies in the supposed fact that this stuff is all biblically kosher and will be coming true any minute now.  In fact Meier tacks on an Acknowledgment section where he congratulates himself for his "compulsive quest for accuracy and feasibility".  Hmmm, let's see here.  Meier has Jews performing animal sacrifices in Jerusalem, apparently unaware that even the Orthodox halted ritual sacrifice centuries ago.  He mentions "the ancient Muslim Empire of Babylon"; Babylon came and went thousands of years before the founding of Islam.  One character claims that Hitler started the extermination of the Jews on 1942 on Av 9 (Av is a month in the Jewish calendar).  Unfortunately for him, the Holocaust actually started years earlier, in 1939.  Then there's the prophecies.  Practically half the book is devoted to having a dude named Jimmy lecture us on how many biblical prophecies have come true.  (The fact that Jimmy is a used car salesman, a profession not known for honesty, makes this unintentionally apt.)  Debunking every claim in the book would frankly tax my patience and exceed amazon's 1,000 word limit, but I'll give a small sample.  Consider this from page 79:  "Turn to Ezekiel 4:4-6 and note what God had the prophet do.  He lay on his side for 430 days to signify that Israel would be in another exile for 430 years. ... Because of their lack of repentance, their punishment was multiplied sevenfold, as Moses had warned it would be in the Torah in Leviticus 26.  Sounds strange until you add it to 536 B.C.  I'm going to translate this into the modern calendar.  Anybody recognize the significance of this date?  May 14, 1948, the date modern Israel was founded."  Let's see here.  The number of years between 536 B.C. and 1948 A.D. is 536+1948=2484.  On the other hand, a 430 year punishment multiplied by seven is 7*430=2910.  Now I think 2484 is not the same number as 2910, unless conservatives have decided to replace math with 'intelligent arithmetic'.  I would submit that most of Meier's other claims fall apart in a similar manner.  To give credit where credit is due, Meier's predictions are not totally off the mark.  Describing the President of the United States, he says the following: "There were no restraints on his pursuit of his own ends."  If that doesn't perfectly capture the attitude of our current chief executive, I don't know what does.  Other than that, however, Meier's attempt to fortell the future seems to have hit a bum steer.  How it is that garbage like this hogs the spotlight while great Christian authors such as R. A. Lafferty and Gene Wolfe languish in obscurity, I don't know 
 I could not really enjoy the film. I purchased it recently on VHS and the audio quality was horrendous. I don't think anything was ever done to remaster the audio, and it is very annoying to follow. Don't waste $19.95 on it. Watch it on TCM; even there the audio is distorted. I only got it because it is a very early Irene Dunne movie, and I was curious to watch it 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel.  I give it 3 stars for holding my attention.  A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past.  The one star is a mistake and I cannot seem to change it.   3 ***  stars 
 I bought this gloves so I wouldn't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime I went for a bag workout. One reviewer is clearly confused. They said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand. Turns out there is no metal bar in it, but instead it was plastic or something similar. Then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag I wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles. This has never happened to me before and I have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years. Yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years. Another thing I noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags. They get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them. Gave these gloves 2 stars since I liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work. But they need to be greatly improved upon. 
 Boring and irritating. Not one character is likable, and not one character is 3D 
 I have a kitten I can't keep up with and thought this would be a great idea. Wrong, he figured it out and lost interest in the first day. He will play with it for a few minutes but then looks to see where the beam is coming from, figures it out and walks away. A whole 2 minutes of fun 
 I am just wondering why isn't there a 0 star rating. This book is really insulting to anyone who has any business knowledge and common sense. Yes, we all know that customer service is important, and that we have to make everything possible to satisfy the customer AS LONG AS WE MAKE MONEY FROM HIM/HER. I just can't believe the ridiculous examples and the lack of any thought about the cost side of the operations. Have valet parking and own shooper assistant in a grocery store and STILL SAVE MONEY. Please, please first check the cost structure of a grocery store and see that their gross margins are rarely more than 3%. Buying from competitors and selling at what you pay for plus free wrapping? Hm, and the employee will be paid from where? Just don't want to contibue with the insulting and completely nonsense format of the book.... I rarely write reviews, but this one was so pretentious with nothing to back it up, that I just had to vent and warn - please never, ever try to read that book! 
 this is music for schizos who think sickness is the only way of "forward thinking" art like cannibal corpse relates to say iron maiden. but making music is in the case of david thomas the wrong way to the cure, oh i mean final solution. sorry. get yourself a job 
 I know I should not be allowed to judge a book based on its cover, its age, or the fact its part of a mystery series I've never read.  But this book was just awful.  I went into it not that excited...but I was interested to get back into mysteries since I'd stayed away from the genre for sometime.  The story essentially follows a sleuthing couple with no credentials to be detectives - Annie owns a murder mystery book shop (um yeah, cause that would fly on a small tourist island), and her husband Max helps people 'find stuff' or 'figure out stuff'.  The books is cliche-ridden and spun in an unconvincing way.  The first 100 pages are completely  lull-worthy and the investigation following the murder isn't much more interesting.  Essentially a much-disliked newcomer to the town is murdered on the fourth of July and a young, well-liked teenager accidentally finds the gun in the woods, fingering him as the suspect.  Annie & Max and a small ring of help band together to interview one of many key suspects - but there is a whole lotta suspects and clue-gathering to be done in 24 hours, and none of the motives were particularly strong or interesting.  Needless to say a 'surprise' twist does happen...but it's a genuinely trite and annoying one.  The prose itself is hard to get through - since Hart seems determined to prove that Annie really is a huge mystery fan there are paragraphs filled with references to authors and characters in the mystery genre that you just skip over.  The descriptions of things are far too lengthy and don't contribute to the plot.  The internal ponderings of the characters are frustrating and don't help you solve the mystery before you are told what happened.  The cliches that show up every few lines are painful to read.  I don't really have much else to report on this book.  I found it confusing, clunky, and utterly hard to get through.  Perhaps you are a fan of the series by Carolyn Hart (Death on Demand) but I don't believe I'll be picking up another.  There was nothing I particularly liked about this book to be honest, but it wasn't the worst I'd read either.  Skip this series if you are a serious mystery fan.  Final Grade:  
 i think Susan Sontag is missing the political nature of illness.  as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine.  the victim is blamed because the victim has little power.  the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful.  they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame.  this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power.  language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally 
 This book is so scattered and disjointed.  Topics don't flow, random jumps are made, and the text is written poorly to top it off.  If you're going to get a cell biology book, get Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fourth Edition by Bruce Alberts.  Might be a bit thicker but for the same price you get much better information 
 I opened this book very neutrally--I had never heard anything about Susan Sontag except her name, in a preface to an Annie Leibovitz book.  I still can't believe some of the things I read.  Sontag mentions in the foreword that she has an "obsession" with photography.  I would argue that she has an obsession with resenting photography. She begins by comparing a camera to a gun and the act of taking a picture to rape.  To a certain point, I can understand this--being photographed is a very self-conscious experience.  But somehow, I think rape victims would laugh at this comparision.  Self-consciousness is not exactly rape.  Also, she seems to believe that all photography is taken completely without the consent of the subject(s); they are innocent victims being raped by guns.  The last time I checked, most of the photographers she mentions (Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Edward Weston, Julia Margaret Cameron) took pictures only with express permission, and many (Eugene Atget, Ansel Adams, etc.) did not take pictures of people at all.  Almost all good pictures, with the exception of Henri Cartier-Bresson type photography, requires tacit consent between photographer and subject.   Sontag's resentment seems to come mostly from the resentment generated by photography's replacement of writing in description.  Specifically, she says that whereas photograpy "steals" the pain of others, writing uses only one's own pain.  This is funny, since I remember reading about how Jane Austen's neighbors complained because their lives were being stolen for her books.  Ever since the art of storytelling began writers and storytellers have been "stealing" other people's lives, their pain, etc.  Fitzgerald used Zelda's insanity just as David Bailey photographed Marie Helvin.  I believe that the art of writing and the art of photography are incredibly similar, and Sontag sounds very sour grapes.  How is Strand's photographing the famous "Blind Woman" different from Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood?" My biggest objection to Sontag, however, is her lack of either proof or explanation.  She simply states opinions as if they were facts, and then stops.  For example, according to Sontag, Weston is now regarded as antiquated and cliche.  Really?  Somehow I thought, considering the worth of his work, his exhibitions in museums, and the wealth of books devoted to him, as well as his inclusion in every basic photography class, that he was still very highly regarded.  I'm sure that Sontag regards him as antiquated and cliche, but this is very different from the "everyone" she generally to be present and in full agreement with her. Sontag also concentrates exclusively on one genre and attacks photography as a whole through that genre.  Diane Arbus's photos are apparently taking horrible advantage of everyone pictured in them, and are freakish visions of a bleak world--therefore all photographs in the world are taking horrible advantage and are freakish visions of a bleak world.  I can understand why some people find Arbus's photos terribly offensive, but I think only the extremely deluded would use her as representative of all photography. One last aspect of Sontag's book, which I found the most offensive, is her assumption that a picture is stealing the pain of others and, in a sense, profiting from it artistically.  This is despite her inclusion in her "Anthology of Quotations" of Richard Avedon's interview where he stated that the pictures he took of other people were more about him than about them.  Everyone who has ever practiced photography with any passion can testify to the truth of this statement, hence my conclusion that Sontag has probably never really picked up a camera.  Look at Avedon's pictures of a tortured Marilyn Monroe, and then read Arthur Miller's "After the Fall," which describes a tortured and pill-popping Marilyn Monroe.  There is very little difference, except that in Avedon's pictures Monroe still retains some amount of dignity, whereas in Miller's play she becomes a demon of hysteria and cruelty.  In the end, although I am both a photographer and a writer, I would say that writing has ten times the power of misrepresentation and "stealing the pain of others" than does photography 
 I sought history, facts, etc.  However, this book is written with such female-type hysteria that getting beyond the first chapter is a chore.  I am extremely disappointed.  The author obviously picked apart her research to slant the information with little or no care for common knowledge that disputes her claims.  Trash.  A definite loss of money here 
 Everything has been said about this product. When it's working, you're happy. With my 8 version, almost everything was fine. With the 10 version, it's a bloody nightmare. I'm giving up, throwing my Dazzle DVC150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my VHS to DVD. NEVER Pinnacle again 
 Yes, it's true that pharmaceutical prices are skyrocketing and that SSRIs are among the most frequently prescribed.  Yes, it's also true that SSRI's have been _associated with_ suicidal thoughts (causation has not been proved).  However, from personal experience with family, friends, and patients, I can also tell you that SSRIs have saved some lives.  One other reviewer points out that patients should be monitored very closely after starting a drug.  That's the real problem right there.  With declining reimbursements and increasing patient panels, primary care physicians are often not able to see patients within the first week or so.  That's the fault of the health care system, not the drug companies.  Frankly, we need a complete overhaul of the system, so that everyone can be assured of access to the standard of care that many of us enjoy 
 The author Thomas Carlyle presents the history of the French Revolution as a prophetic poetry of his intellect, and rightfully burned on his presentation for review.  As reading this book realize the great store of words and meanings that suited his direction rather than the true nature of the French Revolution of the peoples.  What an awful book 
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 To the point:  for much better quality, buy the U.K. version.  Not only is the picture clearer, but the synchronization between picture and sound is maintained to end of Liberty.  Yes, you'll have to buy an inexpensive Region 2 DVD player, or use your computer, but sooner or later you'll have to do this anyway if you want to see your favorite films before you die.  In this LOST series version of "Libery", for some reason the title "I wasn't nipping!" was re-filmed 3 times for a grand total of 17 seconds, putting the sound way, way ahead of the picture for the rest of the movie.  How could the distributors not notice this?  I always wonder how people stay in business these days with incompetence so rampant, and no one ever double-checks their work...  For historians, this is an interesting collection to watch once, mostly because it contains the first film L&H were in together 
 I am interested in and not at all antagonistic to theism, so I came to this book hoping it might shed some light on deep questions. Sadly, it doesn't. The author starts as he means to go on, framing his notion of God in such a way that pious Jews, Muslims and even many Christians would have to be called atheists. This may tell us something about the author but it tells us nothing about theism or atheism.  He does seem to be widely-read. The level is about that of Reader's Digest, but not so rigorous. David Hume, who raised questions that philosophers are still working out, is summarized and dismissed in two pages; Kant gets four. The Foreword likens this to 'a college course on philosophy'. Reading it reminded me of nothing so much as a primer of philosophy I once came across by a Catholic priest of the old school, for whom all thinking since Aquinas was self-evidently wrong and pernicious. How did he know? Well, that's what he'd been taught in seminary. In a word, this author knows the answers before he asks the questions. If you also know the answers (and they're the same ones) you may find his approach congenial.  The author seems to be a creationist of sorts; although, after devoting two chapters to this monumental non-problem and disparaging everyone from Darwin to the Leakeys, he never quite commits himself. The chapter on the modern argument from design is worth looking at if you haven't read those books with 'God' in the title by Paul Davies (who would certainly count as an atheist by this author's lights). Despite the blurb, the book has nothing but hair-splitting to contribute to the old conundrum of a loving, omnipotent God who tolerates natural evil, or the slightly less obvious stumbling-block of an omniscient God who is forever tinkering with his Creation. And the author thinks atheists have problems. It has to be possible to do better than this. I recommend the writings of John Polkinghorne, Cambridge Professor of Mathematical Physics turned Anglican priest (I think he qualifies as a theist), who recognizes a credibility gap when he sees one and credits others with the same integrity as himself 
 Shakespeare's play already contains plenty of time-shifts.  Ancient Athens meets fairlyland,  which in turn meets Elizabethan tradespeople-turned-thespians...adding layers of 19th century Italy to the mix,  and bicycles,  and windeup gramophones, and a repetitive recycling of Italian opera's greatest hits on the soundtrack,  just muddies things up.  Lots of money went into this production,  and it does have some nice visuals.  But there is no genuine artistic vision here.  Less would have been more.  The two stars are for the director's concept,  not for author William S., whose best lines are just about impossible to ruin 
 The songs in this collection are well chosen, but the first hint of trouble comes when you pop disc 1 in the player and your display says Nights In White Satin is 4 1/2 minutes long.  Yes, they cut the entire "Breathe deep the gathering gloom..." part.  Come on guys, you have 2 entire CDs to fill, don't edit the band's debatably greatest song. But the big problem is the sound quality. It's ok if not wonderful on disc 2, but all of disc 1, which is where most of the primo material resides, sounds compressed and hashy. The original Deram CDs made in the 1980s sound much cleaner, and they were made with relatively primitive equipment. This collection is ok to throw into a car stereo, but it wasn't made for people who love this music 
 Nicky Cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment, as he turns  in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi 
 This book represents Nicolas van de Walle's attempts to characterise Africa's political economy in the era of 'partial reform' in comparative perspective.  Unfortunately, this book which could have fulfilled an important lacunae in the field is largely a poorly thought out academic hustle.   The analysis  is full of mutually contradictory statements, and given the author's evident lack of familiarity with the cases he is comparing with S.S.A. his comparative analysis lacks any  bite or merit.  Nowhere is this more clear than in his comparisons between Africa and Latin America. For example, according to van de Walle Argentina is a considered 'especially' a case of committed and extensive reform.    Throughout the author cites and misrepresents work with which he is clearly unfamiliar and large sections are plagiarised from uncited sources. In particular, much of the book is plagiarized from my own work which van de Walle reviewed for Comparative Studiesd in Society and History.  According to that review -which van de Walle claims was done after the submission of his monograph, but which he had received well before submission, - Africa is unque in the extent to which rent seeking by those close to the regimes characterizes reforms.  It is, however, a central pillar of his monograph that this is a universal characteristic of reform.  The author also demonstrates a lack of familiarity with rudimentary social science concepts and cannot even distinguish for example between an African regime and an African State. These failings are glaring, and the book's neoliberal-ideological attempts to correct theoretical misunderstandings about the autonomy of the African state are thus rendered irrelevant.  It is clear that van de Walle has never read Weber and does not even comprehend the monograph's key concept neo-patriminonialism.    The author, furthermore does not even have an awareness of the literature on interest groups and reforms, rendering his critique of this literature meaningless and ineffective if not downright dishonest.   Any one with rudimentary familiarity of basic work such as Joan Nelson's, Przeworski's, Rodriks etc.. would be forced to conclude that this book is profoundly intellectually dihonest in the conclusions it draws.  Throughout the book, the author's personal value judgements are not accompanied by empirical support particularly where the author engages in the critique of other significant monographs in the discipline. For these reasons, despite sweeping pretense and fanfare the monograph fails to make a significant theoretical or empiraical contribution to the disciplines of comparative  and African political economy.  Presently, the matter of this monograph is before the legal department of Cambridge University Press. Litigation is now immanent. I have been represented in this matter by Fraser Milner Casgrain and have now retained a litigator. If you purchase this book you are supporting wholesale [...] and moreover any royalties will eventually come to me along with damages.  At any rate there are a range of other books which would serve you far better if you are trying to understand the political economy of Africa.  
 I exercise regularly, but found the instructions in this book difficult to follow, and the pictures were no help.  I expected color pictures that matched the book cover, but the images inside the book are grainy photos of the author.  Even with the pictures and instructions, I couldn't figure out some of the moves.  So, I spent more money on the DVD and the recommended split.  Huge waste of money!  The DVD was more annoying than the book because the range of movements for the exercises is so small, it's really hard see what you should be doing.     
 If you order this sword, you may not get what you see. Yes you will get the same 'style' of sword, but as for the look, forget it, the steel is pure black. Now if that's what you want great, I personally wanted the 'silver' steel look, but got the 'jet black' steel. Don't worry, it was the same sword, just a different color. 
 After reading reviews and listening to samples, I bought the cd.  Have to say, very disappointed.  I'm a big fan of Delerium, Zero 7, Cafe del Mar all of which are much better than this cd.  Even the new Sleepthief cd is more ethereal and listenable and I recommend 
 they were not as heavy weight as stated..to me they seem more like a regular t-shirt..and the size seems to be a little smaller than norm..after first washing, they really shrink.. I will not buy any more. 
 Well I think that this book was not the book I was looking for, it starts out well and very descriptive, but as you go on into the book it gets worse and worse, chapter by chapter. I personaly will probably never read another Jack London book because this one was so borring 
 Everyone else seems to adore this book so I guess I have lost my sense of humor because I just don't like this particular version-- at least not for the 3 and under set.    My first objection stems from the use of bug spray by the 'old lady' to get rid of the fly.  She is shown sitting on a couch surrounded by cans of depleted insecticide while spraying more in her mouth.  Rather than find this funny, it scared me to think that some child might get a notion to copy this activity.    Then second is my objection to boiling a cat and chasing a dog with the same intent.  Now most children wouldn't do this so that's not a problem but I still don't like the idea of introducing this weird concept to my little boy.  (My son asked me if we needed to keep our cat inside and safe from the neighbors - hmmm.)  The funny part of all of this is that I don't mind when the old lady just pops the animals down her throat.  Go figure.  In any case, Nadine Westcott is a good story teller and her artwork is clever, but I still have to give this book two stars because of the above reservations.          [A `Thought You Should Know' review 
 Eh..  this book was ok. interesting in the fact that it was written by a woman who is a "professional sex surrogate". if that's not a euphimism, I don't know what is.  written from a female perspective, it may seem to be an easy thing to do as she suggests, and some of her male 'colleagues' are reported to be doing these tightening maneuvers, however, just as some people may be able to roll their R's, their tongues, or cross their eyes, others simply cannot, for whatever reason.  I just think a little more disclosure would be prudent to avoid returns - :D  
 I am shocked how bad this book was.  The author is obsessed with racism yet makes sterotypes out of the folks who live in the town.  He comes across as a lightweight elitist who does not have the skill to write a book on such a complex issue.  He repeats himself over and over again and never really captures anything below the surface.  It is not surprising that so many loved this book as it does not tax the brain and patronizes those too foolish to realize they are being patronized. Plus it is so so boring 
 It is never a good sign when the highlight of a book is the introduction which, as another poster noted, created very high expectations for the compilation which unfortunately are left unfulfilled.  Some subjective commentary (4 stars good, 1 star poor):  1.  First, Do No Harm (1 Star).  Makes the cardinal error of focusing the story on a character and world nobody cares about.   2.  The Landing Party (1 Stars).  Kudos for making the focus on Sulu but points off for the tired "somebody died and I feel bad" storyline. 3.  Official Record (ZERO stars).  Like another poster said, Chekov and McCoy visit Iraq and McCoy quotes the Bible.  Incomprehensible that this made it into print and probably the single worst "Star Trek" short story ever written.   4.  Fracture (3 Stars). All this and Tholians too.  Like the other poster said, the inclusion of yet another "I got famous and now I don't know what to do with myself except feel and act obnoxious" character mars what could have been the top story in this collection.  5.  Chaotic Response (4 Stars).  The one story in the book that I'd like to see as an episode.  The McCoy characterization is dead-on.  Fine job! 6.  As Others See Us (2 Stars).  One of those stories that could fit in anyone's science-fiction universe.  Not bad, not good.  Just there. 7.  See No Evil (1 Star).  Great idea - what happens to Uhura after Nomad?  I didn't care for the story, complete with yet another helpless woman plea of "I'm not ready for this" and a nice assurance from big he-man James Kirk along with a Scotty "I'm just gonna go and beam down and get myself captured so somebody else can be a hero" jive.    8.  The Leader (1.5 Stars).  In which we find out how a man who lives a life of responsibility and leadership suddenly and inexplicably turns into an accomplice for attempted murder which I found entirely unlikely.  This one even features yet another hapless Klingon. Can we ever find a good, deadly Klingon who actually KILLS the intended target?  Note - the story is well written even if I didn't care for the writer's logic.     9.  Ambition (2 Stars).  A Sulu and Scotty story but I couldn't help but get the feeling that I've seen this "wow, this is a lifeform, not a ship" episode on Voyager or Next Gen or... 10.  Devices and Desires (3 Stars).  Great idea - where Starfleet puts all those things that everyone else runs into, like the Doomsday Machine.  This is probably the single best idea in the entire book, and could be a launching point for other stories, but a point off here for the 'gee, Klingons in our space, wonder how they got there' gimmick.   11.  Where Everybody Knows Your Name (2.5 Stars).  Like most comedies, either works for you or doesn't.  Gave it an extra 0.5 star for effort. 12.  Make-Believe (2 Stars).  Gerrold gives this his blessing as the best story in the book and while I appreciate the sensitivity of the author's intentions the hook is essentially the entire story and once you've read it once you won't want to read it again.  And did I mention this is the 2nd story set in Iraq?  This time, really in Iraq.  Is it really appropriate, in a book meant to celebrate 40 years of Star Trek, to include not one but two stories in Iraq?    So there you go (in order of quality) -   Season 1 Stories - Chaotic Response, Fracture, Devices and Desires Season 2 Stories - As Others See Us, Ambition, Make-Believe, Where Everybody Season 3 Stories - the rest except below   Turned Down - Official Record     P.S.  I find it ironic that so few people enjoyed this review but the messenger is never welcome.  The irony with "Constellations" is that in recent years Star Trek fiction has produced some terrific novels and anthologies geared to heavy watchers (like me) of every conceivable nugget in the vast array of episodes.  The sense of wonder that permeated the best of all the series is entirely missing from this mostly tired collection of recycled stories which don't do the series justice.  Clearly that's Palmieri's fault to some degree (though Prophecy and Change was a stellar work so maybe the subject is the problem) but the authors, when put in a situation of coming up with brand new ideas, obviously couldn't do it.  Perhaps that's not surprising - the best Star Trek novels weave fragments of existing plotlines to create a new exciting diversion but coming up with absolutely brand new ideas is surely far more difficult.  Just my opinion of course.. 
 A babbling stream of zen consciousness nonsense.   This book may be interesting to those who like new age poetry but if you're primarily looking to improve your writing craft - seek elsewhere.  There are a few nuggets of helpful wisdom here, but they are buried by reams of meandering memoir 
 I'm a beginer sewer.  I just took my first 2 lessons in sewing, and am able to use my machine to make simple things, like pillows.  I checked this book out from our library, and looked at the first project.  It seems pretty complicated, and I felt like there were some steps missing.  It was explaining how to create a simple apron, but the steps didn't all make sense to me.  I think this book is more for an intermediate sewer, who knows more of the terminology, and all ready understands basic sewing methods 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 The exercises in the book seem to be purposefully difficult.  Is this to discourage prospective copyeditors or so that Einsohn can show off her years of experience?  In order to be instructional, the explanations should fully cover the concepts that one will be tested on in the exercises.  Anyone who can read should be able to read the text and then successfully complete the exercises.  This is basic to good instructional design. Instead, in the exercises, Einsohn throws in the exceptions to the rules or tests on concepts only hinted at in the text.  Einsohn reminds me of the bad teachers we have all experienced at one time or another who get satisfaction from confusing students by talking around a subject instead of teaching the subject directly.  Success of students is not the goal of these teachers.  There are many finer points in copyediting, but there are sets of rules governing them all.  It should be a simple matter to present the rules and then test the student on those rules 
 BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, the textbook currently used in my Introduction to Management class, does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management.  The book is structured around eight 'roles' of an effective manager, and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role.  While I appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject, I do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow.  The reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency, and while meant well, they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper.  Furthermore, BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER stresses models and theories of management that I find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management, which are not adequately presented in the textbook.  Some of the models and theories have merit and should be discussed more in depth, but in a more advanced level of business management.  And while BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER is the official textbook for my management class, I have relied heavily on a different textbook for my information, and only the eve of a test do I bother to look over BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, I do not recommend this textbook for an introductory class at all 
 I know this is supposed to be a "cute" movie, but it is such a tired subject. It is "BIG" all over again....Granted, Jennifer Garner is much easier to look at than Tom Hanks....At least from this Male reviewers perspective. Garner is capable of SO MUCH more than this (Daredevil, Elektra). Garner is still good, as is Rufalo, and the film is good for what is supposed to be, it just falls a little flat due to it's re-tread subject matter. Still worth the $2 rental.....but not the late fees. 2 Stars 
 I love this book although I think The Stinky Cheese Man is a way better book. Beautiful, fun illustrations and a fun read 
 Mr. Lapin translation are very inaccurate. I woudn't pay a dime for this book 
 I hated this book alot. Miriam made the Indians seem disgusting and barbaric. She kept talking about how bad the Indians were and blaming her family for being captured, I really thought it was dull 
 and THEN come follow  Jesus orders us when someone asks for our coat to give our shirt as well.  It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to get into heaven. Or a capitalist. Jesus said it, not me.  Capitalism is the opposite of Christianity. Study carefully the National Conference of Catholic Bishop's landmark letter Economic Justice for All which damns corporate capitalism as currently practiced under the unelectable Bush regime.   Read the Rev. Father John Dear, SJ. Anything he wrote. Read the most saintly and Catholic Dorothy Day. Winess her life of Chritian witness.  Capitalists cannot be Christian. There is no profit in it. If someone wants your money you give it to them, with a joyful and sincere smile.  Read your Dorothy Day, the greatest American CAtholic EVER! Loaves and Fishes is a good place to start. She said not to give our old clothes to the poor; give them our new clothes instead.  Go back and read your Saint Francis too. What did he say? How did he read and live the Gospel? What did he have?  What would Jesus do? Amass wealth? What did he have when he died?  Even Karl Marx got it closer when quoting Saint Paul that the Christian Community derived from each member according to their talents and gave to each member according to their needs.  This is the OPPOSITE of capitalism which bleeds everyone through their needs (health, housing, food, education, clothing, etc.) and in which the rich alone get richer.  That ain't Christianity by any measure.  Christ leads to true freedom. Not capitalism. Meanwhile: Is the West a success?   And those who believe the hierarchcal church promoted the scientific method need only remember it was not a quarter century the church apologized to the late Galileo, and as recently as the pioneering (ought to be saint) Father Gregor Mendel the church burned his notebooks posthumously and prohibited his publication, of what has now become the basis of biology: genetic codes. 
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 I REALLY,REALLY HATE FOREIGNER AND I RANK THEM AS BAD AS GREEN DAY.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS DISGUSTINGLY AWFUL CD WHICH CONTAINS TRASH LIKE WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU WHICH HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST MORONIC AND STUPID SONGS EVER.GET ANY LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM INSTEAD 
 Muybridge's "The Human Figure in Motion" is a classic.  The frame by frame photographs of figures (male, female, athletes, children) are vintage photos from the latter half of the 19th century. They document action: carrying objects, a man jumping, child crawling, etc, as well as activities common to the time that are not evident in everyday activity now, such as discus throwing, fencing, woman pouring water from a jug, etc.  These photos, although small, are still of major importance to the artist who tries to understand muscle groups for drawing the figure.  Great resource book 
 My blood was boiling as I read other customers' rave reviews of "The Prince of Tides."  Whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature.  Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat Conroy to Virginia Woolf.  What a joke!  Woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real.  She cuts to the quick, whereas Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions.  One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story.  I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths.  In the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book.  They do not speak in reams of figurative language.  I cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children.  Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them.  (I make that claim as a Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.)  It's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.  Read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal (John Irving, etc.), but avoid it if you have any respect for the English language and for real American literature (Cheever, Plath, Hemingway, Cather, etc.).  Don't be fooled by all the fools out there.  
 I think that if you are into literature than you might like this book but I think that it wasnt as great as my professor said it was going to b 
 This product was nothing like how I expected it to be. The quality is terrible, do not waste your money on this item  
 The writer of this book has found the real threat to gays and lesbians:  radical Islam.  Really, what have Right Wing Christians ever done?  Nothing.  The NEA has more political power than Christians.  The Muslim aim is to take over the world and exterminate "infidels".  That's us.  That all of us.  The Christian right wing can't even stop graphic sex education at their local schools.  They are not a threat.  Heck, Christians are not a serious worry.  They are not a worry.  Do not buy this book.  It's obsolete.  The author, Bruce Bawer, says it's obsolete.  We can't ignore Islam.  Why?  All GLBT people will be eliminated by Islam.  That is a face.  Read Bruce Bawer's book "While Europe Slept."  We may actually want to be friends with Christians.  Why?  Islam means to destroy us all!  All good feminists should be worried. 
 I agree with the other customers of this guide that there is no detail except for in a few spots at all. I mean what do you do after you defeat all of the  the elite 4? And when you walk up to a trainer his pokemon could stink or they might whip yours. So whatever you do DON'T by this guide. Please 
 I returned the book. Cumbersome. Not what I expected after a promo on TV had gotten me interested. Signed up and doing Jazzercise instead 
 This disc is quite booty.  Please avoid 
 The history of the book when it was published tells it all. After a media blitz and great anticipation with what would be written - due to Brando pocketing an absolutely huge advance - the sales were so abysmal that it was discounted by fifty-percent or more less than two weeks after sitting mostly unsold on store shelves.  It was supposed to be the reflections of arguably the greatest actor of his generation, but unfortunately Songs My Mother Taught Me is nothing but psycho-babble with a text that can be read (skimmed) very quickly.   The only thing I determined was Brando very early in the writing process decided he was going to be as difficult on this "set" as he reportedly was with most of his film directors.    Next to Gerald Ford's brief and boring book published after his controversial presidency, Songs My Mother Taught Me is perhaps the most disappointing publication by a major public figure in the latter portion of the last century.  
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 This book mocks Christianity and God. Prior to purchasing this book, think about the implications. What if Betty is wrong and Christians are right?  Ultimately it is in your best interest to find out the truth.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  I strongly recommend reading books from the other side, such as Lee Strobel's books "A Case for Christ" or "A Case for Faith".  Lee Strobel is an attorney and investigator. He was once an atheist and worked for a Chicago Newspaper. His wife became a Christian and he set out to prove Christianity wrong. He spent many days investigating the Christian faith in the same manner as he would an investigative case.  At the end he ended up becoming a Christian.  He wrote about it in his first book "The Case for Christ".  C.S. Lewis and Josh McDowell also became Christians after similar attempts to "prove Christianity wrong".  These are all highly intelligent men who were once atheists.  Please don't be deceived.  The choice is yours.  And it's later than you think. 
 So much of this book seems to be devoted to the singular objective of conjuring up and applying technique--for the sake of conjuring up and applying technique.  How about heart, soul,and guts, the innards of what makes a truly great novel great?  After reading Conflict, Action, and Suspense I find not the slighest nod in this direction.  If, for example, you set out to portray a protagonist with deep-seated psychological problems, is it best to first think of how to create conflicts and actions for him / her, as Noble urges?  Or, is it best to largely monologue your way into the story in order to "set up" the forthcoming suspenseful situations you have in store for him / her?  If you carefully shepherd the reader's thought-flow by way of psychological portrait, isn't this a better setting of the stage for real life-like suspense to follow?  Sure, most writers of books on writing will tell you that you must make things get very ugly, very quickly. But, is this really the best way to paint the Celebrated Dreamer, The Simpleton, The Fool In Love, The Anti-Hero who believes his peers are all conditioned to suppose they can get rich "thinking" while other schmucks sweat?  ##### Noble writes well enough. And, there is no shortage of ideas in this book.  But, alas, the ring of "artificiality" is too much for me.        
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 There is a real novelty in this book: for the first time ever in Cannel's cosmology, a Latino character (Ram?n) is not directly associated with crime, dirt and grease altogether. Well ... he is an illegal immigrant, but hey!, you can't have it all 
 This exceedingly short memoir of a Swedish SS volunteer in the last days of the SS Nordland division in 1945 is short on real specifics yet long on multiple condemnations of the Bolshevik hordes. Wallin through Hillblad (the editor), gives little in detail on his unit or men he fought with. This contrasts with his unrepentant and relentless anti-Soviet propaganda which even reaches out to American flyers. Wallin conveniently forgets a couple of facts: (1) Nazi Germany was the aggressor nation in WWII., and (2) Wallin volunteered to fight for this criminal regime.   Apart from this, the quality of the Wallin's writing or recollection and Hillblads editing is very simplistic. Fictional works like the Forgotten Soldier capture the drama and action of the Eastern Front conflict much better and without the speeches. One star only and that is for the few pages of photos at the end of the book. "Twilight of the Gods" yeah, sure Erik 
 I bought this book soon after we adopted our daughter.  I found the writing style to be convoluted and precocious, much like the way children speak in contemporary movies (adult words from a child's mouth).  Sorry, not a fan.  We are still looking for a book that addresses an open, domestic adoption that can speak to children, not adults 
 Emotion and Evolution were CD's with a bit of an edge to them.  Her gutsy rhythm section and the simple guitar work on those albums gave her voice room to soar.    I think they were Martina's best work.  The single "Anyway" promised so much, but from what I am hearing on this album, it sounds very over produced.  It has range and polish . . . but no depth  . . . sorry all, but I am disappointed.   I believe she has gotten too involved in the production 
 I thought this book would have more recipes in it that I could use. Well, it doesn't. It's a great coffee table book. It's lovely to look at and very informative. If you're looking for the history of donuts and something to read while munching on one, here ya go. If you're looking for a cook book  - look elsewhere 
 I would not recommend this book for a little kid.  I've got two 3 year old girls and it's way too loud and way too grown-up for little kids.  I don't think it's appropriate. We have Philadelphia Chickens too and I would rate that a 5 star.  That one is inspiring.  This one is like letting your kid watch Saturday Night Live 
 I read this book years ago when it was first published.  Mr. Sick allowed himself to be taken in by a collection of Iranian liars as well as some phonies claiming to have experience in intelligence.  Some of the people Sick listened to were shown in the Iran-Contra hearings to be con artists who also took in Ollie North and Bill Casey.  These con artists are experts at saying what the listener wants to hear.  One guy claimed to have been in Special Forces and was an eyewitness to one of VP-candidate Bush's flights to meet with Iranians.  It turns out that he was not in Special Forces at all and he had been dishonorably discharged from the US Army.  In addition, he could not have been an eyewitness to the event he claims to have seen because he was in jail at the time.  The phony intelligence specialists have also been proven to be liars with no experience in intelligence or anything resembling national security work.  By the time I finished this book, I actually felt sorry for Sick because he had allowed himself to be taken in by these jokers.  He clearly wanted to believe that what he was being told was true.  This book does not prove anything except that even an experienced researcher can be fooled if he really wants to believe.  Subsequent investigations by a Democratically dominated Congress proved that there was no October surprise 
 George has always been my favorite Beatle.  I have been celebrating his birthday and got the Concert for george Harrison and watched it on his deathdate, and even wrote my 6th grade biography on him.  So, I turned to this book.  There were plenty of grammatical errors and false information.  I think that it said in the front that he didn't "hassle any of the beatles for this information" then how could he even get information such as this.  Go to I, Me, Mine it's a better book because its WRITTEN BY HARRISON HIMSELF!  
 I agree with the other two machinists/gunsmiths.  The drawings were terrible and sometimes the tolerances didn't add up.  This manual is good for a general idea on a design and nothing else.  I completed mine and it shoots great but not before I redesigned about 30% of it.  Don't listen to the one guy.  It's obvious he's never cut a chip in his life 
 This book is an interesting collection of chapters, interviews and ideas by Drucker.  There are a handful of good ideas, but as a whole, the book is disjointed and no clear point or argument is raised.  While it is good fodder for quotes, don't expect to emerge with any great ideas or new perspectives 
 I purchased this book with the idea that it could be a good reference guide for a student I have been working with.  I would have returned the book if I could have.  Although it is focused toward the wandering teen, it's ideas are too scarce.  The ideas within are not necessarily focused to any one religion, but a mix of all the different aspects that the author has put together as wicca.  This is a choice that is made by the practicioner, and nowhere in this book does it stress this opinion.  For those who would like some fun reading about what fantasy religion could be, this would be the book for you.  For those who really need some insight into pagan or wiccan religion/spirituality should look elsewhere 
 This would have been an interesting and original view of the problem of persistent poverty in the U.S. had it been published, oh, about thirty or thirty-five years ago.  As it is, it grossly oversimplifies a complex problem, and worse, plays to the cherished superstitions of neoconservative intellectuals and their `lumpen' readers alike.  It will probably come as a great surprise to the author, but I doubt poor black, Hispanic, and hell, even poor white kids have ever even heard of Norman Mailer, much less studied his essays in school.  It may also have escaped the author's attention that inflation whittled the value of payments from programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children down to a fraction of 1960's levels, even factoring in occasional cost-of-living increases-which had all but ceased starting in the 1980's.  Finally, under the impetus of a conservative Congress, the Clinton administration undertook reform of "welfare" in 1996 which included drastically tightening eligibility requirements, placing strict time limits on receipt of benefits, and actively directing recipients into jobs.  Yet poverty seems to persist despite the implementation of conservative nostrums and even more amazingly, despite a near-full employment economy at the end of the 1990's.  In other words, trying to blame everything on kids who grew their hair long in the 1960's, and vapid socialites hobnobbing with Bobby Seale at Leonard Bernstein's soirees forty years ago is not only not right-it isn't even wrong    Meanwhile, since the Nixon administration we have conducted a "War on Drugs" that has stuffed prisons full to bursting with (mostly low level) drug dealers and users-nearly all of them minorities--but accomplished very little else. Although crime rates have in fact dropped to historically low levels, this seems to have little if any correlation with incarceration rates, which have been relentlessly rising since the 1970's.  This decrease in crime, by the way, confounded neoconservative predictions at the beginning of the 1990's that crime-allegedly inspired by our evil culture-would continue spiraling upwards without letup.  Similar decreases occurred in out-of-wedlock births, but as an old saying goes, "A lady's reputation seldom improves."  Especially when she is a member of a racial minority, I might add.  It would seem that the underclass owes very little to the 1960's counterculture, although Encounter Books-once a source of urbane and intelligent works-would probably not have taken Mr. Magnet's manuscript had he concluded as much.  Neoconservatives, it turns out, are as rigidly locked into a mindless party line as the 1960's leftists they criticize.  For example, black social scientists such as Glen Loury and William Julius Wilson were clutched to neoconservative bosoms when their research found that blacks suffered relatively little racial discrimination in hiring compared to past decades.  They were dropped like hot potatoes however when their continued investigations showed that minority unemployment had a lot more to do with factors such as the virtual disappearance of even low-skilled work from most urban areas, and the lack of transportation to exurban areas where most job growth was.  Kind of makes blaming the 1969 Woodstock festival look silly, to say the least.  There is no doubt that there is something that was once called "the culture of poverty" that inculcates some of the poor with self-defeating attitudes and behaviors.  This was already old hat by the time "London Labor and London Poor" was published during the Victorian age.  Presumably, the Victorian poor did not become or remain so because of Janet Jackson displaying her bosom on television a century later.  There are innumerable other criticisms to be made of this book starting with its confusion of drug-taking behavior among the poor (which tends to seek oblivion from hopelessness) with middle-class drug taking behavior (which is usually risk-seeking or thrill-seeking), but a complete enumeration of its mistakes, misconceptions, and half-truths would take an essay nearly as long as the book itself.  Suffice it to say that instead of being random, the errors all seem to point in a certain political direction.  Readers may conclude what they will about the author's presumed good faith from this.  Those looking for `just-so-stories' to confirm their darkest prejudices towards racial minorities and justify doing nothing will certainly find what they seek in this book.  Those looking for nuanced discussions aimed at trying to solve problems instead of finding scapegoats will have to look elsewhere 
 I have read all of Bryson's books and loved them. Intuition said to NOT but this book since reliving childhood has been done time and time again. In my opinion, the TITLE of this book is the only creative part of the book - sure, Bryson can be funny but this book reeks of being forced. Really not worthly of what the author has done in the past. We have heard all of this before. Save your money or go to the library 
 "The Book of Honor" is an extremely well written account of the lives and families of CIA agents who died for their country.  Unfortunately, the author spends more time describing the homes where these heroes grew up rather than the circumstances under which they perished.  Not only does it not place enough emphasis on covert operation (or the reasons for them), the book is written from an antagonistic perspective.  Throughout the book, the author continually takes jabs at the CIA and U.S. covert operations community.  There are some interesting historical facts lightly sprinkled through out its pages, but not nearly enough to make it worthwhile.  If you want a little action and insight into the lives of individuals as CIA operatives, please look for another book to read.  If you are looking for mundane letters between boyfriend and girlfriend or mother and son, this book is for you 
 This is a very interesting adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, featuring a plethora of major British actors from the time this movie was made. Note that today's younger audience, weened on an MTV diet of rapid cuts and incredible CGI, may find this slow. But if one can get beyond that, it's most definitely worth a watch.  That said, this DVD transfer is basically UNWATCHABLE. It's not clear what source they used for the transfer, but there are TERRIBLE audio pitch problems throughout the movie, with wow and flutter horribly apparent. This is particularly problematic for a movie like this with a significant orchestral and vocal score. If you have any sense of pitch, you'll find yourself pulling your hair out listening to the off-key strings! The video quality is pretty horrible, as well--worse than standard cable. A real travesty 
 In some translations, Baudelaire creeps up and stabs you. In this one he just sits and broods, smoking a hookah.   Richard Howard reduces Baudelaire to a pleasant middle-voice from which he speaks with only occasional eloquence. The translator here is a poet who is sensitive to the meaning of each poem, but he hasn't focused his energy enough on crafting his translations to contribute much that is better than the translations already done.  His introduction reveals that he is concerned more with "articulating a sustained structure" (in which he succeeds) than with giving any poem its "individual varnish" (in which he fails). The result, of course, is that few of these poems are brilliantly presented IN THEMSELVES, and we can appreciate this translation only if we read all the poems in sequence, thinking about their relationships.  Translation of Baudelaire demands a focus on every word, every line, every cadence. This translation has an agenda; it tries to capture only a fraction of the poet.  Most of these translations do not rhyme; and yet they are not literal translations either. The popularity of this book is that Howard makes everything sound plain and sensible. It is only when you look at the French that you realize how uncanny the original poems are. This book does not convey Baudelaire's lyric intensity, mainly because it abandons the music of the original. Howard is so bent on making everything plain English that he utterly misses the thundering rhythms of a poem like "Le Vampire". He translates "Toi qui, comme un coup de couteau / Dans mon coeur plaintif es entree" as "Sudden as a knife you thrust / Into my sorry heart." Bleh! What a lazy translation! Of course you CAN translate it that way, but it destroys the music of the poem, which severely weakens the reading of Baudelaire.  N.B. It's awkward to review a whole book of translations, since certain attempts will obviously be more successful than others. Howard is quite sensitive to the poetry of the original (he never misinterprets) and certain lines in these translations are indeed wonderful moments of poetic understanding: such poems include "Sorrows of the Moon", "I spent the night..." and "L'Heautontimoroumenos" in which he writes "I am the vampire at my own veins."  These are the finest translations in the book. Unfortunately, they're the exceptions, and other translators have written stunning translations far more accomplished than the typical translation here 
 This book is pretty much standard for undergrad analytical chemistry but it is not a great text.  It provides a very basic introduction to analytical methods in a poorly organised fashion.  The information is presented in such a way that it calls for you to memorize rather than understand.  The mathematics presented confuse the reader more than they help.  I recommend you buy this used.  If you plan on pursuing analytical chemistry, this book will quickly be shoved aside to make way for much better books, each specific to a particular instrumental method 
 This textbook is missing so many of the key ingredients that make a good textbook -- I am still amazed at the large amount of instructors that continue to use this inefficient and lacking text as their main instruction manual.  Using this in a circuits course probably will not help you and will make the subject more confusing most likely.  If you have a poor instructor as well, consider yourself lost for the class.  Get another text.  The examples in here are so simple but then the homework problems make these conceptual leaps that prove quite challenging for students -- even engineering students.  This book needs quite a bit of improvement before I would use it as my main circuits text 
 Allison announces in his first sentence of his Preface that this, the 2nd edition of a book originally published in 1983 is "substantially revised," and so it is, especially the last half of it. It was an important work of scholarship 23 years ago, and a revision after so much time during which he has remained a teacher and scholar specializing in Kant, was bound to excite  broad interest.  It must have gone far toward gaining for him the prestigious prize of $30,000 he was awarded last year (2005) for outstanding Kantian scholarship.    In the preface Allison cites Michelle Grier as having awakened him from his dogmatic slumbers.  In the body of the text he mentions her name only once, but given the compliment to her, my curiosity was aroused.  First I looked at the endnotes in which her work was mentioned by Allison, and then, a little puzzled, I looked carefully over her book, Kant's Doctrine of Transcendental Illusion, published in 2001.  I found many citations of her work in the endnotes.  Adding them up, I found that there were 28 endnotes, these referred, by explicit citation, to 200 pages of her 305 page book.  What one finds in comparing the two books, his and hers, is that every idea or argument that Allison advances and almost every reference, citation to Kant or to other philosophers, supposition, hypothesis, or development is to be found explicitly in Grier.  It is impossible to compare the two books and not conclude that Allison had no new ideas of his own at all, at least for the last half of his book, the half that he claims developments in Kantian scholarship had compelled him to fully and carefully rethink and therefore to have most fully revised.  If one were to remove from Allison's book, however, the ideas, arguments, and so forth that he derived directly and unambiguously from Grier, there would be nothing but minor and for the most part exceedingly trivial asides. It would, to put it simply, not have been publishable.  It is apparent that rather than generously recognizing Michelle Grier by his compliments and endnotes, he was stabbing her in the back.  His "generous" remarks have the effect of diminishing her role in his accomplishment.  He makes it seem as though she inspired him or set him on the right track rather than to have fashioned the final intellectual product that he merely, but arrogantly, rephrased.  Nowhere does he acknowledge the incontestable truth, as of course he cannot, that he was himself entirely empty, and given a choice between remaining silent or stealing from the younger, creative scholar, Michelle Grier, the work he wished he had produced himself, he chose the shabbier but more profitable course.   
 This book was written in the '80s was copy written in 1990.  It has a folksy tone and some technical information.  Unless you are buying your church's sound system at a second hand store, this book is going to leave you wondering what might be available today.  For example: "CD recorders are under development".  
 this is music for schizos who think sickness is the only way of "forward thinking" art like cannibal corpse relates to say iron maiden. but making music is in the case of david thomas the wrong way to the cure, oh i mean final solution. sorry. get yourself a job 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 McMurry's text is a very friendly, gentle intro to  organic. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to  know.  Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the  problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and  synthesis problems, in particular).  If you're looking to become a chemist,  this is not the book to learn from. I'd recommend  Vollhardt and Schore's  textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the  skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e.,  on exams or out in the industry) 
 This volume is disappointingly lightweight. Notwithstanding the comment of another reviewer who allegedly spent several evenings reading it, one can easily read it in 2 hours or even much less. The pages have relatively few lines of text, and those lines are widely-spaced. Almost 30% of the book (55.5 pages out of 190, other than intro and index) is filler, comprising biographies repelete with photos of the chapter authors in their Formula 1 racecars, running in a triathlon, rubbing their dog's belly, etc., and lots of information about their hobbies, or else pages that are completely blank but for brief epigrams by the likes of Benjamin Franklin, Mark Twain and Herman Melville.  The substantive focus is almost exclusively on patents, with a dash of trade secrets thrown in. On the plus side, writers from IBM, HP and Intel have good stuff to say about licensing strategies. But the book doesn't say much about the strategic side of building a portfolio -- e.g., you won't find any mention of designing around, the doctrine of equivalents, walls, fences or flooding. Many of the articles exalt the delights of suing people. The authors voice opposing views about patent trolls, but the discussion is surprisingly black and white, with little nuance (e.g., no discussion about whether there should be different remedies for different sorts of patent owners).   A frequent refrain throughout the book is that up to 80% of many companies' value is in IP and intangible rights. But actually, good luck trying to get 80% of your market cap by selling off your IP portfolio. In the context of this book, the statistic is misleading in several respects. First, the percentage is based on the gap between the market capitalization of a company and the book value of its tangible assets.  Much of the value in this gap is in goodwill and brand, i.e. trademarks and related rights, which aren't discussed in this book at all. Second, the debate over whether market cap accurately reflects fundamental value would fill many books the length of this one. Lastly, the valuation of patents is especially context-dependent. A patent's value can only be determined by  licensing or selling it to someone else, or by using it in litigation. For most companies (trolls aside), only a small percentage of their patents will ever be litigated. It's hard to predict which ones those will be, and even harder to predict the financial outcome of the case. And the percentage that are licensed is usually well under a majority (and in many cases is zero). All these issues complicate the attribution of value to patents. But aside from some brief discussions of patent quality in one or two chapters, you won't find such issues grappled with in this book.  The three or four best articles, such as the one by M. Phelps about IBM's licensing program, are way too short and general to give you much guidance on how to implement a strategy at your company. They're like tantalizing hors d'oeuvres -- whereas the book is priced like a full meal (or a very fancy entree, at least). As for the balance, there are plenty of websites and blogs where you can get articles of comparable depth and insight for free. So buy this book used, or read it in a store. A meatier book about patents generally, including portfolio strategy, is Knight's "Patent Strategy for Researchers and Research Managers"; and about licensing programs, a pretty good choice is Parr and Sullivan's "Technology Licensing: Corporate Strategies for Maximizing Value." You may spend more on those, but they're much better value for the price. 
 If you like reading about a self-absorbed painfully unfunny character (even though the author apparently thinks that there is humor here), you will love this book.  Nothing new, here 
 Look, the fact is feminism is about CHOICE no more, no less. I have the highest respect for stay at home moms--it is the hardest darn job on Earth. But this woman is WAY off base to say that feminism sold us a lie. Feminism GAVE us a choice. It told us we did not HAVE to pretend to believe we were June Cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls.   Personally, I could not have children and ONLY feminists have not made me feel like an alien species. I work with troubled teens, my skills do not go to waste, I spoil my nieces and nephews--I am fulfilled and happy. My sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys, she is fulfilled and happy,FEMINISM gave us those choices, ladies.   We were not "sold" ANYTHING, we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us. IF you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world's most important job, I think that is YOUR issue and not NOW's. Stop blaming feminism for YOUR insecurities, if you are feminist--stop blaming your mother for your insecurities--you have choices BECAUSE of FEMINISM not despite it! 
 I live in Seattle but my girlfriend lives in Vancouver so I spend time there, and I like the city.  I bought this book hoping for a companion to the city with at least a little bit of content.  I was also attracted by the title, as I like the glassy Vancouver skyline and thought this might be a book by someone who appreciates the same things about the atmosphere of Vancouver that I do.  Unfortunately, this is one of those books where the amount of content fit for an article in, say, the Georgia Strait or the Seattle Weekly, is blown up to the size, and price, of a book.  The pages are white space with one or two paragraphs of large text in the middle that touch very briefly and vaguely on some topic, as if the author jotted this all down one night and didn't put much thought into it.  The book also contains photographs which, rather than being an insider's look at Vancouver, could be photographs of any city out of any tourist magazine--the typical closeups of food on a plate at a nameless restaurant, or a house that could exist anywhere in North America.  Because this is the length of an article, only blown up to look like a book, you could walk into a bookstore or library and read it pretty quickly, and the only reason to purchase it would be if you absolutely must own every single book by Douglas Coupland, or every single book about Vancouver.  This book left me wanting to read a real book about Vancouver from which I might learn something new 
 Windows XP, and basically any other windows based OS is junk. After using Windows 3.1, 95, 98SE, 2000, ME, and XP, I was getting very sick of the same old boring basic programs. Linux however, has tons of programs with a lot of extra features to it. Spellcheck is one. I have to buy Microsoft Word or some other office program for spell check, and how much?!?! I'll tell you one thing, it ain't free. Linux however, there is spell check, and not just in their word processor. I also found this in their messenger program, email, and even in web browsers, free!  The other thing I hate about Windows is "You must activate your copy, and only one copy per computer". With linux, there is no activating, or "one per computer". You don't have to fear changing hardware and having to call in to reactivate, typing in a ton of numbers and answering questions. You can give someone a copy of linux, and they can try it, for free, and for life! It's not 30 days free, or free for only a few people, it's free for everyone for life!  As for one who mentioned that Linux releases more fixes than Windows, that is true. The difference between Windows and Linux when it comes to releases is like this. When Microsoft finally gets the operating system done enough, they will release it. Linux will release free their OS/software right away. You can download it right away as it becomes available or simply wait until they fix the bugs. So in other words, let's say both OS's have the same software. Day 5 comes along, and this software pretty much works, but may have some bugs. Linux will release this, and you have the "option" of installing it and trying it out, or wait until more bugs are fixed. Windows will not release this until it is more offical and finished. This is why linux has a lot of patches, they give it to you when they first get it going, and as they continue to improve this, you can enjoy it right away and not have to wait so long.  It is also true that Windows can be attacked by viruses within hours, where as linux can take several days/weeks/months. Also, Linux has been proven to give your hardware/computer a longer life span. It can also work better with older hardware so you don't have to be compelled to upgrade all the time.  Why not try out linux? It's a lot cheaper, and you may be amazed by how great it really is. I prefer Mandriva 2006. It's a great system.  Final note -  Windows: Very costly, even more so to get the benefits/features Linux: Free  Windows: One per computer, or buy more licenses Linux: One copy to everyone for life, or each person can have a copy for life  Windows: Boring; basic programs Linux: Several programs, multiple browsers, more than one type of software to fit your needs.  Windows: New hardware/reformat PC: You must spend time on phone and answer questions and type in SEVERAL numbers to activate your PC. Linux: New hardware/reformat: Here's your OS installed; you're good to go!  Windows: Constantly gets attacked by viruses Linux: Quite a lot safer  Windows: Support? lol. Yeah, there may be some Linux: Various sites where you can ask questions for free and get help on your OS  That's just some of the reasons why I love linux 
 This book was a reading for my 3rd grade daughter.  I have no idea how or why this book EVER won an award, unless it was for being the most boring yet deppressing book ever written.  And the illustrations were just as sad 
 This book is one of Dean Koontz's worst.  Not as bad as THE TAKING, but right in there.  OK, here is the plot ... really, really bad guy kills girl and parents.  A girlfriend witnesses and escapes only to find herself in the hunt for really, really bad guy.  Girlfriend chases really, really bad guy and craters the guy, but that's not all.  During this (yawn!) high drama, the heroine finds a little girl that really, really bad guy has (yawwwwwn!!) captured.  After knocking off the really, really (yawwwwnnnnnn!!!) bad guy, heroine rescues little girl and adopts her. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!! Oops, sorry, I nodded off.  Please Dean, can you recall this book?  I mean we aren't asking for an apology here -- just take this piece of junk off the market.  I did see where "new and used" has it for as little as 1 cent.  Uhhhhhh!  DON'T SPEND IT !!! It is not worth it !!!!  And Dean, when you are going to give your email address out to the fans?  Most authors do this.....but, you seem to be reluctant.  Could it be literary cowardice?  Inquiring minds want to know.    Much of Dean's work is excellent ..... this book isn't.  Densel Myers Yukon, Oklahom 
 Being an engineer in the aerospace industry I was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a "hard industry." I personally believe that it's in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that's the foundation of real wealth, not legal services or newswires. So this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation, give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is, and suggest ways to improve it. Oh, how very, very wrong I was . . .    This book started off strong, . . . for about four pages. After that a litany of tortured logic, un-sourced assertions, facts taken completely out of context except for the author's subjectively added adjectives, Orwellian double-speak, sleight of hand arguments, flat out ridiculuos statements, contradictory assessments, and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left George Soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century.   Even a broken watch is correct twice a day though, so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating. These include:   - Manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry, creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs, provided it's run right. (A big if.)   - High wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive.   - Americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates.   - There is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view, leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain. (i.e. Enron)    A scholarly, fair, and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful. This is not what you'll get in this book though. Instead you'll get:  A begining section about postindustrialism, things like the internet, information technology, financial services, etc., the things that make the services based economy. In three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates, instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument. Not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men, set them on fire, and piss on the smoldering remains. This is where vitriol even comes out, where he equates the post-industrialists to people incapable of even thinking. If someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument, they probably don't have one. Most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist. To me, this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to, oh, I don't know, let's say a fish.  A middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing. This is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there's no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large. This is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data, charts of GDP growth over time, pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services, manufacture, agriculture, etc. You will get none of that. There's little value except in reassuring the obvious, high wage nations CAN do manufacturing. Many of these cherry-picked anectdotal examples still don't quite dove-tail with all his claims about manufacturing though! You also know you're being left in the dark with a plethora of CYA disclaimer statments like "while Industry_X has certainly had its share of problems recently . . ." at the begining of a section.     A final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez-faire, free markets, and the concept of free trade. George Soros and a bunch of other lefties, with Pat Buchanan thrown in for "balance", should be listened to instead.   The worst part of this book is the author's lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument. Examples of twisted thinking abound:  - A post-industrial "industry" grows five times over in a certain period. The author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad. Later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60%! Self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise. The author's challenge to the reader seems to be "who are you going to believe? Me, or your lying eyes?"   - He rips into American post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because Americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world. Later he talks about how great German manufacturing is because Germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world's workers.   - The only facts he presents - and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions - are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context. When describing service industries "paltry" $50 million revenues, "only" 60,000 jobs, "disappointing" 24% of revenues from foreign sources is common. But when describing manufacturing "a very high" $6 million revenues, "a good mix" of 1,500 jobs, and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow. A number in and of itself means nothing. The fact the author leaves out any head on, direct comparison between industries is telling.   - Official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes. When the official figures don't agree with him, he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong. When attacking his straw men though, he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner.    - Gems of Orwellian double-speak sentences include examples like "Solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity. (pg. 184)" I.e. it's competitive where there is NO competition! And "Even in Singapore, one of the freest societies in the East, the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings . . . (pg. 229)" That's not very free if it's FORCED is it? (His defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages I've ever read and really is worth the price of the book. He capstones it with the "most encouraging" observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out - that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make!- to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out. Wow, what an achievement. Any ACTUAL power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it's internal workings wear out, but whatever . . .)  - Americans are dumb and the only successful American companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards. The American economy, despite the statistics, is in bad shape. The Japanese instead are eight feet tall, can read people's minds and see through lead. The Japanese economy, despite the statistics, is in really great shape. This type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims, and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments. The author basically can't get out of his own way.    - He always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they don't put numbers into context, are using twisted logic, making mere assertions instead of quoting facts, etc., apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses!  - He claims Boeing is no longer a good company because 30% of components in a Boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs. 2% in the 1960's. This is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper. America isn't doing that badly in aerospace by the way. The author fails to mention that 50% of the "European" Airbus is made in America. This is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient.   The list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions. You'd have to buy the book to see them all because there's at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page.   All in all, this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity. It's really a mercantilist argument, and the only common thread that I could see in all the author's cloudy reasoning is that nation's should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what. It's NOT, unfortunately, a book about how to revitalize American manufacturing in a globalized world. 
 A book I could live without.  Writing and phases were very amateurish.  A  few phrases that should have been explained weren't.  I kept wondering why  I was even trying to finish the book. It was like a busy design with too  much disassociated action going on and never quite tieing in together 
 This is an atrocious book.  The author's "professional job search" is an excuse to trash career counselors, fat people, and Christians--people that, judging from the prejudicial attitudes expressed in this book--Barbara despises, with a capital D.  Despite her lazy job search and a faked resume--I question her ethics--Ms. Holier-Than-Thou found two jobs.  Wasn't that the whole point? As one reader below notes, she turned them down because they weren't good enough for her. She clearly has her private demons, and "professional level work" may be one of them.    Barbara's book makes me think that she must be extremely insecure.  She doesn't want anyone to think she is less than competent.  Maybe that's why she rejects help, lashes out, criticizes others, and refuses two job offers.  Insecurity.    I wanted her to take one of the two jobs she was offered, or find something good enough for her.  But she chose to do neither.  This is a book about how hard it was for poor old (sniff!) Barbara to find a job.  Brace yourself for boredom and anger.  Maybe she would have been better off in a self-help group. Spare us, Barbara!    
 One of the worst imitations of Faulkner that I've ever read. 
 This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.  The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.  If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed 
 I'm an HSP who can [at least currently] not work due to having been a former physical/psychological torture victim at my work-setting at the hands of a boss [for about 2 yrs; almost being killed, even] who finally was arrested & who is now certifiably labeled an "anti-social personality."   As a result of of the torture I endured, I'm physically [in a wheelchair & have an implanted morphine pump] and emotionally severe PTSD] disabled [8 years now].   I read through this book, hoping to find a glimmer of hope for someone in my situation to be able to work, again.  I found nothing encouraging. [I agree with "Karen's review" from June 29, 2004]. Sure it would be great if we could all work together or magically switch to those almost non-existent positive for the worker companies. They don't even exist, except of course if you work for yourself--usually in a job involved in creativity.  The book suddenly started to remind me of the extreme naiivete of an author I used to know--Chauncey Hare. Hare, the self-proclaimed expert on and champion of the work abuse victim & co-author of "Work Abuse: How to Recognize and Survive It."   Then, I realized that when author Barrie S. Jaeger quoted Hare and his wife Judy Wyatt as the essentially the first pioneers in work abuse knowledge & expertise, I wondered if this book wasn't spawned by either reading Hare's book "Work Abuse: How to Recognize it..." or if Jaeger knew or perhaps interviewed Hare & Wyatt--the dynamic duo of alleged work abuse heros.  Ironically, a quote on "Making Work Work...", pp. 83-4 mentions how Hare [& Wyatt] consider "abusive bullying and 'mobbing'" --  H&W's definition of "work abuse -- that such changes can basically change a good/"effective" worker into a "difficult" person [worker] -- the end results of what is work abuse.   As for the only essential solution being: getting a job as a self-employed worker; this is not a viable solution to most. Sure, if you are allegedly creative and maybe can write--that might be an option.   [Note: As an aside, in an interview-story I did with Hare that had appeared on Tim Field's "bully on site [of the UK] pages," [my story "ironically" was "killed" after Hare & I had a falling out]. In short, one of my piece's themes dealt with how Hare claimed he was disablingly work abused. Thus he, also, became self-employed as a therapist/author for the work abused. The problem is, though, in our communications Hare revealed to me some discouraging deliberately published falsehoods in his own work-abuse book a case study altered so "readers would believe it."  My point is: After reading through Jaeger's book I couldn't trust the book's info at all, since it quoted as a source a propagator of lies 
 I just couldn't listen to the whole CD.  Kind of a disappointment from her last cd "Liz Phair."  That CD was great...this one not so much.... I purchased this cd as a gift to someone (without hearing it), and they, too, were disappointed 
 I'm usually pretty easy-going and tolerant of things, even discs that freeze or skip here and there, providing it isnt too annoying. My season 1 set of Knight Rider had a bit of these in a few of the episodes, but I was always able to fastforward over the offending few minutes and just get on with things. Man I am so annoyed about my copy of A-Team season 2. I love the A-Team and I just want to watch the episodes but I cant get anywhere with this set. Disc 1 is just useless. The 1st episode on side A plays ok, 2nd episode goes okay til about six minutes from the end then dies, cant be read. Episode 3 on this side cant even be acknowledged by any dvd player Ive tried. Similarly on side B, first episode on that side okay, 2nd one cant be read, third one goes about 16 mins before dying. Give me a break! I paid money for this thing! I see other people have had similar problems, but not everyone, which means I was just unlucky with my set. Can anyone help me though - how do I contact Universal about this? I cant find any relevant email addresses on their websites. Has anyone complained about a similarly faulty copy and received a replacement? If anyone at all can give me some email address by which I can contact them, PLEASE do, because its really annoying to have paid good money for something I can not use. Thank you 
 Bryson is certainly witty. But any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author's snotty and obnoxious tone. I can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits; there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self-image. What a whining, immature, mean jerk. And by the way, there's a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book. 
 I read this as a greek woman who does not consider herself "the typical greek". Which means that if you asked every person in my life if they thought I would "go greek", every person would say with 100% certainty that I would remain indepedent. With all that being said, I picked up this book for a good light read about a world that I myself sometimes do not feel completely comfortable in. The book was terrible, I had to push myself to finish it because all of the characters were so flat and unlikeable and the writing was so green. Most people will read this book because of the back cover summary and the close up of the pledge's chests in their P.U.'s (personal undergarments) on the front.  If you have to read it, borrow a friends copy or from the library - please don't reward this author. 
 "Time on the Cross" is a very well written book. That is all it is! It uses information from small spacific areas of the south and generalizes it for all of the south. Just because it happens in one area of the south doesn't mean that it happens every where. People that read this book may think that they are getting a new look at the south but really they are getting a bunch of numbers that makes it look like the south was not that bad of a place. This book depicts people as rational people who always think things out. This book depicts the south as though the slaves were being treated well as far as eating, sleeping quarters, and medical care. This is a good book for showing how bad clieometrics can go wrong. I just hope people will not take this book to heart for if they do they will be very misinformed as to how the south was. Fogel and Engerman only use information from specific areas, such as New Orleans. They doen't take into consideration about the human nature of people. This book, if not explaned in detail could do some harm to the view of the south. This book does use statistics very well but it doesn't give the big pitcure. The only reason I would recomend this book is if someone wants to see a different way of writing or how data could creat different aproaches about historical events, good or bad 
 Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.  
 the mic's quality is okay but i tried using it with my iriver mp3-player and my computer and i get that really annoying white noise in the background all the time (it's really loud). before you buy it check out some sample-recordings on the internet if you are interested in high quality 
 This is a book written by one of the worst violator's of human rights.  He should be justly punished, perhaps with his own methods.  If one could look at it as Horror/fiction ala Stephen King, it could send a chill up your  spine 
 I rented the film version of "A Home at the End of the World" shortly after catching the "The Hours" on cable. I was pretty impressed with both. My guess was that "The Hours" had the kind of budget and richness to capture the book, whereas "A Home..." was a small independent film that had more handicaps. I figured the book on which it was based would be a better introduction to Cunningham, because it had a better shot at being stronger than the film. Well, sometimes the film is better....  The film really centers on Bobby and Jonathan. The book includes all of the main characters as narrators and has an overlapping narrative structure. Because of this, the book fleshes out the female characters better and we see why Jonathan's mother was cast with Cissy Spacek rather than someone who seemed Midwestern and why Jonathan's father was so remote. Bobby's character has more sides, although the result is that he is less vivid than Colin Ferrell's portrayal. The three-dimensionality in the book is probably more realistic, but the film version of Bobby captures better that which is important--his odd mix of emotional distance, engagement, adaptability and ambiability. Beyond his sexual orientation, Jonathan doesn't emerge very strongly in either medium.  The book oddly does worse in setting the time and place than the film. I grew-up in the Cleveland of the 60s and 70s and made many trips to New York in the 80s. Neither place fares well in the book. Cleveland was in approaching its nadir--an unhip place beginning a long economic decline, yet also a place with vibrant music scene (that attracted many future "names" for their early tours), racial tension, and the residue of various European ethnic cultures and rivalries---in other words, it had atmosphere and it was a good launching pad to go someplace more "hip". The book protrays a generic place that is more like the inland, second or third string cities of the Midwest--places like Columbus or Fort Wayne that are big on Babbitry and bragging about their chain restaurants. New York also seems oddly unlike itself. The New York of the book's era was filled with menace--crime, fear of crime, grafitti-filled subways, filth, and a general sense of dysfunction, as well as the kind of energy, vitality, and avant garde spirit that have always drawn people to the City. The book could have taken place in the tiny bohemian quarter of Atlanta or some other provincial backwater, for all it matters. The gay world of the book's time also is lacking--it takes place at beginning of the age of AIDS and the end of libertine gay liberation. Yet, talk of AIDS is muted beyond the early denial of its presence and Jonathan has to be most sexless gay man in queer lit. Popular music plays a big role in the book, but Cunningham seems to have drawn a random selection from hits lists of the 70s, rather than combinations of music that fit in time or that would have appealed to a common audience. Although Cunningham grew-up in this era, he clearly participated rather little in the popular culture of it.  The story proceeds like the movie, with the addition of Erich, Jonathan's  bartender "boyfriend" (the relationship is undefined and mysterious to both of them). Toward the end of the book, Erich seems to be more of a plot device than a real person. The other characters take care of him as he convalesces, but with an odd lack of commitment.   Few films or books are made about menage a trois relationships and fewer films ask us to buy Collin Ferrell as a twentysomething virgin. Yet, the book came off as something far less than the film. The odd semi-sexual bond between Bobby and Jonathan was believable in the film but not in the book. Cissy Spacek took a truncated script and a thankless role in the film and communicated more about the mother's story than what we get in the book, despite the greater backstory. The film does better without Erich and without the coyness about Jonathan's HIV status. I wish I could have given the book as many stars as most of the other reviews, but by the time I finished, I just was glad that the story had ended 
 Like several of the other reviewers I initially enjoyed the book and felt comfortable that the stories were coming from a credible reliable source. Unfortunately the further I got into the book the more errors and implausible scenrios that came up the more I felt like I might be reading something that was 50% fiction. What a shame - once the book lost its credability I quickly lost interest and skim read a lot of pages. If I want to read made up stories about directors I'll just do it myself. As a New Zealander the worst offense for me was when she said that Peter Jackson is an AUSTRALIAN! Thats about the same as me saying that Speilberg is Canadian - hey, the countries are right next to each other so who cares. The book then stated that somebody landed at Auckland airport and promptly hired a car to drive 800 miles to Wellington to talk to Peter Jackson...thats very dramatic but very odd - most people would have walked the 5 minutes to the domestic terminal and flown to Wellington which takes about an hour.  This book rates about the same as an E-Hollywood true story which is all the more shameful if the author really did do as much research as she claims 
 I saw the movie and liked the songs in it.  I ordered the soundtrack from the movie, but it was not the soundtrack.  They have a dubbed another person in on Ike's part.  All the songs from the movie were not on the soundtrack and some other of Tina's were included.  I feel that if it is going to be advertised as a soundtrack then it should be a true soundtrack.  I was disappointed.  
 There is much wisdom to be gained from Aboriginal culture, but the "wisdom" in this book is NOT Aboriginal, but rather made up by the author.  She should have based her book on real Aborigines and shared their true culture, or based it on a totally fictional population.  That way readers would not believe the lies she tells about Australia.  The book does make one think about the many flaws of our western culture which is good, but to do so while corrupting a native culture is simply appalling.  She should not be profiting from this book 
 If you have read "Reunion" or "Einstein's Dreams", you'll be quite upset with this novel.    It seems rather limited in its scope, and is lacking metaphor like Lightman's other works.  He has developed as a writer since this book, however.  Don't let this one discourage you from exploring his other wonderful novels.  
 I bought this book based on reading others' reviews of how great it was, how the author's storyteling "pulls you in from the start & never lets you go." Others gave the impression that it was helpful to those going through a difficult time. I have to say - I don't get it. It was very short (I read it in less than an hour) and kind of pointless. The basic point of the story is that God is a mystery, and we don't always know why he lets certain events happen. Yeah, I get it already. Have since I was little. I can't believe I spent $10 for this book.  
 Ignore the unique cover, clever song idea( there is 30) which represent a comic book. Ignore all that. It simply is not good. What is this? I dont even know how to describe this music. It's not even songs, but more a bunch of really short experimental, non-sensequel, inerworkings of annoyance. They will start off with a riff as if they are going on to a song, but its only a tease, until they stop and go slow, to say," get on with it!!!!!!!!" Add a bunch of zany sound effects, not to mention the recurring anoyance of a high pitched voice ringing out, sci-fi clips and completly hoarse vocals that are screams, and sounds,that add up,to one of the most pointless albums ever put out 
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 It is the year 2005. The 21st Century. We've put men on the moon. We've launched space probes to the edges of our solar system. We can even remotely drive little vehicles along the surfaces of other planets.  But we can't design a simply on/off button.  The on/off button for the Blue Logger is one of the most insanely stupid things I've ever encountered. Some mentally-challenged engineer somewhere decided that you have to hold the button 2-4 seconds to turn it on, and 2-4 seconds to turn it off.  It doesn't *sound* that difficult to do, but in practice it is infuriating, especially when you are trying to turn it on but end up turning it off. Right now the Blue Logger is sitting in front of me and I cannot turn it off. It simply will not turn off.  Oh, and I've had lots of problems connecting it to my Bluetooth adapter, and have yet to get Street Atlas USA 2005 to recognize it 
 I am a huge fan of the RPG genre and have played just about every one for the PC.  Morrowind is the most boring one I have ever played.  I turned it off after two evenings of SLOWLY walking around, having stupid repetitive conversations with NPCs, and lamely fighting rats.  The interface is terrible.  You are very limited in what you can carry, so after you kill a monster you can't even carry your treasure back to town.  This "game" was all work with no fun.  Do not buy 
 It is always amusing for me to come across yet another attempt at 'Rewriting Koresh History'. The author conveniently overlooks THE FACT that David Koresh used women and innocent children as 'Human Shields' from the proper authorities. He also neglects to mention that keeping children locked up for 51 days without any decent food, running water , heat or electricity was CHILD ABUSE on a Grand Scale.I also thought his profile of Marc Breault was most misleading when Mr. Beault accomplished more in saving Koresh's followers than anybody else involved in this scenario. I do believe that this book should be sold in the 'Fiction 'section of any bookstore 
 ....while they keep selling more and more CDs.  I don't get it!  Their first CD was by far their best with each successive one giving us less and less.  The songs on this CD are the worst yet.  Get back to basics and at least a little country (and no "Backwards" doesn't count) 
 I am stunned that a book like "Lightning" would sell even one copy.  Mine was given to me, but should have been tossed in the trash instead.  I cannot begin to talk about what is wrong with this book because there is nothing right. Worthless!!!!and pathetic and beyond.  For heaven sake if you are really of fan of Steel's (I find that hard to believe) than check it out of the library, do not waste a dime on this trash. "Lightning" discredits all women and is a sham.  It does not deserve even one star 
 It is exactly this kind of short term mentality in this book, looking on all other countries as enemies instead of friends, that has been isolating the US from the rest of the world. Talking about military intelligence expense and power, no country beats the US 
 50 Cent is not good. Hes not at all talented and hes even worse live. This DVD sucks 
  . . . and more nonsense.  Like I've stated in previous reviews, the only reason I read any of this c**p is because as a professional Christian educator and theologian, questions about stuff like this come up far more often than I would like -- and I've gotta have my ammo ready.  Here we go again:  Dispensational pre-millinalism, which is the theology presented in the book as "authentic" Christianity, was invented out of whole cloth in the mid 19th century.  This is not the faith of the Apostles.  This is not the faith of the Early Church (East or West).  This is not the faith of the Reformers.  Luther and Calvin would have rejected this.  This is not the faith of the Great Awakening.  Wesley and Whitfield would have rejected this.  Even in Protestantism, this represents a minority "out there" viewpoint.  A non-Christian who picks up one of these books and believes that it represents mainstream Christianity will be grossly deceived.  This is not honest theology; this is not honest biblical interpretation; and the writing is horrible to boot 
 A rambling, boring plot; major characters that aren't remotely plausible; potentially interesting characters that make a brief appearance only to be killed off; major plot elements that aren't really resolved - all this and more in what must be one of the most poorly written books I've read in the last decade.  Don't waste your time on this stinker 
 I have never read anything that resembled utter junk than this. I must congratulate the author on his esoteric-convoluted writing style, because it has made understanding the concepts that much more difficult.   This book has absolutely no merit what so ever. In fact, this book is so bad, I will burn my book rather then selling it to fool some other prospecting buyer into thinking this is a good book.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!!! 
 I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.  Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.  The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.  By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
 As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is full of scientific and musical inaccuracies. Campbell's research methods are shoddy, and he has spent much of his career publishing irreplicable results.  Don Campbell is not a board-certified music therapist, nor does he even remotely have the equivalent training. While listening to music indeed has benefits, this has nothing to do with music therapy.   Music therapy involves a highly trained therapist working in person with a client, using music (usually live, often improvised, and usually created by client and therapist together) to work on client-specific goals. These goals do not ever involve "making a child smarter," and this does not ever involve using a CD that was "prescribed" without having met with and assessed the client.  The actual field of music therapy has published reserach showing that listening to a variety of music is good for intellectual and emotional development. This does not require any specific music selected by any experts. This just involves going to performances and/or getting CDs from the library.  Participating in interactive social music-making, such as community drumming circles, or parent-child play with instruments or improvised instruments has also been shown to be good for child development. Structured music lessons are also good for child development in different ways. All of this has been demonstrated over and over again by research.  Instead of buying this book, I suggest reading a music therapy textbook or speaking with a music therapist in order to learn about music therapy, and listening to recordings and participating in music-making in order to reap the benefits of music 
 Oh my - where did this young lady learn to sing? It's not music from an "old soul", as another reviewer put it - just bad singing. Ugg. Stay away from this one 
 While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as "special" or "crippled," I would never recommend it, because of the title,  which is bad as "The Nig**er Lamb" would be. Get it?  I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called "crippled" and terms like "special" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause  children to be perceived even more as "special" instead of different but equal 
 The writing is equally beautiful to Ahab's Wife, but the story seems to be begging for a plot triangle.  It's hard to understand why Naslund would have let this be published in such raw form. Characters make brief appearances and then disappear for pages.  Chapters read almost like separate vingettes.  Makes me wonder if publishers were pushing Naslud to meet a printing date: It is so peculiarly inferior to her other story, and odd when, clearly, her writing standards are so very, very high 
 This sophomore collection holds no comparison to the more influential Nuggets collections-- Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968; or Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond. Those two box sets highlighted some unknown and early punk and pop rock influences and proved as influential as Harry Smith's folk collection. Not so here. I counted about an 1/8th of the songs decent, but have to ask how often will you return to these novelties? Not much 
 Scientific? I couldn't get more disgusted.  This review is written because it can accomplish much, that is, let no one science-interrested person fall in this trap.  I did never read more than 20% of the book, that is a short one, I can only guess that its because there would been to much nonsens even for the most naive readers. I read until I had heard to much about the "revoloutionating discovery" (that you have not heard of in serious papers as Nature or New Scientist, why?)  This revaloutionary discovery etc. was a machine build by someone, that claims it could measure feelings, so for example it could measure in a black room when there was a big group of people feeling the same thing, maybe an OS contestant from USA (where the machine would be) winning the championship in whatever.  Well, then it was tested in superbowl but failed, the author explains this due to commecials distorting the feelings the public felt etc...  How would this machine be able to notice somethings like this? Well they must have checked out a list of "strange" topics from physics and chosen zero point energy that has to do with the vacuum. They could not choose something like electromagnetism, because that might be disregared right away by the public who might know to much about it.  Claims that the machine is working is based on odds for it not to be this way were apperently about 1:1000 (I don't doubt that more than 1000 of these experiments have been made and failed) The author also claims that there was a scientific explaination with the feeling an moon astronaut felt when he was away from earth, he felt connected to earth in some kind of way.  I laugh in disgust, noticing this book is nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to others that actually stand out as great books, giving you an "WOOOW!" but with a scientificually accepted material as background. Examples of these are:  QED: The strange theory of light and matter by Richard Feynman, who was one of three to individually invent Quantum Electro Dynamics, that is the most fundamental description of Electromagnetism. This book is based on a series of lectures Feynman made in University of Auckland, New Zeeland, to a PUBLIC audience.  Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics by Bruce A. Schumm. A book staying focused on the subject that lies around particle physics, a Wooow! I got from this book was the connections between the mathematical Lee Groups and the quantum forces of nature (electromagnetism, the weak force, the strong force), discribed greatly on a non professional level 
 Writing and story were not characteristic of Grisham.  He seemed to write as if his readers could not remember what was just said in a previous paragraph.  Very preachy about the plight of the homeless.  I am giving it two stars because I could actually finish reading it, but I do not recommend this book at all 
 I'm a big fan of The Sopranos so obviously the F word doesn't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the F word and MF. The stories and characters are superficial, boring and unintelligent.    People who like this show are the same people who think that what makes The Sopranos a great show is because people get "whacked" a lot.  
 I've read great reviews about this book so I finally bought it because I could not get it at my local library. Never ever finished the book - it was god-awful. Badly written, incoherent story - it jumped around - JUST PLAIN BAD.. 
 While Black and Blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse, it is rather difficult to identify with, like, or even feel anything for the protagonist.    Black and Blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband.  First of all, the book seems to me like a Lifetime Movie, almost cheesy if you will.  Half of the things the main character does, you are screaming at her in your head to not do them.  She is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie, who runs up the stairs instead of out the door.    I found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist.  While I was rooting for her, it was because she was the victim, not because I actually liked or understood her.  She seemed weak, in that she really didn't do much of anything to help herself or her situation, either everyone else did everything for her, or things just kind of happened. Yes, it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband, however, that was the only thing she ever really did for herself (pick up the phone).  Everything else was done for her, mostly without her knowledge.  She was doing something that was so hard to do, she should have felt like a strong woman to me, but she didn't not in the least and I attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non-actions of the main character.   One thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks.  While they were integral to the story, they came at the oddest moments.  Sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else, if it was actually happening in real time, or it was all in her head.  In the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a 2 or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation.  This left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real-time conversation was even about.    Overall, the basics of the plot were interesting, as were some of the characters in the book.  The book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse; however, it was not captivating.  I will not buy, recommend or read this book again. 
 This text is an easy read, and you will understand the reactions that are given in the text examples. So why the low rating? Organic chemistry is all about "prediction". And when it comes to teaching you how to predict the outcomes of reactions you've never seen before, it is lacking! You can study this text two hours a day, every day, and unless you have an uncanny ability to understand chemistry (I don't)--you will still not have this most fundamental skill you need to succeed.  Try "Organic Chemistry as a Second Language" and "Organic Chemistry II as a Second Language".  They will have you predicting and understanding Orgo in no time!! This course isn't hard at all- once someone explains it to you properly. David Klein (the author of those two books) does that beautifully 
 Sounds like it should be in a Meg Ryan romantic comedy.  Did they intentionally try to erase his personality? Sounds like it was produced in Nashville!  This should be a demo for another singer to record.  It's just too schmaltzy for me.  I think Phil Ramone may be slipping too.  Billy is a much better singer than this.  After listening to this song I instinctively lit a match.  I'm going to go listen to Glass Houses 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 Why can't the author get it right ?  The Marines of 1/8 fought with bravery, skill, and courage. Why can't the author take the time and effort to get his facts right, or get the names right ? Surely in his effort to quickly get a book on Fallujah on the market, he can take the extra time to do as good a job in his writing as did the Marines in their fighting. There are some excellent books coming out now about Fallujah; this is not one of them 
 With so many serious perspectives available on "peak oil", there is no reason to waste time on this screed, which only uses peak oil as a platform to cast aspersions on everything the author hates (and he hates, of course, all that which he does not understand).  He hates: the American south and its culture, Wal-Mart, interstates, strip malls, the Arab nations, and most of all, suburbs and the people who live in them. He loves: Israel, the liberal Northeast as it was fifty years ago, Israel, hateful rants, and Israel.  Peak oil lets him indulge in wishful thinking about how the Arab states will lose their power along with their oil, how the suburbs and Wal-Mart will collapse without cheap motoring, and the greatest reach of all: how the South and West will, for some reason, suffer more than the northern tier states in an energy scarce environment that he is certain is inevitable. Despite the fact that it is the northern tier states that are most dependent on cheap natural gas and heating oil, and have the least access to alternatives: solar, wind, biofuels. This last is thus little more than a transparent rationalization that allows him to imagine the reversal of the loss of economic and political clout of the north due to the inexorable flow of the American population from the dying Rust Belt cities to the more pleasant climes of the suburbs and the south.  Of course, he said all the same things before he ever heard of peak oil; back then he was making the same arguments about how Y2K was going to destroy all those things he despises. As were a lot of the other peak oilers.  Everywhere Kunstler goes, he sees only ugliness. This is to be expected. The ugliness lies within him, so he will never escape it.   Give this one a wide berth and learn something about Austrian economics. You'll be glad you did 
 I completely disagree that eating a diet rich in a lot of fat and protein through animal sources is the healthiest diet.  While following the recipes and outline of the book would be a better choice than the standard processed "fast food" diet of today, it is not at all superior to a plant based diet.  The China Study is an excellent and thorough book detailing years and years of research on how a high protein and high fat animal diet directly correlates to many diseases and ailments.  While I agree with the author's premise that refined, processed and packaged foods are substandard, I also disagree that ANY kind of oil or pure fat is not health promoting (she encourages the use of butter, coconut and olive oil).  All oils are processed foods, but even if they are cold pressed they are still a refined PURE fat.    Appropriate fats occur naturally in ALL fruits and vegetables.   Too much fat floating around in the blood stream will inhibit many body processes.   It also can be a recipe for disaster for those with sugar-related problems, as fat in the blood stream mixed with natural plant sugars (in fruit) can slow down in the digestion process, causing sugars to harmfully rise and contribute to candida or diabetes, for those who have weaknesses in those areas.  Many individuals with hereditary problems between high cholesterol and heart attacks should take caution with eating more cholesterol.  Why put more cholesterol in a body that already overproduces?   My personal experience of having my own father and many relatives with my same genetic problem drop dead from heart attacks made me really take control of my own health.   I have dropped my own levels by over 100 points on a high-raw, low-fat plant based diet, without the use of dangerous statin drugs.     So, although many cholesterol issues are dietary based, there are those with special circumstances that the author failed to address, who would not do well at all on her diet.   It would be a dangerous prescription to give someone, with possible arterial damage or even heart disease, a high protein and high fat animal diet.  There are very little recipes for fresh, raw plant food, and even the recipes such as salads contain dressings rich with animal products.   Most of the other plant based recipes are cooked in butter or egg bases. Many of the recipes are fried in butter or olive oil.  Fresh food is the healthiest food on the planet.   Cooked food, plant or animal based has been denatured so you are not getting the full structure of the nutrient that your body needs.   
 I am truely grateful for this feedback forum!  One has to read very carefully to ascertain that this DVD only contains a FEW of these two fine series.  AND at such a price!  I concur with many others that for the price, I expected to receive BOTH series - COMPLETE.  It seems that Disney offered one thing and delivered another!  The ol' bait and switch scam 
 I asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year - she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter (2 yrs old at the time). She bought the two bikes at the same time, same model, same color, same store. My daughter, who is far more coordinated then my nephew, tips over very easy, my nephew seems to do fine. My daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies. Perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily. Not sure - but I know I regret that she ever got the bike -it was a total waste of money 
 I was pleased with the orginal edition of The Secret World of 007 and felt this was worth getting for the updates. But to say this book has been updated with Die Another Day "and Casino Royale" is deceptive. The Die Another Day section is nice and complete, but the Casino Royale section is only 2 pages and not even presented in the same style as the other sections -- no "mission to Madagascar" or anything. Just a large pic of Craig and the Aston Martin spread across both pages and the film title (and a few smaller pics -- all of which we've seen). I was expecting cutaways of the casino and Venice house, etc. Nothing. So this book is updated with Die Another Day. That's all. Factor this into your decision to buy 
 This is disappointing cd. maybe 2-3 songs here are ok , but the rest is anything but ok. i really don't know what happened to them since their last album "Northern Light". that was a great cd , but the current just isn't good enough . from this band i've expected a lot more than this false release. believe me - you do not wanna spend money on this one 
 This is at least one book too many for Peter.  Most of the stories are old and too many involve farts.  If you find this funny, your sense of humor has not developed since the second grade.  The book is full of errors.  Peter tells how Riviera is one of his favorite courses and then tells about his hole-in-one on the 15th hole. Sorry, Peter but the 15th hole is a par four.  You made your ace on the 14th hole.  It is evident that Peter not only did not write the book, he didn't even read it.     
 As an introduction Zen, what has been presented in this book is fine though it could have been done with lot less elitist overtone. I agree Zen and its true comprehension does not come easy (I am talking of regular mortals such as myself here) and words as mere symbols for concepts are distorting when conveying Zen.   I do not propose that I am an expert on Zen or even Buddhism in general but I have read a few books on Buddhism by Thich Nhat Hanh, Dalai Lama, Chogyam Trungpa and others. Though an agnostic who does not care for much for organized religion, I do believe the most fundamental benefit of any spiritual/ religious framework is to instill a sense of compassion toward other beings. You need some kind of cultural creation (religious or otherwise) to counter act the natural tendency of a human to be self-serving. In this aspect, I have high regards for non-theistic Buddhism and the inclusiveness of Vedanta (Hinduism) that proposes all religions eventually lead to the same attainment. From this viewpoint I was surprised with this author.  This author may have been one of the leading authorities on Zen in his time, but unfortunately he comes as an arrogant, elitist, full of prejudices. He does not miss any opportunity to put down other religions or even other sects of Buddhism. Only Zen as practiced by the Rinzai sect is pure, strong and generally worthy of pursuit. Any form of spiritualism from the West is of course hopeless since the western mind cannot escape the conditioning of logical thinking.  Any spiritualism from India is complex, ceremonial and not practical. Other sects of Buddhism generally do not have true comprehension, lost their way focusing on non-essentials etc. He reserves his most disparaging remarks for Indian religions and monks (and does his best to show that though Buddhism originated in India, it is really the Chinese and Japanese due to their practical nature made something of it).  Is this just the standard fundamentalism/ misplaced racism?  I will definitely read other books on Zen and go beyond this author. 
 Not everyone will agree with me (I'm sure), but based on my own being a fifty-something male who is fighting Father Time as part of my never-ending quest to stay reasonably fit, I think that any book that purports to cover the subject of "fitness over fifty" needs to address the realities of what happens to the human body as it ages.  This requires more than a trivial reference to a few measurements of physical decline, including percentage loss of "VO2 max," it demands frank and full  discussion of what it actually means to be aging and yet trying to remain athletically active.    Here's the deal, like it or not: as we get older, we get more brittle, less flexible, more prone to gaining weight, and more prone to injuries, which in turn take longer to heal.  And on and on.  Consequently, it becomes increasingly important to be smart, prudent, and strategic in the way one approaches physical activities.    A good book on this topic would devote a great deal of its contents to these realities of aging, and would serve as a guide to avoiding injury, dealing with various kinds of soreness and other age-related physical issues, and addressing the *psychological* issues related to the realization that one's body no longer can do what once it did.    Instead, this book is, for the most part, just another general treatise on "beginning exercise," with but a very few comments that might be helpful to 50+ people in particular.  In fact, the first part of the book is actually counter-productive, in my opinion, as its message is essentially the old "inspirational" saw about how "age is only a number," etc.  Folks, this isn't true, and even the best-trained athletes over fifty years old will confess as much.    Most of the book is a slog through "how to begin" various sports, including running, swimming, cycling, and cross-country skiing.  This information may be useful for people who absolutely have never done any serious exercise, but these sections are addressed to a general audience, with practically no information that is of particular use to an "over fifty."    With so many people who have exercised one way or another getting older, there remains a crying need for a book that actually addresses the issues that aging athletes will encounter as the years go by.  As the old saying goes, aging isn't for cowards, it's a tough process that has to be addressed head-on, not sugar-coated and pep-talked out of existence.    
 Donot buy it. I got the stuff even past the expiration day 
 This book is only an overview of topics, none of the topics are discussed in detail, so if you just depend on this one book to pass the exam, it is not going to work. The sample problems and other topics make assumptions  without reference to where they came from. As long as you have other texts  or good notes from your courses, this book is O 
 One of the authors of this book is Mr. Philip Watts, chairman of Shell until 2003. He left the company after it was revealed that under his mandate, Shell has inflated its oil reserves by 20%, with his knowledge and influence. Although the book seems consistent and based on real facts, his presence as an author make it a bit unreliable. I did not realize he is one of the authors. If I  knew it, I would never buy it. Check "Chapter 2 - The Right Framework",  particulalrly the item "Transparency and Accountability" and then check the reports on Mr Watts' activities and behaviour at Shell.      How can one trust on what reads?? 
 I enjoyed and learned a lot from both of Tanenbaum's OS textbooks, but this is really awful. On the one hand, the descriptions of things such as RPC are so abstract that I can't see how anyone could be expected to understand what a real RPC system would look like; on the other hand, there's not nearly enough effort made to give a picture of how the systems discussed fit into the broader context of computer science, or relate to each other.  Moreover, the book is badly written: the writing is alternately overly colloquial and overly academic in style, as if it were written by someone very smart, but for whom English is a second language 
 There are reasons not to allow politicians to write - this book is proof in point.    Jaswant has many ideas but the presentation is addled.  He tries to make one or two basic points in each section - but he digresses too much, randomly jumps around in history to prove his point, and tries to include too much information.  Also, the editors have done a horrible job - Jaswant has a peculiar way of saying things that is often both grammatically incorrect and hard to understand.  The editors seem to have run spellcheck on the book and let it by.  When the best reason to read a book is because of who is writing it and not because of what it contains, it can't be too great a book.  Jaswant is typically understated, apologetic, and slightly biased.    Ideally, he should have teamed up with a good writer/journalist to write this book.  In its present form, it is a painful read.  The two or three basic concepts/ideas it puts forth could have been conveyed in a far more concise book.  Sadly, few alternatives are on the market.  
 Adams is either a liar or too gullible to be allowed in public without his nanny. The most laughable mistake of "Next World War" is Adams' story of a printer virus supposedly used in the first Gulf War. He got the story from an April's Fool joke printed in InfoWorld magazine. Duh! For a detailed analysis of the wildly false stories of this book, complete with references, see http://www.soci.niu.edu/~crypt/other/adams.ht 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 Had all the makings of a great book, but the analysis is shallow and very unbalanced. Unfortunately, like some of the activist movements it discusses, the book makes a passionate presentation of serious problems that should be addressed, but fails to propose viable and practicable solutions to these issues 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 I think that this price is absolutely ridiculous! People dont buy these items for that ridiculous price, they are $3.25 at Walmart and Target. These toys are hard to find at Walmart and Target, but its because these sellers are taking them off the shelfs to rip people off in these sites. If the demand is high they will continue to rip people off. Don't buy from these sellers, and you will begin to find them at your local stores!!!! 
 I thought I'd be nice in giving film two stars even though it pretty much deserves none at all. I wasn't old enough at the time, but I'm sure fans were slightly bemused at the re-emergence of Friday the 13th.  Tommy, now a teenager (and a bloody old one at that) is residing at the local mental institution still traumatised by the terror of Jason and also the death of his mother.  Tommy is plagued by dreams and nightmares convinced that Jason is back from the dead.  And it seems he may be right, when a series of murders begins. But who could it possibly be THIS time. Jason is dead, isn't he? It's up to Tommy to fight his demons once again and get to the bottom of things before he himself becomes the victim of Jason Voorhees? Friday the 13th Part 5 is a perfect example of how sequels in horror can ruin what went before.  The body count in this is ridiculously high and the gore itself leaves a lot to be desired.  Was it really necessary? Is too much, too much? The only ounce of credibility in this film is Harry Manfredini's reprisal musical score.  Other than that, you'd be forgiven for skipping this Friday the 13th entry 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 I bought this unit because the humidity in my apartment on extremely dry days and nights was 15-20%.  The Air-O-Swiss 7135 was rated top by every web site I visisted and researced before buying this product.  It is also rated to work in rooms up to 600 square feet, and the biggest room in my apartment is less than 500.  Well to summerize: - hygrostat consistently says 25% even though my bedside hygo says 15%.  The best I can get out of this machine is 30% humidity according to my own hygostat, as the one built into the unit does not move past 25%. -  the above situation is in the smallest room in my home, which is 170 square feet, so the 600 square feet rating is totally not true.  To close, please be ware that this unit does not work for extremely dry apartments and homes like mine.  The other reviews must be in homes that are already at 30-40% humidity.  This is not worth the money you pay for it.  I will try running it non-stop for a few days to see if it helps, but if not then this unti will be going back.  
 Mailer tells us a lot we don't want to know about. It's the gloomy long tale of an egocentric writer's acceptance of the ups and downs of his metier. He gives his biased opinions on things he knows and things he doesn't know about. All the negative aspects of his persona are laid out. Still, it must have taken some bravery to lay out some of them. Or else he needed the money. Truth sells, even if it is a very mediocre unfocused book, and quite un-useful. It should have been titled "Me and My Books, Some thoughts on me and my writing" 
 The Title of this CD threw me off; the description and the first review didn't help either.  The primary reason for buying this CD was the song "You Are My Sister", but this version is a duet with someone that can't sing. I can't tell which CD has a version of the song as seen on Letterman. Disappointing 
 I bought this cookbook thinking it was persian cooking.  I certainly did not expect to see recipes for Italian dishes and dumbed down american dishes.  I wouldn't even say these are recipes - things like dumping a can of cream of mushroom soup with other things is not cooking in my mind.  This is neither persian cooking or american cooking - it's a disgrace to people who enjoy the art of either.  I'm returning the book.  I'd give this 0 stars, but unfortunately, Amazon doesn't have that option 
 Will somebody please tell me where I can get the long version of Slow Ride - the entire reason I bought this album in the first place???!! 
 The songs by Usher and Stevie Wonder are the only two decent tracks on here. Everything else is just whatever. Janet Jackson's song "Again" isn't even on here 
 First, the good news:  1. I lost 8 pounds in two weeks on this diet, even with the occasional skim latte and granola bar.  2. Following it wasn't logistically impossible, as some have complained. Even as very busy grad students, my roommate and I were able to stick to it by making meals in advance and marking off on a daily list the things we were supposed to eat or drink throughout the day.  3. I really liked the cranberry water, and still make it when cranberries are in season. I'm not much of a water drinker, but enjoy guzzling the cranberry water, so it helps me stay hydrated and cleansed.  Now the bad news: 1. I gained back all 8 pounds and more within the weeks following the diet, even though I eat little junk food. 2. No noticable reduction in cellulite while I was on the plan. 3. I frequently felt hungry or experienced cravings (hence the skim lattes and granola bars mentioned above). I was having fantasies of buying a loaf of crusty bread at my favorite bakery and tearing into it the minute I got into my car. Definitely not a good sign. 4. As with all diets, food and body became an obsession. Finally, two things that made this experience somewhat worthwhile: 1. I learned about cranberry water. 2. It brought me a step closer to leaving the insane world of dieting. That was three years ago. I'm not and don't ever expect to be a size 8 like I wanted at that time, but I have no regrets. 
 I can't believe that anyone would believe this nonsense! This is the kind of book that may be praised by homosexuals who are trying to convince us that perverted behavior is good instead of evil, but it belongs in the trash with the rest of the garbage 
 I was troubled at how Cynthia Rylant started each chapter with a scripture from the Bible, then completely misrepresented the contents of the Bible...and worse, God himself. If you are a Christian, please be cautious when reading this book or allowing your child to read it. It suggests to children: the Bible and the Koran are equal; that there is no hell; there is never a need for any type of repentence or change of heart in your life time; and God Almighty has little or no control of anything that happens here on earth. I strongly encourage anyone who claims the name of Jesus to leave this Cynthia Rylant book alone! For the last 5 years, I've read every Cynthia Rylant book I could get my hands on. I've sang her praises as a wonderful children's author. Most of her earlier books are so sweet and capture children's attention with her realism and charm. However, no matter how sweet and charming her books may seem, when misrepresenting the truth about God and eternity, then they are dangerous. 
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
 Had this model above for 5 years. Started skipping during playing any CD ..not scratched. My CX300 model is 8 years old, and works great. When you check the sony site for service, if not under warranty, it's about 195 bucks for an exchange, and 122 for service.    I sure would like to know what's the problem with these? Don't exchange! Buy a new one for about 220, and smash the old one....make sure you video it and post on YouTube 
 This was not the edition I wanted, as follows: I initially found the desired edition, including a photo of the cover, followed the links for available copies, including this one which I purchased (which, BTW, did not have a photo of cover, but I assumed it was same edition as on the initial page). Was dismayed to receive this different edition. It matters because it was for a friend's college course. Professors often reference pages in the assigned edition, which do not correspond to another edition's page numbering. Please minimize such confusion by more accurate advertising (include a cover photo on every linked page, to ensure it matches the initial one) or more accurate linking--i.e. don't show a specific search result but then link to other books that are not the same one, unless again, there are cover photos or other info displayed to distinguish them 
 After watching the movie which I enjoyed.  I bought the book thinking it would be just as good if not better.  Boy was I wrong, the book was horrible.  I could barely finish reading it.  This is one case where the movie is much better than the book 
 I picked this book up because it was on a book club's book list.  I actually had to go through InterLibrary Loan to get it since it wasn't available at my library.  After reading and forcing myself to finish it, I envision the head librarian at my branch shredding all copies to line hen cages, which would explain why a book club item wasn't available in a library.  Or perhaps the book club people had gone temporarily mad, who can say.  Many other reviewers have commented on the one-dimensional characters, the wooden pace, the absence of any attempt to sketch character motivation, but no one has mentioned the idiotic prose that flows, page after page, endless as the wine in Salim's cup.  "He looked down, and there was something sticking out from his belly.  It was a sword," is a paraphrased example of what you might find in this book, or with equal probability and more purpose, on an SNL skit.  This is a badly written book, if you had no interest in Mughal history, you will not have any interest in it after reading this book.  If you thought that was a wonderful period rich in complexity, you'd shred this book and line the hen cages too 
 Teri Hatcher fans can perhaps get some value for money.  But for her, and her ample body on ample display, this movie is just not worth the time.  Terrible direction, awful story, miserable music!! 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 This movie was a weak effort by Capra, who directed it, and the star, Gary Cooper. It's a good story, just poorly directed (Capra can't hit a home run every time). I found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on. And no extra features on the dvd, at least none to speak of 
 I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for a non-realistic cutsie book to pass the time.  The book starts with a good premise: what the elaborate ritual of college admissions really tells about a person and who he or she is.  However, the story gets lost with odd twists, turns, and irrelevant plot lines.  This poorly written maze of a book about nothing isn't exactly written for teens as it heavily focuses on the emotions of the stress of parents sending their children away.  There are some mildly amusing parts as Dylan goes through various college interviews.  However, most of these situations are cliché and predictable.  The more unintentional amusing parts of this book is watching the author, James Finney Boylan, attempt to create characters that talk like modern day teenagers.  Someone should tell this guy no one calls each other "dickweed" or "dude" in every sentence.  Another thing that is annoying is that he writes like he is still in junior high.  One may notice he shifts from the narrator talking in first person to third person at various points.  He also used convoluted vocabulary in an attempt to add some sort of depth to the writing.  So if you are really bored, there may be some humorous things in this book to read, mostly unintentional 
 This was not for dummies, I found it difficult to follow and to look up specific problems.  Did not care for this book. Not too helpfu 
 I really do congratulate Bill Rancic for being HIRED by one of the richest man in the world. But being hired does not mean that Bill Rancic just became the next Bill Gates or Warren Buffet.   Great to know that you take yourself VERY VERY highly Mr.Rancic. your going to fit fine in the Trump Organization, But seriously dont over do yourself.  I'd rather retake my 'X100 intro to business administration' class in my college than to buy this book 
 Nothing against these particular paddles, but avoid cheap paddles. If you splurge on any item in your kayak budget it should be the paddles. If you paddle, you will develop a close relationship with your paddles - it can either be a good one or a bad one. You can markedly improve your paddling experience with a relatively small increase in spending. Good paddles will make you want to use your kayak 
 In the 1960s, Andrew Greeley was often accused of never having had an unpublished thought. Following his inordinate number of novels, we can now add that he hasn't had an unpublished fantasy. This scattered and strangely dated book envisions a kind of fantasy revolution in an American Catholicism where lay people can be holier than priests (no kidding) even though most of them scoff at strictures against birth control and even abortion, where the biggest problem seems to be that someone removed the statues from the sanctuary of the parish church while failing to appreciate how movies like "Dogma" improve on 2,000 years of theological reflection. He seems to think it objectively true that guitar players are all terrible musicians (take THAT, Les Paul) while all organ players are virtuosos.  He has identified a class of Catholics called "liturgists," whose passionate aim is to strip worship of anything beautiful and everything ancient while replacing it with a pimply-faced folk singer thoroughly versed in his three guitar chords and three hundred heinous hymns which parishioners listen to because they are polite.  He does mention in passing that the new authoritarianism and dogmatism are having an effect but seems oblivious to the fact that those reactionary forces, the ones that elected our new Pope, are spiraling out of control as politicians are denied communion for upholding the law of the land and the priest-pedophile scandal is rapidly morphing into a combination cover-up and gay-bashing frenzy.  Greely is coming out with a book that purports to explain the mystery of the recent papal election. I hope his big issue is not the poor color coordination of Benedict XVI's liturgical vestments 
 Just recently purchased the Thermometer and the clip does not hold the theremometer in place.  Paid $6.50 for item and $6.34 for shipping and was very displeased/upset with quality of the item. I thought the clip would hold the thermometer in the upright position so you could move the frothing cup in circular motion.  Thermometer falls over due to clip not tight enough on thermometer shaft.  
 Is this the same Kool Keith that created Dr. Octagon, Dr. Dooom, and Black Elvis?  "Spankmaster" represents a regression of creative energy.  It sounds like Keith decided he wanted to make a record one morning and whimsically threw together some tracks.  It contains little of the genius of his earlier CDs.  With the exception of a couple songs ("jewelry shine" and "Blackula"), this album stinks 
 The first five minutes of the dvd was interesting; however, after that I found that I was forcing myself to watch it without a great deal of enjoyment 
 This was a below average graphic novel.  It did not do much for me 
 Readers should be aware that this study was first published  in 1953, and despite light revision reflects the state of scholarship half a century ago.  We've learned a LOT about the history of Christianity since then, and many of the sweeping assumptions of this book (e.g., in the ghastly section entitled "The Darkest Hours: The Great Recession, A.D. 500-950") have been thoroughly discredited.  The bibliographies for each section don't include works published in the past half century (despite the so-called revision).  Even the very language is dated, with its grandiose, sweeping style, capitalization of popes, etc.  This book perpetuates a great many old myths, making the job of historians of religion just that much harder.  There are now much better books on the market 
 Whatever happened to Hey Dude or Salute Your Shorts?  THOSE, for sure, should be on DVD.  Not the shows that are still on air 
 I SUBMITTED MY REVIEW TWICE! WHY IS IT NOT BEING PUBLISHED? PLEASE REPLY  
 Tolerance means accepting and no causing to conform to your beliefs. Which is what Muslims do. If Islam was not tolerant, then how are millions of muslims living in America today? How are they living in the same houses, going to American schools, listening to music, having to shop for clothes that are all inches of fabric, having to watch as kids in class make christmas cards in class or carve Halloween jack o lanterns, or not get to go to public swimming areas or Muslims teens not making out with teen guys? Islam makes no move to force anyone. Everyone is trying to confrom you. Everyone assumes that you do celebrate Christmas or eat pepporoni or wear shorts and tank tops. Because they think everyone should be like them and that's all. Sometimes it makes me tired and look back at how I've made it to high school as  Muslim, especially after 9/11. It comes from faith in God, my family, my friends- both Muslim and non-Muslims, and looking at all the good things and stringing those together and making those count more for the bad things. If only people coudl have that outlook on life, the world would not be such a bitter, criticizing place to be wher eeveryone has to constantly defend themselves. I can't seek to change everyone's opinion because it's not our place to tell people what's right and wrong. If you know about the true religion and Allah has opened your heart, it is up to him to let you accept Islam. In the end , if you keep good relations with others and have an open mind, understanding Islam and other religions, will not be a problem for you. And as assurance to other Muslims who are struggling and have become insecure about themselves around unwelcoming people,  " And had your lord so willed, He could surely have made all mankind one single community, but (He willed it otherwise, and so) they continue to have differences-all of the,, save those upon whom your Lord has bestowed HIs grace (by following His guidance on cohabiting with their differences and handling them peacefully). (11:118-119)  That is the simple message of Islam. Diversity is by God's will and it is useless to deabte against others that you are right and they are wrong or you are good and they are bad. Only God knows and that's how it is supposed to be. He will accept those people's prayers even those who aren't Muslims and are good people, we really don't know. No Muslim says if you're not Muslim, you go to Hell. That is completly out of line. ' Kaafir' does not mean infidel or unbeliever as many so called experts and uninformed people believe. It simply mean one who denies the clear fact of God's creation and favors and rejectss His message while realizing within oneself the truth that he/she opposes in words.  I think one of the main reasons people are against Islam and think it unfavorable, is becasue it is so different from our media and pop culture today. Islam to modern society is like an old fashioned time, whien people still read thier holy books, didn't have premarital sex, wore modest clothing, thought highly of educaiton, had good ties with their parents and family and respected their elders. Now in this free society, people want to do anything and can't stand those who have self control and such faith.  islam is easy to embrace if what your goal is , is to worship God in the simplest sense and keep good morals and values and be tolerant to others. Many religions also do this, so it shows islam is not some strange new idea.  thank you 
 I was ecstatic when I received this magazine subscription as as gift. Two issues into my subscription it stopped. I was really anticipating the December issue because I had many guests coming and could use some of Martha's helpful advice, however it never came and neither did January or February. I have called Martha Stewart Living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic, I still have not received another issue. When I asked to cancel for a refund I was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up - being that it was a gift this is useless. Very clever for Martha and very frustrating for the giftee/consumer 
 Most of the frugal tips in this book are really quite obvious to anyone with any financial sense.  There is nothing new or revolutionary about what the author is saying and most of her suggestions fall into the basic financial planning category.  She also repeats herself constantly.  The book could have been about half as long if she didn't rehash the same points over and over.  This is not a good book if you are serious about finding ways to save money.  The religious overtones throughout the book are a bit offensive, as well. 
 I have been reading this book aloud to fifth graders in a rural area, and I don't get it! I am very uncomfortable with the enthusiasm with which the book embraces violence as a staple of black family life. There is a chapter about a bully who does a "Maytag wash," scrubbing his smaller victims with snow and then flinging them against a chain link fence - apparently meant to be funny, but my audience of ten-year-olds just looked puzzled. In another chapter, the mother approaches naughty brother Byron with matches, Vaseline and bandages, intent upon burning his fingers as punishment. Fortunately, sister Joetta blows out the matches - also meant to be funny, I guess, but it is difficult for me to see the humor in child abuse. I might concede that this book is a valuable illustration of a particular time in history, but the Birmingham experience is overshadowed by the portrayal of African Americans as stupid and scary . . . not the lesson I had hoped for. 
 Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly" 
 What dooms "A Son Called Gabriel" is a combination or too much ambiguity at the end and too little focus throughout.  By the unsatisfying end, I never felt any connection to the book or to the relatively flat characters.  It might just be that I've read far better books on the subject of a young man grappling with his sexual identity.  I agree with another reviewer who remarked this entire book could have been condensed into a Part I with a Part II and possibly Part III that get to the meatier times in Gabriel's life after he leaves for college.  That Gabriel plays with girls and dolls and wants to be a hairdresser at 7-9 is interesting--albeit stereotypical--but doesn't warrant 100 pages of development.  The early teen years also don't add a lot.  Really nothing gets moving in this story until Gabriel's 16-18 or so and by then it was almost over.  There's a lot of lip service given to the Catholic-Protestant "Troubles" in the 60s, 70s, but it's never clear how any of this really affects Gabriel's development.  Since he's boyfriend to a Protestant girl, I'd have to say the political tensions didn't matter a whole lot to him.  In which case, it doesn't add much to the story.  At the end of course there's the big Scarlet Letter/Empire Strikes Back twist, which only distracts readers from the fact that the ending raises more questions than it answers.  What will happen to Gabriel in London?  Will he and Fiona stay together?  Was Father Brendan a homosexual?  We'll never know unless there's a sequel in the works.  As for the writing, it was average.  I thought the author was guilty of run-on sentences at a few points, but that's just me.  There wasn't enough scene-setting.  Instead, we get a lot of rushing through test preparations/results and repetitive encounters with school bullies.  As a result of all the rushing around, there wasn't time to really develop the characters.  The rest of Gabriel's family isn't much different than any sitcom family because there wasn't time to really settle in and flesh out their personalities into more than one dimension.  But as I said at the beginning, my lack of enthusiasm might be because I've read better books on the subject.  "A Home at the End of the World" by Michael Cunningham, "Kavalier and Clay" by Michael Chabon, and "Line of Beauty" by Alan Hollinghurst top that list, the latter two winning the Pulitzer and Booker Prize respectively.  By comparison, "A Son Called Gabriel" isn't in the same weight class 
 Celine Dion is the bomb. How like the bomb in this.  DVF is the bomb. Celine hee!  Was this review helpful to you?  Well 
 Yes, this book was a present from my father in law. He knew about my interest in digital photography and bought this book in Japan for me.   What to say about this book..hmmm..each time I look at its size and compare it with the shallowness of its contents it makes my blood boil. Seems Mr. Rick Sammons wants to keep the real knowledge to himself and dish out only a small fraction of it to the readers.  I have learned much more from the internet and from second hand magazines than from this hefty book. His constant reference to plugins ticks one off as it seems he never wants the reader to know about photoshop's potential and the effects the program can create itself (don't know how much he was paid by nik color efex..his favorite plugin) A hobbyist would love to know how to make fabulous images and not what Professional photographers have shot, about rules of composition (not just rule of the 3rds), exposure, 18% gray, how different colors in nature can assist you take a guess about the correct exposure if u donot have a grey card, how u can use the palm of your hand to take a meter reading, the use of manual mode for night photography, etc. All such vital information was either not given the required emphasis or was avoided completely by Mr. Sammons.   This book is a waste of money. Though my father in law paid for it, I still feel sad. If only I knew what he was buying and what the book was like, I would have advised him otherwis 
 I read this book for three reasons - I love reading about the 40s and 50s, I thought it maybe entertaining and that I may gain some insight about the 'big break up'.  Instead, I learned how Jerry Lewis idolized Dean Martin's good looks and suave manners to the point of absurdity.  Jerry comes across as a passive-agressive oddball who was desperate for male companionship and acceptance.  He did business behind Dean's back, he manipulated Dean and those around him with his so-called good-hearted intentions. I also learned that he cannot write a book, even with a ghost writer onboard.  This book jumps around a lot and his thought patterns are hard to follow, as he never really gets to the point of anything he starts talking about. Dean appears to have been a long-suffering, emotionally drained partner in an unhealthy relationship. And after reading this book, I'm GLAD they split up. Poor Dino would have eventually cracked under the pressure of working with such a clingy, and needy person like Jerry (as any sane person would) if they had stayed together any longer.  Fun read for a study in abnormal relationships. 
 Denmark fancies himself a real tough guy because he grew up in the tough Brownsfield District and because he was named after slave revolt leader Denmark Vesey.  Okay.  Denmark is married to a ghost of a woman named Sierra.  She starts off as a ghost to the reader and is still a ghost at the end of the book.  Who was she?  What did she want?  What did she like?  How did she feel about being placed on a pedastal like some kind of plaster cast mannequin?  What did she think about the life she had in which she wasn't even a real woman - just some breathing fantasy come to life?  Denmark doesn't seem to know or care.  She cheats on him.  He gets real real mad. Why he is so mad about losing a woman that he doesn't even care to get to know is never made clear but he is real real mad.  So mad that he sets out to get revenge by sleeping with every woman he knows even if her man is one of his friends.  Things get ugly.  The only good thing about this book is that Sierra escapes her cage.  Hopefully she will find a real man 
 as a longtime fan of loggins and messina i have to admit that this record is the weakest of the lot. by the time this album came out, i am sure loggins and messina were working on diferent agenda's.  this is a tired album, no life and probably fulfilled their committment to columbia records.  i would prefer to think of the energy of loggins and messina on the first two albums of theirs.  don't get me wrong, their are some decent tracks on this album but nothing that rocks like vahevela or country song.    
 Once the software developers have de-bugged the Iriver interface with the Media player 11, it may well be an excellent device. Until such time, what you have is an FM player. When you try to play anything you have down-loaded , you will find yourself viewing the error message ' To play this track you must sync your device to your PC'. It's quite disappointing, so much promise; my rating, not ready for prime time 
 I usually get both the Lonely Planet and Rough Guides for my trips, and generally both are good. In this case there is no comparison, and I would recommend just getting the Rough Guide. It's 585 pages compared to Lonely Planet's slim 332 and contains much more detailed information. The fourth edition of the Rough Guide (May 2003) is even less expensive! And where Lonely Planet usually wins, in color photographs and maps, the Rough Guide has at least caught up. I do like Lonely Planet's giving phone code and population for each city/town/village, but that alone doesn't make it worth carrying around 
 Douglas Gresham's earlier work, "Lenten Lands," was a fine exploration of his life with C.S. Lewis and his mother Joy Davidman Gresham, and well worth the read for the insights it provided into Lewis' life and relationships.  So it was with positive anticipation that I recently purchased this his second book, and it was with dismay that I found little to no interesting new information about Lewis within its pages.    What's more, the book is written in an overly pedantic tone, almost as if it was written for children.  I can only assume that this was intentional on the part of the author because of the recent release of the Narnia film and Lewis' popularity with children.  But it's highly distracting, for example, to be told that during the second world war Germany was "overcome by an evil man" or that a prosecuting attourney is known as a "DA".  Over and over again Gresham explains the obvious and the effect on the reader is jarring, not to mention needlessly stultifying.   Still there are a handful of personal recollections of Lewis that will be of interest to Lewis scholars, particularly his discussion of what Lewis thought of his time in the army during WWI, the charitable aspects of his personality and a brief blurb about a novel that was never published.    That being said, this book is not a good place to start if you're coming at Lewis for the first time.  George Sayer's biography "Jack" is probably the best, and Gresham's own "Lenten Lands" would be a good follow-up, especially if you enjoyed Shadowlands (the movie or play).    In the final analysis, this book appears to be a half-hearted attempt to tie into the recent popularity of the film, which is unfortunate because clearly Gresham has a wealth of personal information and anecdotes at his disposal, and the requisite skill to write a book worthy of his subject, but he misses the mark here 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 It's really not a wonder to me why John Howard's records never "took off" or why the label dropped him.  Both of these discs sound like an artist struggling (read: trying too hard) to make a hit pop record...kind of like when Elton lost it around Rock of The Westies - except his band had the chops to lift the sub-par songs somewhat.  These are grand attempts at the piano-based, and occasionally camp, singer-songwriter (a la early Elton) genre but sadly this stuff is just plain mediochre.  The lyrics are blase and at times quite honestly embarrassing (i.e. "some good good loving"??).  I tried hard to like these records but the songs are just not quite there.  If you want to hear an early seventies lost jewel then turn to Bill Fay, NOT John Howard 
 However, Amazon does not allow zero star ratings...  I can't even dignify this by calling it a book. Isn't the beauty of Aesop's fables mainly in the brevity of them? Consider the amzing power of Jesus' ultra concise parables. Then take a look at this clunker. If you tried to tow the Queen Mary with a bungee cord, you could not stretch the bungee further than Johnson has stretched his parable in this book. If you actually enjoy this book and get something out of it, perhaps you should hunt up a copy of Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music."  This is the pet rock of literature here. We all wish we had come up with the idea and pocketed the cash. But genius it ain't. Just light your money on fire, if you need to get rid of some. That would be more fun than reading this book 
 I bought this to help with college after being out for 10yrs-almost impossible to install plus it does not allow you to make any adjustments if your professor wants it a certain way. Useless-buy the cheat sheet at barnes and noble 
 First of all this book has very little information about Faith the wonder dog which was dissappointing.  Secondly, I understand that this edition was a mistake which was obvious from the typos and grammatical errors.  All that aside, the author spends most of the book talking about her ex-husband and her custody battle with her children.  While reading the book, it was difficult for me to believe that everyone in the town could be against this woman (including the police and the Judge), and that every time she was fired or quit a job it was because her boss was doing something illegal or unethical.  After reading her ex-husband's comments on this website (under the 2nd Edition book reviews), I realize that the author appears to have serious mental and emotional issues.  I'm sure she probably had some hard times, but you cannot convince me that her ex-husband kidnapped and abused the children and the police, the neighbors, and the Judge in this small town did nothing about it.  She writes as if everyone in the entire town was against her.  If she was such a great mother and Dad was the "bad guy," you would think she could have found several "character" witnesses to testify in court to this end.  Consequently, if the neighbors whom she claims "saw" the step mother dragging her daughter by her hair, couldn't she have had them subpoenaed to give testimony about the abuse?  The claims she makes about the Judge and the police in custody case are not even believable.  She even states that the Judge forbade her to attend Law School.  If the Judge indeed made this claim, it was becaus she knew the author could not handle it emotionally.  If the Judge made all of the decisions in error that the author claims she did, then her attorney should have filed a Writ of Mandamus to recuse the Judge.  If the author's claims about the Judge's decisions were true, at the end of the custody case, the Judge would have been reviewed and consequently disbarred.  The author is someone who always sees herself as the "victim" so that she doesn't have to take responsibility for her actions.  In my opnion, nobody came to her aide (i.e., character witnesses) because everyone suspected she was not mentally stable.  Most of the positive reviews were probably written by her or her children.  I hope Faith has a happy life and the author does not simply use her for financial gain.  In my opnion, this woman needs years of therapy 
 While the information in the book about herbs is useful, there are better books available that don't make claims of being able to cure HCV. The author reprinted his lab results for blood tests and used his liver enzyme levels as proof. However he did not show us his viral load and antibody test results which is what actually determines the presence of the virus. From experience I know that the herbs this author recommends do help the liver to function better as I have been able to get my enzyme levels back into the normal range with the same herbs, however I still have the HCV antibodies and a high viral load. I am not cured. I might be compelled to try the author's high-priced frozen vials of magic if I saw proof that people were clearing the virus. But none was offered. I thought the author wrote this book with a very angry tone and that the homophobia, sexism and racism was unnecessary and really turned me off. 
 This is the worst album I've ever heard.  John Lennon is the most overrated act in history, and Yoko's an absolute joke.  Sean just proves the apple never falls far from the tree.  What did we expect 
 I am afraid I was quite disappointed in this book. The review in the Times that I had read made it sound like a much more profound and important book - one I would like to own rather than just take out of the library. I had previously enjoyed other books by John Mortimer, but this book was just a collection of random musings which did not hold together at all. 
 Since I listened to the unabridged version, I continued through the end.  If I was reading, I would have quit long before the finish.  The text was awful, the reading worse!!  It took a dynamic historical personality and reduced her life to some kind of soap opera persona 
 Another product of Hollywood's "Karaoke Culture".  In an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind, we have in "U-571" an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of "Das Boot".  But instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war, we get a cheap flag-waving pile of Hollywood propaganda. The lighting, camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by DB. But the bigoted innacuracies (German submariners machine gunning helpless sailors) and absurd scenarios (an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit) put this ridiculous movie in its own category. U-571 is just another thin, over-promoted, throw-away movie you'll forget the day after you see it 
 I was so disappointed with this video. I thought it would contain more than it did, but it truly is the most basic of introductions and does not cover much at all. I had one ashtanga yoga lesson and expected this video to at least cover what the lesson did, but it fell far short. This only contains two very basic sequences - surya namaskara A & B, it doesn't even go into the full series and I do not think it gives a very good representation of what ashtanga is about. There is no instruction in standing or sitting poses at all! The two sequences are introductory sequences that lead into the poses, but this video just stops abruptly at that point...  I found ashtanga to be a wonderful blend of relaxing yoga that also gives a full body workout. As soon as I did it, I felt that I had found the perfect exercise and bought this video as a way to practice at home. I ended up giving this video away after watching it twice as it does not contain enough information for the beginner to be inspired or even motivated to study ashtanga further 
 I had an old Krumkake Cast Iron that our hinges finally broke off and thought I would try this unit.  Very disappointing!  Ever cooked with aluminum foil in the oven?  Within seconds from removing it from the hot oven you can touch the aluminum; right?  I found this Cast Aluminum Krumkake Iron to be the same way.  I couldn't control the heat.  I constantly had to adjust the heat on my stove.  How frustrating is that?    I then purchased an electric unit.  Thinking that was the way to go.  Neat concept or so I thought.  You can cook twice as fast - and two at a time to boot.  However I couldn't control the thickness.  If you don't mind the bits of Teflon (we called them, "Black spec surprises") and a cookie that is twice the thickness of an ice cream cone - the electric unit is definitely for you!    [... 
 Diane Stein clearly has a good heart but she is no scholar or theologian. This kind of dabbling in eastern philosophies amounts to a form of racism/imperialism: the assumption of the western new age author that no Tibetan, Indian, or other native Buddhist/Hindu - who would immediately discern the author's lack of scholarly grounding in these ancient religions - is in her readership. Broad, inaccurate statements and erroneous factoids without proper context are retailed as esoteric truths which the author is altruistically passing on.  Sorry. I can appreciate the feminist/egalitarian/debunking agenda, but Diane Stein shows a shocking disrespect in her well-intended liberal condescension and constant essentializing.  Diane, read the late, great Edward Said's "Orientalism" and "Culture and Imperialism" before butchering and packaging eastern philosophical systems! Western readers, please question the source and content of what you read or hear about eastern religions.  
 "I also don't think that there is really a theory of intelligent  design at the present time to propose as a comparable alternative to the Darwinian theory, which is, whatever errors it might contain, a fully worked out scheme. There is no intelligent design theory that's comparable. Working out a positive theory is the job of the scientific people that we have affiliated with the movement. Some of them are quite convinced that it's doable, but that's for them to prove...No product is ready for competition in the educational world. "   -Phillip Johnson Berkeley Science Review, 200 
 I used it once and it charged my ipod only 80% after about four hours.  The next day I tried it again and it simply ceased functioning entirely.  This thing is garbage!  
 Most of Koontz's books carry you right along to the end and are enjoyable, but some derail and go in directions that are not as interesting as others.  I found this book to be that way and despite the 4 star review, was rather bored with it once it got away from Ironheart's rescues.  I'd recommend skipping this one 
 This is a horribly miscategorized book.  While the case studies are entertaining, there is absolutely no advice on how to deal with the situations presented.  The book is sprinkled with humiliating demotivators like "When dumbness at the top insists on perpetuating itself, a miserable life for everyone else is assured."  With no solutions, the book is essentially little more than an extended gripe session, best suited for discussion over a round of drinks at your next pink slip party 
 A friend of mine recommended this book, and Towing Jehovah.  My husband bought them for me for Christmas.  Not only will I never take a book recommendation from this friend again, I will never read another book by James Morrow.  This book was thought provoking?  Only if your thought was "What the heck is he thinking?!"  Morrow's writing style is sadistic, boring, and painful to read.  My first thought reading the first book - "it's got to get better... it has to".  During the second book, ""this one can't be as bad as the first one..."  I was wrong on both accounts.  I am a collector of books, and for the first time ever, I have toyed with the idea of burning or just throwing away two books 
 I have read other John Gray books and have found them wonderful - I usually instantly connect with what he is saying.  I was disappointed with this book and couldn't buy into it since his message was so different.  The discussions on meditation and religion just seemed so out of place and even though I consider myself to be religious (a Christian), they didn't appeal to me at all.  Maybe I got caught off-guard with this one, but I don't want to keep this book on my bookshelf, let alone recommend it to others 
 My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.  What a waste!  The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.  The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program.   Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back.  If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!  I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars 
 The title and pictorial representation leads one to believe that the book would share some light on the past and present exploits of the Clinton's political arranegements.  However the book is in fact a catalog of  ramblings about unsubstantiated charges of corruption at all levels of  government.  Additionally an inordinate portion of the text is dedicated to  the struggles the Clintons went through in their early lives.  It also goes  off on tangents that only remotely relate to the Clinton's felonious life  style.  To the interested student of power brokers this book is replete  with redundancies that leads to a boring and sophomoric exercise 
 I never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks. this Film was wack the Acting,Directing. but the Story Line was cool. in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger Cast this Film would have been interesting.this Film flip flopped Time Periods&it hurt it's cause.I will give Prince Props though for being a Black Film Director back at a time when it was really rare&truth be told in 2004 it ain't that much better on a whole 
 If you've read some of Robert Bly's other books on Direct Mail --you've read this one.  As for chapters other than on Direct Mail, such as "Lead Generation on the Internet", I get the impression that this was written 10 internet years ago.  Bly has some good points but you might want to look at his other books in paperback that will be more cost effective 
 This coffeemaker's design is flawed. But my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best I've received from any company in years. They sent their new thermal carafe model, which appears to have the design flaw with the filter carrier taken care of. Give them a chance to make it right. Customer service is part of the equation with any purchase, and Mr. Coffee/Sunbeam has impressed me on that score 
 Once again, I placed the order for this book February 3 and have yet to receive it.  Either this lady is EXTREMELY popular or the publisher just publised enough books to cover her family and friends.  I am not happy 
 A justly underrated Lumet vechicle, this by-the-numbers turkey explores the world of media interaction with politics during a political convention. Tries to capture the world of show business by looking at the race from different points of view from various politicians and throwing in some (mild) satirical moments, but it's pretentious, farfetched, and unintentionally funny 
 The pathetic thing about scams like this is that we're all searching for ways to secure our future. The thing is, Peter Conti was a smart guy who did some real estate investing... then, he decided to become SMARTER and offer his "Secrets to Success" to everyone else for a fee!  How intelligent is that??? Be realistic people. There are no (legal) shortcuts to fortune other than hard work, inheritance, or winning the lottery. There is money to be made in real estate, and SOME gains may be as easy as he makes them look but the bulk of them are not. Am I rich? No, but I'm comfortable enough NOT to be willing to make someone ELSE RICH by buying products that only sell dreams. Due TRUE research people. Go to CNN.COM and look under Money. They have GREAT savings tips.. great investment tips.. Go to Fidelity.com... Don't make people like THIS Rich *RICHER* in the process. Honestly... any of us can take his book.. reword a few things.. write our own book... and sell some Dreams. Its pathetic. All these GET RICH schemes are designed to get the WRITER rich, NOT YOU! When you're up late at night watching TV and see all these bogus infomercials, turn the channel... Watch Nick @ Nite, anything but the "Dream Sellers". Invest your time and money in things that you can be proud of. Do TRUE research, don't follow behind someone who's only interested in "how much money you're willing to invest in your future" AKA "are you willing to pay for the next seminar because this initial free one is replay of the infomercial you saw on tv." It's designed to get you HYPED UP.  And how do I know?  Well, I've never been to one myself, but I asked my roommate to go to one on "Our" behalf... U know, just to check it out and bring back some Great Information!  Well, "Yeah Right" is an understatement... No great info, just a repeat of the infomercial and a list of prices for the "Upcoming Events." And myself, what I've done, is ordered information about an at-home business that supposedly required "No Selling" (How unrealistic right?) Well the whole thing was, you create a website and let the website sell the product for you... but how likely is that?  I mean, of course you gotta put some effort into it and ultimately you're doing what - SELLING. So luckily I only wasted $50, but some people waste hundreds even thousands on this type of stuff... Don't but the HYPE people. Don't buy it. Just accept that everyone in life is not going to have a mercedes and a $500,00 home... but if you really want it, work hard for it. Put in the time, the effort, and the research... there are honest ways of making a good future but you have to be patient.  And again, I say, do not follow the Dream Sellers like Carlton Sheets, Russ Whitney, Peter Conti and all the others.. unless you have a strong desire to help Them get Richer while you look on in awe 
 The information and exercises in this book are good...BUT...certainly most of us with osteoporosis are past 60, as I am, and this book is fairly small at 5 1/2 x 8 inches. We need to have the print and illustrations larger, darker, and easier for us seniors to see.  My husband agrees with me, and he also found the smaller and lighter print difficult to see and read. That fact didn't seem to be taken into consideration with the creation and publication of this book.      
 If I knew, at the time I saw this movie, that a lot of theaters give back refunds...I sure would have gotten one.  At least the popcorn was good!  Since I love Adrien Brody, I will give him another chance......This movie was nuts.  Skipping between scenes, you really had to be on your toes to figure out what in the world was happening.  
 This short book is about the small Tuck family (a man, his wife, two young-adult sons, and their horse) , who inadvertently drink from a magic spring which renders them immortal.  Thereafter, they do not age, and seem immune to death by violence or accident.  In this state, they seem to live a happy, almost idyllic existence.  Nonetheless, they bemoan their fate as a sort of curse, which has removed them from the cycle of life.  Mrs. Tuck especially seems convinced that it would be a disaster if anyone else were to find out about the magic spring.  The exception to this sighing and moaning is the youngest son, who, perhaps because he has the good fortune to be stuck at 17, seems reasonably satisfied with his fate.  The main events of the story take place 84 years later, when a series of improbable coincidences involving the Tucks, an 11-year old girl, and a mysterious stranger, together with some idiotic behavior by all concerned, converge to force events to an contrived climax.  The author hints that these improbable convergences have some deep mystical significance.  Since this mysticism remains obscure, one is inclined to instead suspect lazy plotting.  The stupidity, and moral depravity, of the Tucks is evident in the fact that, for the last 84 years, they have done virtually nothing to conceal, guard, protect or destroy the magic spring.  And yet when (by pure luck) they learn that the spring is about to be discovered, they are willing to commit kidnapping and even murder to keep the secret from getting out.   The author strives to make the murder victim as unlikable as possible so that the killer (the Tuck mom) will retain our sympathies.  But the bottom line is that the sole motive for the murder is that the victim knew too much and could not be counted upon to keep a secret.  I cannot possibly agree that Mrs. Tuck had any right, therefore, to take his life.  The fact that the victim gloats about his less-than-noble intentions immediately before she shoots him, does not make her act any more morally palatable.  The stream, after all, does not belong to the Tucks.  What right have they to play God, and take lives to prevent others from sharing their high and lonely (if idyllic) destiny?  Setting aside moral questions, the stupidity of the Tucks is nothing compared to the stupidity of the villain.  Why on Earth did he not drink from the stream and render himself immortal?  Why on Earth did he not do this before going all by himself to a secluded location to have a gloating, taunting confrontation with four fully-grown immortals.  He is fully aware that the Tucks are determined to keep their secret, he knows exactly why, and he knows they are desperate or depraved enough to commit the kidnapping of a child for this purpose.  In fact, why does he confront them at all?  They were completely unnecessary to his plans, as he himself points out when, predictably, the Tucks refuse to agree to them.  Bottom line is, he went merely because the author wanted to give Mrs. Tuck an opportunity to shoot him, and he gloated and taunted only so the reader might say "Ha, serves you right", when sweet Mrs. Tuck blows his head off with a shotgun.  One of the ironies of this story is that, although the Tucks are convinced that the widespread availability of the magic water would be a disaster, we are nonetheless supposed to despise the villain for his selfishness, when he reveals his plan to disseminate the water only to those well-paying persons he considers most deserving.   And yet when Jesse, the youngest immortal, starts plotting to do something similar, we are expected to retain our sympathies for him.  I suppose this is because Jesse is a hot-looking 17-year old, is motivated (one supposes) by romance rather than cash, and his offer is, in effect, being made to the young female who is the target audience of this book.    I have no need to say how this latter plot thread resolves itself.  In the end, the moral of the story is ambiguous.  There is a lot of preaching about the curse of immortality, and the virtue of remaining a part of the life cycle, but what we are actually shown is beautiful people living an apparently idyllic existence in harmony with nature.  Is the moral of the story that we should not seek Earthly immortality, or that, if we should find it, we should keep it for ourselves?    This was a quick, easy, relaxing read.  It could have been much worse, but, on the theme of immortality, you will also find plenty better (Potter books, Narnia, Lord of the Rings, just to name a few) 
 I fell in the pond once, and it really wasn't very nice, and this book brought back horrible memories for me, especially with its overly descriptive passages on pondweed and quacking ducks. I was too traumatised to carry on reading. Not a book for sensitive people 
 Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere.  On the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's headstrong daughter.  Between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people.  The premise suggests the ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney.  Jed will fight the good fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie learns just how amoral her side really is.  What robs this courtroom thriller is what's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way, an actual case in controversy.  Maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture, Hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them.  Instead of a compelling case, we have one that's ready for our verdict as soon as we've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices.  The case in "Class Action" is one you can typify as "David & Goliath", which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power.  There's no way that we're going to see a case won (even by dishonest means) by Donald Moffat's hired band of Harvard-trained professional liars, and there's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments.  Maggie's bosses are so transparently bad, that not only do they screw up, but even their explanations are patently evil  Even so, the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery, and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless.  For a thriller about high-paid lawyers, "Class Action" has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial, with fewer suprises 
 I have seen the disagreements among reviewers of Nussbaum's books, and I think that those who are wary of her are better readers both of her work and of the works she discusses. She simply is not reliable in her accounts of what anyone says, ancient, modern, or anything else. On the very first page of this book she makes mistakes as she summarizes the plot of Aristophanes' "Clouds." And she's a classicist? But for real laughs in "Cultivating Humanity" read her way over-simplified explanation of compassion in Rousseau and others. Honestly, she doesn't have a clue about what makes that such a complex passion or what Rousseau thought its purpose should be. In recent years she has embarrassed herself repeatedly on the "Letters to the Editor" page of The New Republic by angrily attacking people for things they never said. That is in keeping with what she does in this book. No, she is not even open-minded enough to fairly represent what other people say and think, never mind to learn from them. And from her we're to learn to live together in harmony with everyone as world citizens? OK 
 Please take this to HEART....  I love Mr. Belushi's acting, he's funny and all...I have nothing against his career and respect him for making all the changes he did in his life...  BUT...I cannot say this louder then this: NOT ALL WOMEN ARE THE SAME!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was reading this, I knew what I was to expect...so I went in with SOME knowledge.   I love a real man, I LOVE A REAL MAN!!  I am NOT your a-typical woman and I will kill or die trying to remain myself.  When ever I see book after book or hear more and more about this ..... I just fume because I will be the FIRST to admit WOMEN'S LIB DESTROYED WOMANHOOD!   BUT and I repeat BUT...NOT ALL WOMEN ARE FOR WOMEN'S LIB AND ALL THE DAMAGE CAUSED IS NOT SUPPORTED BY ALL WOMEN.   I am destroyed by people like Mr. Belushi because THEY think I am one of the group called 'all women' and am judged because I belong to this group.  His book is the most selfish book I have ever read and again, do not get me wrong about being a man, I SUPPORT IT AND CAN'T STAND a man who can't be a man.... for ME, money is NOT status, a career is NOT status and marriage does not complete me!  If you fail at making the money you want, I'll encourage you to lift your spirits and NEVER tell you what job to do...if you don't have the money to take me out or buy me anything, I don't judge the quality of who you are, I will enjoy a night in front of the dvd player with you and I'M HAPPY!  I don't ask you to call because I'm checking up on YOU, I ask you to call and let me know you're safe....I don't snoop in your stuff because I'm NOSEY, I respect your privacy because I TRUST you - give me reason to stand up and NOT take your crap and I will, but ONLY after I shower you with unconditional love and acceptance because I GIVE IT TO YOU, and if that still hasn't reached you, all I can do is then stand up for myself where my man should be protecting me.   Yes, chivalry IS the key to this girls heart, but you better have a set to back that up too!   Your friends are my friends and I love them because I love you and you love them...nothing more, but they sure do take by destroying us since they don't have the 'us' in their own lives... I SUPPORT and WISH THERE WERE more real men out there...there are only two wants from this woman to her man 1-don't cheat on me and lie to my face, I NEED THAT SECURITY (pay attention, my security does NOT come from YOUR paycheck, it comes from your arm wrapped around me, PROTECTING me with your love) and 2- it is YOUR job to take care of us and when you can't, I am right there to get your back NOT to get in your way, NOT to diminish you, but to HELP YOU when you say you need my help.   That did not cost you your friends, did not cost a penny and it did not cost you your freedoms as a man.  I GIVE FREELY, LOVINGLY, UNCONDITIONALLY and ALWAYS not because of the notches on your bedpost, not because it cost you a dime, not because you did it MY way, not because you gave up one dang thing - I gave you every reason to WANT to give me your arm around me and your WANT to protect me.   Two things is all I need to give you an entire lifetime of love, honor, RESPECT and every ounce of my body to you...FREELY...got it???   I am halfway through the book and realized that yeah, I love one of the biggest jerks out there because of who he's become, I will love him til the day I die and will always and I mean ALWAYS give him that love, RESPECT as a man and honor him as MY man....because 'I' want to change ME to be a better woman, not because he got whipped into what I wanted him to be! NOT ALL WOMEN FIT THE BILL OF TRUE WAMONHOOD but I sure am dang proud of myself that I strive for it 
 "Big Fish" is the most horrible movie ever. The only reason i couldn't go any lower than a 1 is because it can't go lower than a 1. I WOULD NOT LIKE TO BUY THIS EVER!!!!!!! 
 This thing looks like a student got a copy of the original off eBay, scanned it in and printed it at Kinkos. Cheesy and close to illegible in parts. This seems to be the new NatLampCo mode of operation. Grave rob their own material and release poor quality reissues. Very sad, too bad. Echoes of the great read it was, but kind of like digging up Marilyn's corpse for a shag 
 While Kant's work is important for many philosophical reasons (e.g., his splendid arguments for how our minds shape our experiences), this book just happens to find Christianity the most rational of all faiths per lots of  convoluted "reasons" as shallow as they are boring 
 The book informs you of various sql commands, but fails to give you the general syntax.  If what you are trying to do has not been explicitely done in the book, it is unlikely to find what you are looking for in the book.  The book is truly a workbook, and nothing else, and should not be purchased as an oracle sql refrence book 
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 This could have been a very exciting book if it had been written by someone such as James Dodson instead of by Mr. Palmer.  Although he shares with us information about many exciting moments of golf matches and  facinating individuals, the book becomes incredibly boring because of all  his first person I-Me-My references 
 I had to read this book in ninth grade honors English.  I thought the book was one more the more profound wastes of time I had ever expended when I was done.  Now that I'm in college however, I do not despise the book as much.  I still feel that it is of very little value.  Had the author been white and not helped along by Ophra, this work would be largely unnoticed.  It's just another story about how someone had a rough life... with nothing to differentiate it from all of the other books like it.  The reason I have rated it so low is because it seemed to be an agenda setting work.  Maya Angelou is black and has used this book to help push her liberal agenda.  Again - if Maya Angelou was white and was not well liked by Ophra, the book would have flopped.  I would not recommend this at all... especially if you are a conservative.  
 Color shown as natural is far from accurate. I am unhappy with color and may return these 
 Oh Leo.. why would you take this role?? I guess I can justify it since it was his early days. I rented this movie on whim. I thought this movie was perhaps a fun look at life as a teenager.. boy was I ever wrong. It was not about diaries and there was very little basketball involved. I was hoping for an inspirational story about a boy who came out of a rough neighborhood, wins the state basketball tournament, gets the girl and receives a full scholarship to Harvard, while recording these life changing moments in his diary. However, none of those events happened. I guess next time I will read the back of the movie to save myself many months of nightmares and therapy 
 Useless product.Soaks water and becomes unbalanced and tilted withing 2 days..waste of money. 
 I don't understand the purpose of this book. The six authors all had their story told in Black Hawk Down already. These stories sound like the boring extended scene versions, whereas Bowden only used the highlights of their actions to better convey the intensity of what happened.   Only one author, Dan Schilling, rose above the cliches and bland writing of the others to write a great story. Interestingly, his chapter is the last one in the book as if the editor knew to save the best for last. His story is the only one with depth and feeling.  I respect these guys as soldiers, but as authors they have a long way to go 
 Here is yet another published response to "Da Vinci Code" which ignores the one exciting idea in the book- the presumption that women, and possibly even relations between women and men, are just as bloomin' divine as single men are.  No wonder that this movie is stirring up animosity in the Church which has consistently sponsored violence toward and mistrust of the feminine. I have yet to see this idea addressed by the Church or the professional "de-bunkers." It would seem that it's much easier to just jump on historical inaccuracies and literary devices and loudly demonstrate how disrespectful they are- that since the author wrote a work of fiction with one stirring idea, that by smearing all the rest of the work the idea will be forgotten. Good try. *sound of weak clapping 
 a friend of mine bought this to check it out... wow was this crap... the guys should just bring Max back 
 The product that was delivered was defective.  The harness system was manufactured with insufficient webbing.  I contacted LaFuma and was informed that this was a recurring problem.  They sent me a mailing label to return the product free of charge and will send me a replacement in mid-April when the new model comes out.  The manufacturer was responsive; however, I was out of pocket $13.00 for a shipping box that I purchased for the mailing.  In fairness, Amazon should reimburse me for this $13.00 expense.  I did not expect to receive a defective product 
 There is some very helpful information in here about how a woman's cycle works. I would be very cautious, however, about the nutrition information. Here is my story:  I was ovulating every 16-18 days with a 11-day luteal phase. Hoping to ovulate closer to every 14 days and lengthen my luteal phase, I began taking the vitamin Optivite, so heavily recommended in the book. I took Optivite for four months, and in that time I would either ovulate extremely late--30+ days followed by a 9 or 10 day luteal cycle-- or NOT AT ALL.   For whatever reason, I didn't immediately connect my ovulation problems with taking the Optivite (seems so obvious now). Then I read something from another source about how excess vitamin A can inhibit ovulation. I then QUIT taking Optivite. My first cycle off of Optivite, my ovulation returned to normal-- and THAT IS WHEN I FINALLY GOT PREGNANT.  It may be that Optivite has helped other women who were really deficient in some of those vitamins. But, in my case, I guess I was healthy to begin with, and it just screwed with my body 
 I'm glad I took this book out of the library before I wasted my money on it.  The only reason I took this book out was to read Kyoko Mori's story which was about the only good one in the entire book next to "Hum" and "Epiphany".  Most of the stories in here, first off, were structured horribly and were seemingly random, jumping from point to point making the story confusing and unreadable.   As for the actual content of 80% of the book - It's all pretty much propaganda. Most of it was "Please pity me!" or "How DARE you pity me!". The usual whiny politically-correct stuff 
 This book teaches you almost nothing about the way to make the head shape- just exepects you to be able to make a perfect egg shape.  Then it expects you to be able to magically draw perfect features.  Then somehow it gets colored with perfect highlights and shading.   I don't recomend this book at all for beginners or people with intermediate skills.  ... 
 I find it difficult to nail down whatever point Niall Ferguson is trying to make here, and must conclude that this is an academic exercise that does not succeed. A British scholar's take on America's imperial behavior can be useful, and he does come up with a few great insights on how empires operate now and in the past. For example, there is plenty of evidence that America's behavior around the world is that of an empire, even though our politicians and population refuse to admit it, while we don't have the will or fortitude to occupy and administer countries for the many years that are necessary for our own "regime change" missions to succeed. Unfortunately, these few solid points are lost in Ferguson's awkward attempts to apply his area of expertise, financial history, to world politics.   Large portions of the book are devoted to a mostly economic history of the old British Empire and the current European Union, representing longwinded and unsuccessful attempts to draw comparisons with modern America. These actually defeat Ferguson's main thesis by focusing on what empires have done wrong in the past. Ferguson relies on a parade of selective and inconclusive economic statistics, including some supremely useless figures like the percentage of Yale graduates working abroad or the average cost per acre of old American territorial purchases. What this really boils down to is that Ferguson has an economic/financial explanation for all historical processes. For example, he summarily dismisses colonialism as an explanation for Africa's problems, tossing aside a universe of knowledge (such as the illogical forcing of nation-state structures on tribal peoples or the use of weak nations as pawns in the Cold War) in favor of an easy explanation concerning spendthrift dictators.   Ferguson also myopically uses finance as his basic interpretation of current events. For example, the fact that Halliburton's share price has recently declined apparently makes the control of Iraq's oil a non-factor in current American operations there. Furthermore, Ferguson believes in the supposed miracle of free trade (including, despicably, the free international movement of exploitable migrant labor) as the utopian cure for all the world's problems, as if the flow of cash and consumer goods can overcome vast issues of culture, religion, and politics. This is ideology, not historical analysis, and it goes hand in hand with the most problematic aspect of Ferguson's thesis - the underlying contention that stronger imperial behavior by the Unites States, as an economic empire, will be advantageous for all of the world's problematic regions. With its unsuccessful economic interpretations of history and dismissal of modern realities of war and culture, this book ultimately defeats itself. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 Overacted. Boring. Horrible movie. The only likable character was Cat. 
 I started this novel primarily because of massive amounts of praise heaped onto it by various family members, claiming it to be a 'DaVinci Code'(with which I have an entirely different set of issues) worthy thriller. More importantly, I am a student of mediaeval history and am willing to give most anything historical fiction/thriller-related a go. I was greatly disappointed with 'The Templar Legacy' not only because of its ridiculously slow pace and rubbish character development (if that phrase can even be applied to the novel at all) but primarily because of the astonishingly apparent lack of in-depth research by its author, Steve Berry. Whilst reading the novel, I honestly felt as if he had merely read abstracts on the topics he covered in the novel and felt that to be sufficient enough to put into final draft. Everything from theology to mediaeval history to religious life seemed to have a veil of inaccuracy hanging upon it, as if the author felt addressing his opinion to be more important than being correct. I was repeatedly shocked at the incorrect, awkward grammar, numerous misspellings of common words, and often overly camp expressions ("The land, as far as the eye could see, oozed the romance of history when marauding knights swooped like eagles from the fortified heights to prey on their foe,"- please.) Where was the editor??  Berry's knowledge of the French phrases and place names in the book is underwhelming, repeatedly changing the accent and capitalisation of the word 'abbï¿½' and misspelling the Palais des Papes. There are numerous errors seemingly every few pages that agitated me more and more as I went on: Berry refers to a character as 'half-Muslim' (Islam is an ethnicity as well as a religion?), misuses the word 'anachronistic', refers to the ancient Egyptian deities Isis and Osiris as Greek, and repeatedly makes errors regarding Catholic dogma and practices. There are numerous more glaring errors that I fail to recall. It may seem petty on my part, but I felt insulted continuously at the transparent lack of research and commitment on Berry's behalf, almost to the point of being unable to finish the book. It was as if he was attempting to seem very educated about the subject matter, spewing facts out left, right and centre, but the overall effect given off was one of shallow arrogance 
 This book is full of excuses and manipulated data that ignores the ultimate moral responsibility of a society.  We can correlate joblessness with the number of innercity households that contain black ink pens if we want to.  While Wilson presents an argument in an attempt to educate, his words are slanted in such a way that we are left feeling "sorry for them" 
 An explanation of each dramatic situation would have been helpful.  However, the author only gives a list of works that a situation can be found in.  The book was not what I was looking for.  I wanted something to help me write conflict and plot.  Maybe it would be helpful if I shifted through the massive reading list the author provides.  Over all, I was not satisfied with this 
 This book was a very organized.  That is one of the few things it had going for it.  The problem I found was the added zodiac, and the fact that it had no real place.  There wasn't even enough information to tell you about what time of year it was.  And where did the information about this New zodiac "Arachne" come from.  There was good information on the Dark aspects of the moon, But is still can't grasp Arachne and when exactly this happens.  My advice is to take it with a grain of salt and enjoy some tidbit 
 Leon R. Kass, M.D., P.h.D., is chairman of the 'President' George W. Bush's Council on Bioethics. This book was intelligently written without any reference to religion but the whole underlying message was "Do not touch Gods property even if it means healing the sick." These religious fundamentalists will do anything to STUNT us in our pursuits of happiness. This guy is for KEEPING PARALYZED PEOPLE PARALYZED. "Dr." Kass is for KEEPING AMPUTEES AMPUTATED. He's for KEEPING the depressed and suicidal DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL. Ill spare you the bull and say what Dr. Kass really wants to say - "I want you to follow Jesus with all your heart no matter how much pain and suffering you are in. If God made you depressed than thats how you should be. If God made you paralyzed then thats how you should be. If you are miserable in your existance then thats obviously how God wants you to be and thats how you will be with our new conservative laws that will effectively ban progress to help people". For this is the ONLY real argument you can use to support the banning of progress designed to help humans. - He wants everyone to follow the 'divine' rule of sanctity of life, not quality of life - an ugly ethic for a very stupid man. 
 ...there is no denying there are errors in this book. My friend's daughter is searching for a college, and after reading my alma mater's entry - I told her to look elsewhere for her information. Signed - a "Mawrtyr" - class of '90 
 I read other people's reviews for this book and thought I would find it very interesting and engaging.  I have read a wide variety of other books either about the Holocaust or at least touch upon the subject, and this one just isn't very good.  I didn't like any of the characters and only some of the stories have any potential to make me smile, laugh or think very deeply.  This is one of those books that is short, so it's easy to read, but the only reason I couldn't put it down is because I was painfully hoping that at some point, it would get better.  I read a lot of books and while this one is okay, overall, I would recommend to skip it 
 It looks cool and it's easy to carry, but that is about it.  Camera is slow and pictures are often blurry.  Sorry I wasted my money on this one.  Get one of the new ones with VR so you don't have that issue.  
 As with all my reviews, I just want to focus on the veterans issue. Like many right-wing war lovers, Rush never served. This shows.  Rush gives a totally ridiculous analogy about why men fight on page 15. After stating this idiocy, he concludes, "[e]verybody does what he is ordered to do because that is the nature of the military." And where did you get that idea, pray tell? I and others did what we had to do because we WANTED to do it. We had pride in service and pride in being elite. I wasn't a paratrooper and jumped out of planes because somebody told me to.  It is odd that Rush would refer to Representative Ron Dellums as "a former draft dodger." You have to turn to page 253 to see where I get mad about this guy. Regarding WWII, Rush states, "[y]oung men lied about their age, ignored medical and physical disqualifications, and abandoned their livelihoods in order to join the services." It is well known how Rush parlayed a correctable anal cyst into 4-F status to stay out of the military and Vietnam. I myself was also deemed 4-F, but obtained a waiver regarding my own physical disability, which was not correctable through simple surgery. Rush speaks of ironies on this about supposed Democrats, saying they would turn into "chicken hawks" (page 258) at the "first sign of trouble." Well, buddy, that was you on Vietnam. On that same page, he talks about Vietnam--the war I was in as a volunteer and he "volunteered" to stay out of.  Rush again forgets to look in the mirror after stating, on page 259, that the military has "unique requirements...no matter whose feelings get hurt, including heterosexual men who can't meet the physical or ment requirements." Since you did not meet the physical requirements (but could have with one short doctor visit), do you feel hurt, Mr. Limbaugh?  It also makes no sense, except in the context of people too cowardly or self-absorbed, his statement, "[r]ecruitment is down...and the intelligence level of those enlisting is lower." The easiest way to correct that problem is for all these right-wingers to go down and sign up. I really start to burn at the end of page 261. Check this out. "Most of us are so detached, so smug, and so far removed from the battlefields where our fathers fought...we cannot beging to empathize with them." Hey, my dad, granddad and me all got our OWN battlefields. He wags a finger at the reader with, "[d]on't ever forget the WWII generation, nor abandon the cause for which it sacrificed." Oh, puleeze, Rush, what about Korea and Vietnam? Got a problem with those of us who sacrificed fighting communism?  Rush reminds me of another fat windbag and draft dodger strutting around, making other men go out to do what he didn't have the guts to do himself: Benito Mussolini.  
 I am into reading Emmett Fox, Catherine Ponder, and Murphy and had read the reviews of this book and bought it.  However, I  was very disappointed.  This author just sounds like he has read a bunch of other positive thinking books and have paraphrased his own book.  I think it sounds so fake.  I think I could have written this.  Not motivating, I couldn't even stay with it 
 Now I'd actually give this movie 3.5 stars. But since so many people talk about being one of the greatest movies ever made I'm giving it a 1. The story was quite good in how it dealt with the American Dream and how a dysfunctional a family can be behind a seemingly perfect house. Kevin Spacey gave an excellent comedic performance as Lester Burnham, the one with the midlife crisis. Annette Benning's character Carolyne is Lester's obsessive-compulsive perfectionist wife who's role tells us the consequences of giving more importance to material things over family. But there were parts in the film which didn't make much sense. What's with Janie showing her breasts through the window at Ricky? How come Ricky stood naked in front of her during a conversation? There was no need for that. A girl her age especially would freak if a guy stood naked in front of her like that. But she seemed perfectly fine with it. Also Ricky's point about the plastic bag he filmed having beauty in how it freely danced in the wind is just another pathetic attempt at being artistic. This is apparently just another arthouse film that critics praise, making it seem better than it really is. Frankly it was also very dull and depressing. 
 You all are right.  The ink is where they get you.  It doesn't even last a semester.  It's cheaper to print my papers at the library than at my house 
 Same theme and style all the way through almost monotone, nothing stood out on this one.  I played once and it's sitting on the shelf 
 I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.  This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
 Almost every character in this book is unlikeable, unbelievable, and leads a life of unremitting misery, to no end.  Morris gratuitously gives even her most minor characters sickening motives and gross stupidity.  Morris writes well, but her vision of reality is badly flawed.  The book is a mess, so depressing that, thank God, by the end it's almost laughable.  
 I've read more than a few of Greg Bear's books but have come across no books of his that were anything like Queen of Angels.  If I didn't know better I'd say there was a bug in his word processor that removed all the punctuation.    I put this book down a dozen times an finally gave up on it.  I never could get into it becuase I like to read one story at a time... not four.  I also like sentences that are structured.  I'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with this but I don't recommend it at all.  It will basically frustrate the crap out of you to try and read it.  
 You got what you deserved....another cheap product by this manufactured "artist", a woman with no talent at all, who can't sing, who can't dance, who can't compose songs, who LIP SYNCHS all her "live" show, including the recent ROCK IN RIO LISBOA.    So, you got a "product" with only 30 minutes of old and silly MTV videos. Congratulations.    This girls is a phenomenon of mass hypnosis. It's some of the wrost piece of "musica" ever to appear in America 
 Given the build up for this book, I found it very disappointing. It completely ignores the fact that most American companies have failed in China -- precisely following the strategies the author advocated!  If you know very little about China, and have eaten at a Chinese restaurant a couple of times, this book should provide an easy introduction.  Otherwise, pass on it!  I would much rather recommend "New Asian Emperors:  The Overseas Chinese, their Strategies and Competitive Advantages" by George T. Haley et al. for a more complex understanding of business culture in the region 
 i though i hated yu-gi-oh because mostly everyone i played against summoned like a dark magician without even sacrificing  weird right :( so instead i bought the computer yugi the destiny 2 learn how 2 play im a very good duelist now  because i have 2 god cards obelisk and shining dragon so i bought this deck and i found this deck was unstoppable 
 Don't be seduced by Pinkermania; he's trapped in a little box and he won't be taking a look around anytime soon. Edward Oaks couldn't have said it better in his review:  http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9803/articles/oakes.htm 
 I gave this a 2nd star for a support call ms provided.  If you do have a frontpage server, and have it set "on", it had some advantages over ftp.  I bought it for use on our family website which is mainly pictures.  I've used 6-8 programs for creating galleries over the years.  I think a perl script using Linux' mogrify worked best.  This works worst!  The free ones w/ the digital cameras beat it.  Frontpage is missing the most fundamental piece to view photos-  A next/previous button.  You can choose from several thumbnail displays including a cool mosaic/colage type thing.  Once you expand it, you must remember the shot you were on, back up, and then click on the next one!  Unbelievable.    I know what I need for handling photos efficiently.  Flicr has it- cross-tab indexing of the same photo.  I think picassa is close and getting closer.  This wasn't worth the cost of Picassa- FREE 
 Unlike the other reviewers, I found this book to be less than helpful.  Yes, it does talk some about different literary-related fields, and I stress some, but the book lacks serious discussion of those careers.  Plus, it gives limited resources for finding out more information....no websites and no mention of other literary career-related books.  It only lists a few professional associations for each career.  Also, there were no surprises as to which careers were selected, such as...becoming a librarian.  If you just want a taste of what literary careers are out there, this book is worth a skim at your local bookstore, but if you really want to find out about these careers, follow up with books specifically geared toward a particular career 
 I was a fan of Robert's since his days at Ohio State.  I admired him for his stance he took then by skipping football for a year.  Although, I missed watching him on the field, I respected him more for doing that.  I also respect him for the work he does today with kids.  However, I found the book to be mediocre.  He has some interesting opinions (most I don't agree with), but he usually doesn't go into enough detail when supporting them.  He talks about football for 85% of the book, then crams all kind of issues in the final 15%.  He probably would be better off either writing a longer book or another book altogether.    I am curious as to why most every review touches on his intelligence.  I found that to be irrelevant.  Some people attacked him because of some grammatical issues early on in the book.  While I noticed these, I thought it was more important on what he was trying to say.  If you are that put off on these minute details, I have some of the most boring books on the planet I can send you that are grammatically correct and you can spend the next 5 years reading them.  I really don't think Robert cares if you believe him to be intelligent or not.  I know I wouldn't.    Overall, I thought there were some interesting stories and I appreciated his honesty.  However, I found the book to average at best and it's overall layout didn't seem to make much sense. 
 I read this for a bookclub and was very disappointed.  I was eager to hear true stories of homeless life in New York, but what I got was barely readable fantasy.  It seems to me that Ms. Toth wrote a successful article on this topic for the L.A. Times and then decided to 'cash in' and make it into a full-blown book.  Only problem is that she didn't do any research, fact checking, or even actually visit many of the places she claims to have visited.  The whole production feels so slapped together, for example chapters on subway graffiti (interesting, but not really related at all to the subway dwellers), fictional accounts of living underground (HG Wells....) etc.  Many stories are repeated several times throughout the book, presented as if we had never herad about them before when we had read the same exact thing a few pages ago!  Who edited this? This work can at best be called irresponsible journalism.  READ AT YOUR OWN RISK 
 Like another reviewer, I picked this novel up with the intention of broadening my literary horizons. Unfortunately, I found The Victim to be an extremely unlikable read, so much so that I had to force myself to finish it.   The novel is about a Jewish man, Asa Leventhal, who, while his wife is away, encounters an old acquaintance who both accuses Asa of ruining his life and demands Asa to make them "even." Concurrently, Asa encounters family troubles when his estranged brother's family has a crisis.  Through Asa's dealings with the old acquaintance, questions arise as to the nature of luck and blame in American life. Is an individual solely responsible for achieving success? Can others be blamed for an individual never achieving that desired success? Is everyone born with the same ability to achieve success, and if not are some people simply lucky?   These seemingly valid questions were not what I was thinking of as I read this novel. Mostly, I was disappointed by the unlikable characters and oppressive mood of the novel. Asa plays the curmudgeonly Jew perfectly, constantly lamenting being a Jew and noting how he is treated unfairly by his Christian counterparts. While sometimes his woes are valid, at other times he seems simply paranoid. His former acquaintance, Kirby Allbee, is the anti-semite that feels wronged. He's presented as a drunken manic, constantly spewing vitriol while still expecting to be given something for his suffering.   The mood, created by the hot summer setting, the loneliness from Asa's wife being away, the tense, and the angry quality of Asa and Allbee's dialogue is horrendous. It was stressful simply reading this novel, because the characters experienced so much stress. I'm not saying that every novel needs to be as light as Jane Eyre, but ugh... this was simply not a pleasure to read! 
 I was looking forward to reading The Exorcist but I was let down. The book is boring it doesn't go into any real depth when it comes  to characters. The movie surpasses the book, I feel asleep while reading this book. Some people may feel that this book is scary but its only scary if you scare easily.   
 This book is good for some situations, but it is not appropriate for planned single parent families, i.e. through donor insemination or adoption.  More specifically, it is designed for talking about why the man who fathered you is not here, not for talking about why I chose to start a family with you without a father 
 Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 Pro's: I got my package within three days. I did recieve what I ordered. The size charts were a big help and the pants fit pretty good. Con's: On the description it says the scrubs have a high thread count and our made of non see through material. That is wrong!  The pants are soo see through that you can see the color of my legs and my white undergarments 
 As they said in the Wendy's commercial "Where's the beef?".  Don't waste your money or time on this one 
 I read the other favorable reviews of this movie and bought it. I was clearly misled. I have never written a review before, but after watching this terrible movie I felt it my civic duty to warn others not to buy it.   I love movies and have hundreds of DVDs. This DVD is among the worst I have ever purchased.   I generally love Anthony Quinn as an actor, like James Coburn as an actor and love pirate movies. However, this is the worst so called "pirate" movie that I have ever seen. The acting by all of the actors in this movie is appalling: it is flat and boring throughout. Every actor seems as if they are half asleep or drugged throuhgout the movie. The actors fail to convey a single spark of human emotion, drama or interest in the story.   This an instantly forgettable movie. The "plot" makes no sense and is entirely uninteresting. For example, 5 children are forciblly taken from one ship to another and kidnapped by pirates and all the while the chidren never come to the realization that anything has gone wrong or that their captors are even pirates!  Nothing interesting happens in any part of the movie. It is infinitely tiresome and boring. There is not a single sword fight, not a single cannon fired, nor a single sea battle (that is depicted anyway--one sea battle is supposedly carried on during the movie--but no part of it is shown).   Additionally, every actor in this movie remains constantly terrified of one thing or another throughout the movie. Despite the fact that the plot calls for the actors to be terrified, they sleepwalk their way through their parts failing to convey even the slightest credibility that the actors are capable of displaying any human emotion.  The movie begins with a tropical hurricane in Jamaica. During the hurricane, the house of a plantation owner is seriously damaged. Afterward the plantation owner decides to send his children on a sea journey of several thousand miles to England to live with their grandparents there--without either parent making any effort to accompany the children on such an arduous voyage. All of the children are boring snobs who are entirely unlikable. The children are elitist, obnxious, self-centered, spoiled brats throughout the movie who constantly spout doom and gloom and inflict misery and misfortune everywhere they go.   The plot has the actors stumbling from one misfortune to another and never has a redeeming moment. In the end, one of the children accidentally stabs a man to death and the pirates are all hung for it because the young girl fails to tell what truthfully happened. Defying credulity, Anthony Quinn goes to his death smiling and joking.   At the end, the children all return to their Patrician lifestyle as spolied little rich children playing at their father's plantation without another thought as to the deaths of the pirates or their previous (boring) adventure.   There is not a single memorable moment in this film. It is quite simply awful.   Don't be misled by the other favorable reviews:   DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE.    
 I purchased this shampoo for my daughter after she read rave reviews in a teen magazine.  She has thick, blonde hair and it was dry from summer heat, pool water, and light styling.  After trying the rehab shampoo, she was so disappointed that it did nothing to help her hair.  She said that while it lathered nicely, it felt like it stripped her hair and when it rinsed out, it left her hair overly 'squeeky' and tangled.  The end result once her hair was dried (after using conditioner, too), was that it was a lighter shade of blonde, very fly-away, and dry feeling.  She was hoping for smoother, easier to manage hair.  We debated purchasing this shampoo because of its high cost, and I have to say we are extremely disappointed.  The claims were hype, and the results were not delivered.  Her hair was by no means 'fried' or severely damaged, so I fully expected her to have some more manageable locks after using the product, based on its claims.  I will say that I bought her a shampoo and condition at the drug store that has helped dramatically.  It is Thermasilk Smooth & Silky line, and it works wonders over Rehab for a fraction of the cost.  Save your money on this one 
 "Playback" is Chandler's least of everything.  It's his least funny, least compelling, and least believable novel.  Most Chandler/Marlowe novels stretch credulity in the big picture by using far-fetched coincidences to tie plot threads together.  A few of his books--especially "The Big Sleep" and "Farewell, My Lovely"--are so good, I don't even mind.  But "Playback" stretches credulity in little moments.  And in such moments, the dialogue is often painful to read, to wit: "Don't kid yourself.  You're a dirty low-down detective.  Kiss me."  Ugh.  The stale cliche of the resisting female melting in Marlowe's arms after some forceful manhandling is beyond tiresome.  It's annoying.  I'm not sure what the opposite of unputdownable is (must be putdownable), but whatever it is, that's "Playback."  I waded through its scant 166 pages, and I felt like I was fighting a riptide the whole way.  This book is for the diehard Chandler/Marlowe fan in the same way that "Pylon" is only for the diehard Faulkner fan or "Answered Prayers" for the diehard Capote fan.  Chandler published "Playback" five years after "The Long Goodbye."  You'd think in five years he could've mustered a better piece of writing and re-writing.  But, figuratively speaking, he mailed this one in 
 Buddhism & Christianity have only one thing in common; MORALITY. Nothing else.  The author needs to find other ways to make money. This book encourages ignorance, and delusion.

 A lot of the information suggests diets and foods that are not acceptable for everyone.  They push macrobiotic and raw diets which are not the best.  Many vegetables (such as tomatoes) need to be heated at a particular temperature enable to reach their full nutritional value.  Also this book suggests many soy-based products, when in reality soy was created as an easy substitute to cow-dairy and is extremely processed.  Many consumers are unaware of the fact that soy is very toxic to the body and is only nutritional when fermented (tempeh or miso).  Someone who is allergic to cow-dairy should try goat-diary.  Goat cells are smaller and easier for humans to digest, and has far more nutritional value and no allergens that cow diary  is exposed to 
 This book does not give helpful hints...It is written by some crazy man  who refers to his reader as "creature" and he talks to  himself....I prefer Acting Games : Improvisations and Exercises ISBN:  0916260925 to this one 
 Mr. Irving has played on misinformation to form a seemingly interesting book that unfortunately continues a tradition of propaganda dating back over 50 years.  His deliberately flawed research relies on known propaganda, both from Nazis still active in the war and later Soviet sources, both with obvious reasons to twist the truth against the Allies.  And he "embellishes" details from the National Archives in Washington, twisting the facts to supply histrionic twists designed to paint Allied (especially American) forces as being the servants of Satan himself!  Irving is a discredit to authors of truth everywhere.  If you want an accurately and painstakingly researched book about the destruction of Dresden that is a fantastic read and depicts the actual truth (including the horrors) with countless interviews of survivors, read "Dresden, Tuesday, February 13, 1945" by Frederick Taylor.  Irving's book should be sent to the trash bin. 
 Moore can write -- well enough to keep the pages turning and to show that she has a brain. But I think she's squandered her talents with this book. The purported "eroticism" isn't much more than uninspired pornography, and the "thrill" is pretty much nonexistent, with an ending that is easy and not particularly surprising in the way that a good, intelligent crime/mystery is when it rises above its genre. The narrator is so detached and flat that it's hard to know or feel much about her -- and while that persona may have been Moore's attempt to reflect her ultimate ending (which I won't give away here), the end did not justify the means. I was annoyed that I had to endure a gruesome scene with no payoff, and that I wasted my time reading this book at all when I could have been reading something much more original, complex, and interesting. Not recommended 
 while I appreciate what Tipler was attempting to accomplish, he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective.  skip this one! 
 Mr. Haqqani's views about his mother country are very dubious. The only question I have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner...What has he done for his home land? Nothing!!! This book in waste of time. 
 Words cannot describe how disgusted I am by this book. It takes everything we know to be fact and spits and tramples all over it.   This book is the exact equivalent of the same kind of garbage that was spewed by 19th century racist "scholars" like Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Oswald Mosley, and John Burgess. Just as they argued for white supremacy, so too does George James argue for the opposite. Nothing ever changes it seems; millions of people have to suffer and die because of racist ideologies, and yet people never truly learn the dangers of such a sickening worldview.  First of all, I'm not against people re-analyzing history. All historians will often look back at their work, or the work of someone else which may have become antiquated over the years. New ancient works may be discovered which challenge the viewpoints which we may have held as fact for decades. This is good. It allows us to get a more accurate view of the ancient world so as to learn from it. This is different from revisionist history, where the thesis is largely debated among historians. Unfortunately, and it's sad to say, this book doesn't even qualify under revisionist history; it's full of malignant lies. For those who haven't read it, here's a summary:  James argues that Egyptian civilization was black. Fair enough; if that's his argument, he must have proof, right? Well, not quite. DNA testing which has recently been done on mummified corpses (by scientists from ALL races, mind you) shows that they contained traces of Nordic, Semitic, and Persian, among many others. This was seen for both the Pharaohs and the lower class corpses. By my calculation, this means two things; either A) There is a worldwide conspiracy among all scientists involved to hide their true findings and simply make stuff up in order to fill their own agenda, or, more likely, B) James hasn't a clue what he's talking about. According to James, everyone in Egypt was black...except for the hundreds of people whose DNA indicates they were not. But hey, I guess it's possible for two entirely black people to have a Semitic/Persian/Nordic child.   It gets worse. Did you know that the Greeks were simply crooks who stole all of their ideas from the Egyptians? That's right, the Greeks didn't invent anything, it was all stolen! James has proof too: Aristotle travelled to Egypt, where he visited the Library of Alexandria and stole all of the knowledge from the Egyptians. Ouch, that's pretty rough isn't it? That's enough proof to put the nail in the coffin of Greek learning. There's just one problem; it's not true. Aristotle died in 322 BC. The Library of Alexandria was built by Ptolemy II Philadelphos, who ruled from 281 BC to 246 BC. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but it would be pretty difficult for Aristotle to steal ideas from a Library which was built over 40 years after his death. But hey, in Mr. James' book the dead not only rise again, but also steal ideas and formulate complex thought patterns in only a short matter of time.   "The term Greek philosophy, to begin with, is a misnomer, for there is no such philosophy in existence." This is what he writes early in the book. I don't even know how to refute this argument, if one could call it such. James believes that Greeks stole their ideas from Egypt. Philosophy, science, all of it. To be fair, this belief could be possible. The Greeks were definitely influenced by the Egyptians; only a liar would deny that. But here's what I don't understand. How is it that after the Egyptians had their ideas stolen from them, they don't make a single mention of these philosophical ideas? The Egyptians were notorious for how well they recorded their achievements, yet not a single papyrus scroll, engraving, or work of art mentions anything about philosophy. This leads me to believe that either, A) The Greeks stole the Egyptian's ideas, and then Egypt suffered an epidemic of amnesia whereby everyone forgot that they ever had these ideas, or B) James is full of it. Imagine, if you will, that you and a friend are writing an essay on the same topic. Your friend comes over and, while you're unaware, steals your paper and hands it in before you. Now, instead of reporting him for what he's done, you completely forget that you ever wrote a paper, and cheerfully go about your life as if nothing happened. Sounds ridiculous, right? Yet this is the exact type of logic James uses in his book, where it is just as laughable.  I just don't understand what the point of this book is. That blacks are better than whites? Even if that were true, what does the author propose? That we discard all of Greek and Roman history because it's stolen? That schools should only teach history about black people? James never actually discusses why he wrote this book.  However, what sickens me most about this book is that it completely ignores the fact that Africa actually extends BELOW just Egypt and Nubia, and that marvellous civilizations have existed there since long before these two. African civilization is largely unknown because the tribes in sub-Saharan Africa to a large extent relied on oral tradition. There tribes did not have a Livy, Polybius, Thucydides, or Tacitus to record their achievements with a fair degree of accuracy. It is sad to say, but what is today known as sub-Saharan Africa has for a long time garnered an atrocious press. Racist ideologues called them savages and barbarians, simply because their civilization differed from theirs, and sadly, this view has stuck in many places around the world. Indeed, the truth is that Africans have a lot to be proud of, just as Europeans and Asians do. Men like George James do nothing but cause even more hatred when it is not needed. 
 I was very interested in this product when I read the description.  However, after recieving the product was disappointed to find that way in which you catch a liar is to become a bigger and more manipulative liar.  If you have any sense of intergrity ignore this product.  The author must me one of the biggest decievers out there to put such effort in this product 
 Funny and helpful, but it did recommend a hotel we stayed at that really [STUNK]! This hotel was so bad that a tour group of 30 that had just arrived via bus, was getting back on the bus an hour later.  Get a Frommer's or Access New Orleans guide instead 
 I'm a fan of Maggie Osborne's novels. But I found Prairie Moon to be tiresome. Mostly because I just didn't like either Della Ward (the heroine), or James Cameron (the hero.) Della was too self-pitying. Cameron also suffered from his share of overblown angst, but was also a bit cold. The whole 'quest' to find Claire (the daughter Della was forced to give up at 17) was very unsatisfying.      I like Osborne best when she sticks to Americana, but also when the subject matter is a little more upbeat. This novel dwelled a bit too much on the past (the fate of Della's late husband Clarence), and the fate of her child (Claire), and not on the relationship or current situation of either of the main two characters. Because Claire and James' pasts were not that upbeat, I found it a trifle maudlin and not very romantic. My advice? Skip Prairie Moon, unless you simply MUST read an author's entire backlist 
 If you want to know about more than just the Puerto Vallarta area buy the Pacific Mexico Handbook. Better than 80% of the content of the Puerto Vallart Handbook is included as well as information of the other Pacific destinations. If you do not plan to venture more than 25 - 50 miles from Puerto Vallarta this book adds no additional value 
 I don't so much mind the money I wasted on this book, it's the time that bothers me. Bill Rancic, you're fired 
 I was left wanting a little more after getting this book.  You would think a Vogue book would have up to date styles.  I found a lot of the patterns dated and even kind of ugly.  I wouldn't spend my valuable time knitting something that I wouldn't want to wear myself 
 I was under the impression that there would be meanings for most of the designs.Don't get me wrong, there were some nice designs, but, I was looking for meanings for the symbols and drawings 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 This machine is totally a waste of time, you would never ever make a pasta in 15 minutes, you would make the pasta in 4-5 hours.  The mesurements of the flours and eggs would never make the appropiate mixture. After lossing your 5 hours to make the mixture, you get the second problem, the mix would not get in the hole so the pasta can get the form you want b/c is to dry for the mixture to go down that hole.  If you want fresh pasta you are better off buying a manual machine and do it your self, or better yet go to the supermarket and they would have fresh pasta on the fridge. 
 This installment of WoT was totally forgettable. In fact, I may have read this book twice without any hint of recollection. I think fans of this series can safely skip this book without any loss of continuity. If you absolutely need to read it for yourself then simply skip to the last chapters featuring Perrin, Mat, and Egwene. These three chapters contain ALL of the plot developments. As for the rest of the chapters: * Elayne and Rand do nothing.  * There are no battles.  * Nothing important happens to any major characters. The good news is that an editor/author will make a truly great work some day by producing an abridged/plagiarized version of this story. Just three volumes, 1500 pages, and non-stop action. This will be the fantasy classic that will be read by generations to come. Too bad Jordan/TOR let go of the reins and allowed greed to run rampant over an extremely promising storyline 
 This is not the book I was expecting... I know the author try her best, but I found that this book have very few names for each letter, in fact I found out more french names in other book than in this one, and the title  foucuses on French names.....I'm a bit dissapointed. The cover it's great  but the lack on information is wat I regret...Certainly, in my opinion it  is not worth it's value, in fact, I'll try to return it, it is not what I  was expecting 
 This book is another product designed to get you to buy Gary Null's ever expanding product base. Here we have the same information just recycled under a new title with Null's non-traditional PhD added. Gary knows everything and anything about everything so eat his organic vegetarian diet with juicing to detox and lose weight. Gary advises a limiting, costly, bland, and impossible to follow regimen for the normal working person who is out of the house much of the day. So the person tries it out and is guaranteed to fail. But that is the point of Gary Null Inc.- advocate a regimen few will be able to follow so that they will buy his costly supplements and meal replacements. Then get them to tune in to his radio program so he can scare his audience with gloom and doom so that they can buy his magnets, water filters, air cleaners etc. Finally promise your audience the fountain of youth and the ability to live forever with no illness and you have got lifetime customers and a multi-million dollar a year revenue stream 
 I have been using a Polar s610 for some time.  When everything is working it is a wonderful device.  However, it is difficult to keep it running smoothly.  For example, when I upgrade to a new computer I go through hell getting the software to work again.  Polar customer service is useless.  Most recently I have been unable to upload data from the monitor to my PC via USB for months.  I do not believe I will be able cure the problem without PURCHASING new software +  the software dose NOT include the USB connection software.  That is sold seperately.  Polar will not provide replacement software unless you purchase it on CD.  The rest of the world will provide software and upgrades to registered users online.    Bottom Line - the product is pretty good.  However in terms of user friendly Polar is a total failure.  Sorry folks - why not get a Garmin 305 - I a 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 An unreadable book.  Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.    I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it.  Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  Not in this case.  Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read. It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last 
 This book is plainly boring in every way. The plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting. The first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars, and the second half deserved roughly one star. If you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart, then I suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting, like "Barney Goes to the Zoo". Do not, and I repeat: DO NOT read this book. If you would like to take interest in this novel, save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. You WILL be disappointed 
 I'd give Sony an F for allowing this product out the door. My Sony regular memory stick always worked fine in my Toshiba Satellite P25 with built in memorystick slot.  Now, I used two of these Magic Gate Sticks to document an overseas trip and I'm stuck because the notebook cannot read the Magic Gate format. I'd avoid anything that says magic Gate.  
 The dog part was kinda interesting but the eclipse flashback(s) was disgusting and the rest of the book was really boring. It also could have easily ended about 50 or 60 pages before it did. But at least its short for a King book (445 pages) and I was able to force myself through it in a few days. Out of the 17 or so King books I've read this was definitely the worst, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you want to read every Stephen King book there is. - - 3/1 
 This is a waste of black ink on white paper. Save your money 
 This book is a departure from others I've read by the same authors.  There is little flow or organisation to the material.  Detailed technical info is presented, only to be often times refuted by the authors in a side-note as  not of true value.  Therefore I feel the only value in this book is in the  authors' side notes, which are in themsevles often arcane 
 What i mean by the title of my review is yes this movie is going to be funny its Monty Python! but there is also some parts where it just really gets out of hand in my mind. If you are new to Monty Python I would get the quest for the holy grail before this one. Also the Monty Python's Flying Circus is great too. It comes in a 16 DVD set so it will give you a lot of their old stuff. I really did not enjoy certain parts. But there is a few good moments.  
 Putting aside the controversy associated with the book and its author ... it's just so incredibly drab. I'm not sure why anyone would have believed that a five-year-old was capable of all the physical and mental tasks Carter purports to have done with his Granpa.   Nothing happens until the very end of the book, when finally we see some action. The first 3/4 of the book is devoted to entire chapters on berry picking, planting, whiskey making and "The Way" ... and as boring as that is, it's nothing compared to sitting in his secret place. 
 A director who has no idea how to film dance sequences? An important song transmuted into God knows what? Mis-casting galore? A female star without one iota of chrisma? (If she stopped 3 shows cold they must have been high-school productions!) This is...or should have been...about the struggle to not only get a job on Broadway but to hang-on to that which is starting to fade. The all important role of Shiela seems little more than an after thought. Turned into a silly love story (which doesn't even play!) it is merely sad. Sad...and very, very BAD!!!  (the one star rating is because I HAD to rate it! 
 As a second generation Irish-American Catholic, I hoped to find a good story wrapped within the unique Irish-American perspective of life.  However, I was very disappointed for the following reasons:  1) the story was too simplistic (and full of tired cliches), 2) the characters were one-dimensional stereotypes and 3) the main characters (and their family) were claustrophobic in their smug superiority.  I have seen too many families that present just this outward image while hiding a truth that would be more beneficial for all to see the light of day.  Isn't it ironic now that the theme of the distorted family image of the O'Sulivan family is in fact duplicated by the depiction of the Coyne/McGrail clan.  Surely I won't be coming back for a second helping 
 Words Fail Me brings a lighthearted approach to the misery of grammar and punctuation. Patricia T. O'Conner does a good job of  making insistent humorous jokes during the course of this book but leaves the reader without a sense of actually learning anything of value. After reading this book I found myself not wanting to ever hear another English joke again!  
 Two stars is the equivalent of a D in school.  D is for dumb, as in the language used in this translation.  However, before it sounds like a personal insult to anyone, the author explains that a more simplistic and less poetic style is what he intended.  and besides, the guy reads chinese.  he clearly isn't dumb.  Nevertheless, i like the poetic style that other translators have used.  Sun Tzu's concepts are timeless, and they could hardly be seriously damaged by an unorthodox translation, but i personally find the poetic style more accessible.  the primary reason for this is its beauty.  beauty is more easily recalled than blandness.  it is easier for me, and many others i suspect as well, to remember beautiful language.  the purpose of beautiful language is to express the ultimately inexpressible.  simple "how to" language fails to do this because it lacks beauty and is utterly pragmatic...that is to say, it lacks a personality and is usually forgetable.  Sun Tzu's work, as my reading of it goes, is less of a 'how to fight a war' as it is 'artful expression of power-relationships'.  the title says it all: "the ART of war"  not "war for dummies"        (though, come to think of it, that would make a catchy bumper sticker).  Artful expression was sun tzu's ultimate intention, and the spirit i believe he held when compiling this work.  "plain english" does a disservice to this spirit of artful expression.  Societies have always suffered when the sublime is sacrificed upon the altar of clumsiness.  Go for the poetry instead. 
 When one watches a George Bernard Shaw play, one does not expect three-dimensional characters with social roles and inner lives.  As the author puts it in a pompous forward to this film, 'Major Barbara' is a 'PARABLE' (his capitals), and the preaching never lets up.  The title character (Wendy Hiller) is the daughter of a millionaire arms manufacturer (Robert Morley); she is a zealous Salvation Army officer, trying to convert the destitute of London with enthusiasm, sympathy and 'a bribe of bread'.  She is seen one afternoon in mid-proselysation by Adolphus Cusins (Rex Harrison), an impoverished Classics scholar who determines to marry her.  The stage is set for a typical Shavian problem play - you might subtitle the piece 'The Soul of Man Under Capitalism', with the religious fanatic and the urbane industrialist doing battle for the souls of the English working and middle classes.  Barbara is tested by drama; Undershaft fights back with mind-numbing spectacle - capitalism's genius is that it absorbs all opposition.  The loser is the audience.  'Barbara' is one of Shaw's less intolerable plays, with the odd funny line (all snatched by Marie Lohr as Barbara's aristocratic mother) peeping through the flat epigrams, laborious dailogues and general sterile clever-cleverness.  The wonderful cast - Hiller saintly and sexy in military uniform; Harrison hysterically smart-*r*ed; Morley unflappably Machiavellian and Mephistophelean - do what they can, but they are playing Ideas, not Characters, and their attempts to blow life into cardboard only results in soggy paper.  It's never nice being aggressively lectured to, and Shaw's grinding dialectic becomes less agreeable on the big screen - his use of old dramatic forms for non-dramatic purposes stops everything dead (although you can see how filming an ironic play about the armanents industry might have seemed radical during World War 2).  The works isn't improved by Pascal's hapless filming (what can he do?), his style as clunky and grey as Shaw's sub-Wildean wit.  There are some major talents behind the scenes, including David Lean as editor and William Walton as composer 
 Obviously, anything can get published nowadays. I wouldn't want to be rude to the author, and I didn't find anything wrong with her writing. If you want to know how to raise a left-handed child in a right-handed world, I'll save you the money here. Just raise him/her like any other child. It has nothing to do with what hand is dominant. Seriously, I think the self-help books are getting a bit carried away, now. I'm left-handed myself, but there were a lot of things that didn't necessarily apply to me. I can't see any reason why you would need a book like this. It's all stuff you've already heard. I'm calling her publishers to see if they'll publish my book on the proper way to inhale when you exhale without hurting your child's self-esteem 
 The validity of Ressler's information is automatically questionable considering he seems to use this book as a way to get back at his former colleagues with the BSU.  I found myself laughing at times when he gives himself considerable amounts of credit for progress in a case or his repeated claim of coining the term "serial killer".  This inflated sense of self takes away from all the information that the book provides.  The interviews with Gacy and Dahmer are interesting.  However, I wonder how accurate they are because Ressler seems so concerned about looking smart and good at what he does.  It is apparent that he has something against John Douglas, who is the guy you should be reading anyway 
 How sad it is read such a poorly written and conceived book about such an interesting subject!  This book is a tragic waste of wonderful material.  I hope that another biographer with greater literary skills decides to take  on Armand Hammer 
 Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption.   The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.  The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.  The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?  I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write.   If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting 
 Professor Jenkins has written with insight and clarity on a number of controversial topics, unfortunately, while this book raises some important points, it is rather tendentious compared to his past works. At one point, he claims that the Clinton Administration's Health Security Initiative failed to make it into law because of the Administration's petty aversion to having the Catholic Church as an ally. This strange assertion will come as news to many, including Theda Skocpol, author of the most comprehensive study on the failure of the Clinton health care proposal. Elsewhere, Professor Jenkins explores the pedigree of anti-Catholic prejudice in America in depth, but he fails to do the same for Vatican hostility to the United States which has a long pedigree of its own. Despite the good feelings towards the Catholic Church in the United States at independence (due in part to French aid against the British) and the disestablishment of Protestant churches, the Vatican regarded the U.S. "as the bastard brat of Jacobinism" (to quote Samuel Eliot Morison) and warned against the heresy of "Americanism". This hostility persisted right up until the papacy of John XXIII. Also, during the 19th century, the Vatican made no bones about its opposition to freedom of religion, freedom of thought, and freedom of conscience. This hostility persisted right up until the Second Vatican Council. Unfortunately, while none of the Vatican II reforms have been formally rescinded during the papacy of John Paul II, they now seem to be as much a dead letter as the splendid list of rights embalmed in the old Soviet constitution.   Nevertheless, it is deplorable that Roman Catholics have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in actions this book indisputably documents. Such treatment deserves condemnation wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others that endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. But the proper reaction to outrages committed against Catholics should not be to claim that all who take a critical view of the church are motivated by prejudice. There is an immense and inordinate effort by the Vatican in some countries (e.g., Poland, Italy, the United States) to manipulate civil-statutes and to have its doctrines written into the secular law. Even when the Vatican's efforts may seriously threaten the lives and well being of a large number of people, (as in attempts to hamstring public health efforts against sexually transmitted disease) its advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks involved. Although the authoritarian inclination of the Church is not a crime, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered towards clericalism; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective threat to a democratic polity. When the Church seeks to illegitimately extend its power in democratic societies, or when civil legislation is introduced to confer privileges to which no one denomination has any conceivable right, neither the Vatican nor Professor Jenkins should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground, and irrational and violent reactions increase. Therefore special concern and attention should be directed toward those who have this inclination, lest they be led to believe that the subversion of the U.S. Constitution is a morally acceptable option. It is not.   With all this in mind, decent Catholics should ask their Bishops to be especially cautious of any programs that may seek to pressure American law and society to abrogate the rights of any citizens, even while claiming not to do so. A careful examination of the public statements and the activities conservative Catholic pressure groups promote reveals a blatant duplicity by which they attempt to mislead Catholics and the general public alike. For example, they may present the teaching of the Magisterium as if it were the mandatory source for all secular laws. Its specific authority is held to be binding on the entire society. Some of these groups will use the word "democratic" to describe either the organization or its intended actions, yet they do not defend and promote the interests of American society; indeed, they even openly attack it. Those within the Church who argue in this fashion often have close ties with those with similar views outside it. These latter groups are guided by a vision bitterly opposed to American liberty and pluralism. They reflect, even if not entirely consciously, a 'sacral state' ideology that denies the democratic nature of the United States, as well as the rights of every individual. This does not mean that conservative Catholics are not generous and giving of themselves on occasion, but when they engage in seditious activity against fellow citizens, they confirm within themselves a disordered political inclination that is essentially self-indulgent.   Jesus promised, "You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free" (Jn. 8:32). Conservative Catholics (including the hierarchy here and in the Vatican) should have the truth about American society and its secular democratic culture clearly explained to them so they will stop denigrating it so incessantly. After all, without the defeat of Nazism and U.S. opposition to Soviet communism, the young Karol Wojtyla might well have been shot in a secret police cellar instead of going on to become pontiff. There has never been a society in human history that afforded so many--Catholics included--the opportunity to practice their religion so freely as the United States. However, Catholics must be trustworthy custodians of other's freedoms as well as their own. Perhaps Professor Jenkins's next book can take up this challenge 
 This book is entirely misleading. Paul Johnson employs one of the dirtiest tricks known to humanity and very common in the political world - he picks a triple handful of intellectuals he doesn't like or disagrees with and digs up the darkest or absurdest material about them he can find.  I would have been a bit more impressed if he had chosen intellects or historical figures he revered and subjected them to the same dirty treatment.  Where are Mr. Johnson's favorite writers, popes, theologians, political philosophers and what all.  But it still would've been a mugs game and not worth much more beyond entertainment value except, perhaps, to affirm what all mature readers ought to know by now - we are all sinners.  Big deal.  Welcome to the real world, folks. Mr. Johnson does a singular disservice by his idiosyncratic use of the word "intellectual" by which he can push forward his smear campagain against intellectuals whose ideas bother him and white wash intellectuals he approves of. His treatment of Evelyn Waugh is absurd.  Mr. Waugh, contra Mr. Johnson, was most definitely an intellectual and he had his own ideas about how the world should be run.  Mr. Johnson does not take seriously Waugh's roster of sins which include an almost overbearing arrogance, the basic innability to admit when he was wrong, discourteousy to friend and foe alike, and a callous and ostentatious flaunting of wealth which would have won him the censure of the writer of the Epistle of James. I'll give Mr. Johnson's tabloid journalism two stars instead of one because it does have its entertainment value. Mere entertainment always has charm especially when wisdom is lacking 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 I expected a lot from this CD, but was really disappointed.  Midon feels a bit one-dimensional and I'd agree that there isn't much to "hook" a listener.   A few good songs, and a good listen or two, but not much to bring you back.  
 When I first installed the program I was able to access the images, but since that first time I haven't. My operating system is XP and I don't know if that is the problem with the software. I have since then uninstalled it. I did not think this product was very easy to use

 Let me start with my bias. If you share it, then this review will be helpful, otherwise skip it and read the others.  I like swing music from the 40's and 50's. I prefer that old style of playing and recording; for me new swing records typically lack a sense of soul and character. I think the reason for this is because back in those previous decades swing was still new, people were innovating. Nowadays, most (not all) swing stuff is merely preserving the genre, so it lacks a certain edge to my ears.  Martinis and Mistletoe is a relatively new recording (2002). The songs are played very well, the recording is everything you would expect from something recorded with all the new technology: well balanced, clear and full. The band is solid and clearly does a good job with all of the numbers performed. The singers are pretty good, depending on the song. It is not a bad album by any standard.  All that said, I don't really like this CD and will not be keeping it in my Christmas album rotation. Again, that's because I have a bias for older recordings. If you are of the same mindset, keep looking for other recordings.   An alternate I suggest is Swingin' Christmas Party. This one has the exact feel that I look for...  Cheers,   
 I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this.  I just don't get it.  The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry.   
 DO NOT BUY!!! Great movie bad studio!! It has been announced that NEW LINE is replacing Peter Jackson as the director of The Hobbit. The only way to stop this injustice is to hit them were it hurts the wallet. Do not buy or see anything New Line till The Hobbit is returned to its rightful director!!! 
 I was disappointed when reading this DIY paint book.  While it does provide some background on paint, spray guns, techniques, tools, and painting, it lacks depth in any of these areas.  Seems each chapter is really a high level view, but reading the author's background, he could have put more detail in the book 
 Not a Christian myself, I was nevertheless attracted by the title.  Having long been fed up by my perception over the years of the increased failure by politicians to make moral decisions when legislating, my "to be read" shelves are becoming populated with political commentary.  This is one of the first I chose to read.  The main thrust of the book is that  -- Christ advocated the use of government to address social issues, such as poverty; -- the Religious Right has allied itself with the party least likely to offer serious relief of either the symptoms or causes of poverty; -- both Democrats and Republicans are coalitions of certain groups, and neither party exhibits a consistent moral philosophy; -- Christian ministers should discuss and promote political actions consistent with Jesus' ministry, as they have been a primary source for change in the past (witness the civil rights movement, and other church-based activity in our history).  Unfortunately, there was little to offer a non-Christian. The author acknowledges that Christians do not have a monopoly on morality, however the basis of each of his arguments is in Christian scripture, and he fails to discuss any other moral or spiritual justifications for those arguments.  My biggest problem with the book is that it offers no solutions the average citizen can take to bring God or morality into politics.  This lengthy sermon seems aimed at other Christian ministers.  Even for them, it is weak on concrete action points.    Additional failures are: 1)  The author does come off as too prideful.  This book is a great testament to all he has done to further his causes.   2)  Much of the power of what the author offers is diluted by the repetition throughout.  Wallis states and restates many points time and time again.  This book could have been much more concise and to the point (something that could be said about much of my own writing... hehe), maybe 1/3 or 1/4 the length.   3)  He makes some seriously startling accusations about the balance of political power in this country.  I think many of his accusations are plausible, but he fails to provide good evidence for them.  He then proceeds directly to what is wrong with the behavior of those he has mentally tried and found guilty, and what the moral choice would have been 
 I ordered this book and eventually amazon cancelled the order because it was not available.  The then ask me to review it?  Where is it?  Rev bruce 
 I've read all 6 of the books, I think they're great!  But why would you spend $100 on a 6 book box set... when there are 7 books in the series?  Better to hold off on buying the box set until is a... complete set.  But maybe that's just me.    2 Stars because the books are incredible 
 Never received goods, contacted MULTIPLE TIMES, finally went to another seller and received merchandise promptly from them 
 Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.  Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him   advice.  Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).  The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.  It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.  See the movie 
 The only good thing in this movie is Jolene Blalock as a femme fetale. The problem with this film, to paraphrase an old quote, is that there is a lot of nice scenery but no engaging story put in front of it.  Truly only Wilbur Smoth knows how to pull off South African Grand Guignol and have you care. Unfortunately Wilbur Smith has nothing to do with this. And it shows 
 What I have come to expect of Rhino is thoroughness, and this CD certainly is not thorough, although what is here is of course done very well. Where are the hits Half the Way,Why have you left the one you left me for, etc?  I think this could have been a great collection if made longer, or possibly even a two CD set, although maybe they figured nobody would spring for that......too bad, it remains a "couldve been great"..... 
 I appreciate the effort. I really do. Especially from a woman filmmaker on a tight budget. I applaud the movie for that reason only. 1 star for effort!  But, honestly, aren't there any decent scripts and actors out there? Isn't there anyone willing to invest money in lesbian films? We are STARVED for anything half way decent, and will shell out some bucks on Amazon to get it. But I refuse to part with hard earned cash for something on par with the very bad "Bar Girls," which describes this movie to a T.  Unfortunately, this film gets one star from me because (a) it was completely unbelievable, (b) the pacing was terrible, (c) the acting was energetic, but not in the right places, and (d) I was bored.  A MUCH better low budget/made by women film is "Kissing Jessica Stein." Even "Go Fish" gets points for style (and 2 stars from me, although it DID have worse acting). Back to the drawing board! And don't ask for my money until you have something at "It's in the Water"-level or better 
 This book has basically ruined my life. I no longer will hold to a man's standard just because he wrote a book about his personal experiences. Very old fashioned. This book does not apply to the general population of people who are Christian. This book is not recommended for people 21 and up. This is basically a childish, immature kind of book only meant for youths. Zero stars 
 You're led to believe that these are the full-length hits when you play them, but DONT BE FOOLED!!  They are chopped up shortened versions of the original hits!!  FAME by David Bowie has about 2 min taken out, and the great guitar riff at the end of the Lynard Skynard "Freebird" tune is chopped off at the end . .A RIP OFF!! 
 I agree with the comments about the taste and size.  Personally I think someone should look into the false advertising.  On the preztel kit, which is also a "4 pack", you only get two pretzels.  One of the packs is salt and another is glaze.  Then you get two packs of some pretzel dough.  These pretzels are not much larger than the ones you get in a bag out of the vending machine.  Total rip-off.  Hasbro should be ashamed of its marketing staff 
 A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.  So why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made possible by this book.  Part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of the coming Armageddon look downright trendy.  However, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.: Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.  Between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the Left Behind series of novels.  If you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie A Thief in the Night.  However, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely worthless.  
 I personally started liking Tim Robbins from Shawshank Redemption & Sean Penn from Dead Man Walking and I believe these were the movies these guys should have recieved oscar for their outstanding roles.  Keeping than in mind and seeing lot of recommendations I saw Mystic River which the review said was the best as far as Clint Eastwood was concerned Again he had adapted another movie, Bridges of Madison County, which in my personal opinion was much better adaptation of a novel.  The story line eventhough is good about three friends meeting again by fate and all the script is not that strong. I actually fell asleep in between. Off the cast my personal belief is Kevin Bacon was really good. Sure Tim  Robbins plays a character of sexually abused child with lot of conviction but even that was potrayed better in Shawshank Redemption where he is abused by a few inmates. And the end is kind of loose.  Give it a mis 
 Senator Obama is an engaging speaker and has potential to be a leader, but this book doesn't offer any new insights or solutions to the political climate we have today in the USA.  Nicely written but the next book will tell whether he can avoid the decline into standard partisan behavior now that the Dems are in charge of Congress.  Time will tell 
 The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful. JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.  But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound 
 In a very convoluted plot, Harvard professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and cryptologist Sophie Neveu(Audrey Tautou) are chased through the streets of Paris and London by the French police and a crazed religious fanatic named Silas. It's your typical Hollywood action-thriller in most respects. Yes, it's silly and unrealistic. But if that's all there were to it I might go along with the "it's only a movie" argument.   Unfortunately, this movie is also full of ideas, ridiculous ideas that run counter to the historical facts. As an atheist, I certainly have no problem that the movie brings up some of the darker moments in Christian history. For example, the Inquisition, the witch burnings and the Crusades are all mentioned. Yet these actual historical events are only brushed over. Instead the movie focuses on making up some bizarre conspiracy theory that the Catholic Church is involved in a grand cover-up to prevent the public from knowing the truth about Christianity. For example, it states that not only were Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had children but that their bloodline has continued to the present day. They also portray a secret Catholic society that is involved in murder plots, strange sexual rituals and all manner of evil activities. It's completely fair to challenge the Church on its grave errors. For example, the shameful Inquisition involved the murder and tortue of many innocent people. I also disagree with the Vatican's present opposition to legal abortion and birth control. However, the sort of ridiculous conspiracy theory that this movie suggests is the worst sort of anti-Catholic bigotry. It's also dangerous to society as a whole as demonstrated by how similar lies and falsehoods have been historically used against Jews to justify brutal acts of anti-Semitism, including the Holocaust. No, I don't think it's likely that the "Da Vinci Code" will lead to the mass execution of Catholics. But any time a particular group is scapegoated it's a potential source of trouble.   Basically, "The Da Vinci Code" is a bunch of mumbo jumbo, distorted information and flat out lies that are not supported by the evidence. But, unfortunately, as P.T. Barnum said, "there's a sucker born every minute," and some people are going to believe this nonsense. History is a complex subject and I have no respect for people, whether they be the book's writer, Dan Brown, or the film's director, Ron Howard, who play fast and loose with the truth in order to make a buck. This is garbage. Don't waste your time 
 I've always been a fan of kung fu and have always found it to be an effective fighting art.  But some of the stuff in this book is quite questionable.  The pictures are practically useless as all that is shown are flicky kicks that could never harm a tough opponent and useless punches  that prolly woldn't have great efeect, that is, even if they hit.  The stances shown are laughable.  How easy it is to get taken down in one of those stances is ludicrous and the power behind your stances will leave something to be desired.  Every stance that is built for speed lacks power and every stance built for power lacks speed.  You'll find some useful information in the book and some interesting background, but if it's realistic training you want, I suggest you look elsewhere 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 Gosh, I'd hate to be a student in a Wong classroom. Wong's book is an endeavor in positivistic manipulation, a recipe guide aimed at reproducing good little consumers who never question the authority figures in the Foucauldian nightmare world Wong and his fellow behaviorists have conjured. What Wong does not seem to realize is the children he obviously sees as objects in need of control and manipulation are going to be adults with little capacity for critical thought and decision making after 13 years of suffocation in any school under the thrall of the Wong way. Add the fact that the "practical" tips in the book are completely useless in 99 percent of the public school classrooms, and the Wong book is not only a waste of money, but a real danger to students subject to teachers sucked in by Wong's platitudes 
 I bought this because I was so glad to finally see a book about the God, but this book is a farce.  Wicca is a religion that says, "All gods are one god," etc. and we are supposed to be supportive of other people's religions.  So what right does Conway have to bash the Christian god and say that he is not real???  She says her book is about "the true god."  Isn't that what the Christians say, that theirs is the only true god?  How is what Conway says any different, and yet she bashes the Christians!  I am glad to see this book out of print and hope it stays that way.  Janet and Stewart Farrar's book The Witches' God is so much better 
 I don't recall ever being quite as disappointed with a product as I am with the Swing Groover II. Last night I went to the driving range to check some yardages of my clubs, just so I could verify the accuracy of the Swing Groover.       I was hitting my 5-iron between 180-190 yards most of the time, occasionally hitting 200. My 7-iron was flying about 165 yards. Tonight, I just finished setting up the Swing Groover. My first few swings with a 5-iron produced readings of 133 yards. I warmed up a little more and started hitting the 7-iron. These swings produced readings of 121 yards, with an average of 121.      This product is designed to indicate swing speed and yardage hit. The yardage is off by about 50 yards, but believe it or not, I think the swing speed indicator is probably pretty accurate. With the 5-iron, it was indicating a little over 70 mph. I've had my speed tested before with the driver and it registered a little over 100 mph, so this number of 71-73 with the 5-iron sounds reasonable.       I'm not sure if I just got a defective machine or what exactly the problem is, but I'm very disappointed. I'm very inclined to think I just wasted $150.      My suggestion is to keep looking for other products, because this one is horribly inaccurate 
 Japan imported diversity when it brought in Koreans pre-war, and then, in the era of 'developed Japan', when it brought in workers from all over Asia and Latin America. The JET Programme mostly imported well intentioned middle class young people who brought inevitably brought cultural and political pabulum from the anglophone world in an attempt to shore up English education, and when that failed, the people running the programme turned it into one big 'cross-cultural' exchange between essentially middle class westerners and middle class Japanese, with the Japanese taxpayer footing the bill.  Now a warning. Most books about Japan do the following: (1) they emphasize how EXOTIC Japan is, (2) they emphasize how MESSED UP Japan is, and (3) they reduce Japan to a monomaniacal thesis so westerners who don't know any better can think they learned something.  I won't say that this book suffers from number 3, but numbers 1 and 2 are pretty well covered.   This book isn't really very informative if you have been on the programme, and it isn't going to be of much use for those going on the programme (better to get a hold of real Jet people on the web and at sites like ELT News). 
 I got this book for undergrad because it had a perfect score back then and I needed something to help explain my required textbook. I admit it helped to a certain extent but not by much! However, in grad school it didn't really tell me anything new. The author I think over explains things, which depending on the subject in quantum can be needed but often times can be boring! While this author does try and explain a lot and I can't fault him for that this book gets a low rating because it fell apart on me in the middle of the semester and it fell apart on my fellow students too! Be forwarned that if you buy this book chances are pretty good that it will fall apart on you too! So while it may have a good intro and stuff this book is just destine to break apart. In retrospect, giving this book 2 stars may be generous 
  OK Im not a great pizza maker. I donot know what went wrong, but my top portion of the pizza browned but botton crust was not cooked properly. I cooked it in a pan on stove, after taking it out from the oven 
 After taking a long, considered look at the reviewvs available for "From Here to Etrenity," I noticed that many of them were giving 4/5 stars to the book.  Which then made me consider.  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?  This was undoubtedly the worst book ever created.  It is considered a WWII novel, and yet there's only one chapter of combat in it, which doesn't even contain any honest-to-god fight.   Pearl Harbor was not considered a battle.  It was considered a massacre.    As I read this book, I could not help from falling asleep.  The few times I was awake, however, a strong passion to burn this filth raged like a fire within me.  How can anyone cosider this book decent.  All it is is getting drunk, going to a whore-house, getting caught, and then doing the same thing over and over again until either killed, arrested, or moved to a different continent.  The main character, Robert E. Lee Prewitt(called Prew by many), dies about 150 pages from the book's ending!    Ladies, and gentlemen, as I conclude this review, I ask you one thing.  Do not buy this book, and most surely do not read it.  Reading " From Here to Eternity" is like chewing on broken glass, except 100 times less fun. 
 I read the entire book. That in itself keeps it from getting the worse review of one star, reserved for books so horrible I can't even finish but that is pretty much the only compliment I can give this book. This is the second Laymon book I have read (the first was Traveling Vampire Show) and his writing, to put it simply, just isn't that good. In the two books I have read it takes forever for anything worth while to happen and the dialouge is really bad. Also, I get this creepy oversexed old man feelings from his writing. It seems like he gets his rocks off writing ON EVERY PAGE about what sex thoughts the characters are thinking. Sex in a book is no big deal but do I need to read throughout the book that when a person moves "their skirt climbed up and I can see their skin....ohh man it's so nice and I am sooo hot".... That's basically the jist of his writing right there. None of the characters were particularly likable and I really didn't care or have any emotion invested in the ending at all, which ended pretty cheesy in my opinion. I put this guy in the same category I put Bently Little, the hack category. I am sure high school kids who haven't read much in their lives get kicks out of the 'naughty' writing and predictable events in the book but I think I'll go back to real suspense, horror and sci-fi authors like Philip Dick, Straub, F. Paul Wilson, CHUCK PALAHNIUK, BRET EASTON ELLIS, H. P. Lovecraft, Bradbury, Dan Simmons, McCammon and others rather than this junk. I advise you to do the same 
 As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher "Finnegans Wake" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.  I first tried reading "Finnegans Wake" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.  However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Dumas, "Les Miserables" by Hugo, "War and Peace" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, "Notes From the Underground," "Crime and Punishment,"  and "The Brothers Karamazov." These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.   In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.   Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. "Growth of the Soil", by Knut Hamsun, and "The Master and Margarita," by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over "Finnegans Wake" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as "Finnegans Wake" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece 
 I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like "The gun was loaded, and so was I".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.  But one more stinker like this one and I'll drop his name from my reading list 
 This book is not a how to, it's a 143 pages of telling you that you should only buy West Coast Choppers parts and a list of other high dollar parts from suppliers.It tells a little about paint prep, but nothing about the things a person will encounter building a bike.Nothing what so ever, read this and you will think lay the parts on the floor and they will just jump into one piece. Wow,this is BS! Watch the bike build shows on TV and get 100 times more info.This was publish to take atvantage of the jump on the Jesse train. I would love to hear his true thoughts. Don't waste your money 
 This book just drags on and on.  Buck's search for Chloe could have been handled in a fraction of the time.  One huge gripe, which represents incredibly poor writing, is the name changes used to refer to one character.  Ken Ritz is both referred to as Ken and Ritz, and not just in dialogue either.  One rule of good writing is to ALWAYS refer to your character by one name.  You wouldn't refer to a mother as Jane, mum, mother and ma in the one book.  Still, the book can be quite entertaining if you know what's coming next, which you would because it's been mentioned enough in the books.  One more thing that bothers me is recapping on past events-- the authors rehash the same old stuff 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 I was surprised that the authors used such a significant amount of material from Atul Nerkar.  He has been widely discredited given his unorthodox teachings at Columbia, and few if any of his peers have bought into his lines of reasoning.  While some of the material in the book was thoughtfully presented, one must question the author's judgment in drawing upon sources such as Nerkar 
  This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.  
 There are 8 sides of tape. Yet there is no Table of Contents and the tapes are not organized by topic. You need to listen to them as though they comprised a novel. It is so difficult to navigate to the topics you wish to  listen that these tapes are a waste of time and money 
 I've read scores of books about photo history and criticism but have rarely encountered such an unbearable load of relentlessly  postmodernist-deconstructionist-postcolonialist-genderbending cultural theory.  Certainly there is room for such perspectives and they may provide certain insights into certain photographic subject matter.  I welcome and applaud such efforts when they are well done.  But please, if occasionally a cigar is just a cigar, can't the same be true of a humble photograph?  Alas, no.  At least not to Clarke, who sees every photo as built on a foundation of past political incorrectness, which he proceeds to survey like an archeologist examining the strata of a Pompein latrine.  Viewing what purports to be the entirety of the history of photography in this monocular manner leaves us in this case with no history of photography at all.. 
 I just bought the Krups espresso machine at costco yesterday and the carafe breaks on me. Its super fragile but i don't have a choice but to replace it. The machine sucks and its kind of dangerous. If i could return this machine and blow 600 dollars on a seaco automatic espresso machine...i would. 
 This book is lacking for sensible sturcture. Seems to put a reader into a maze and leaves them wondering where there at. There are enough topics but their too full of proofs to really understand what the book is trying to explain. This book would even be diffucult for a graduate student that's using it for review. The author seems to be proving his mathematical talent instead of trying to explain the topics in a manor that's understandable to the average reader 
 Coming out is not an excuse to make poor movies like this one,it is slow nad ok when You are 20, but other then that is not really whort it, if You haven seen it, dont worry

 Of the five DVD's in the set, all five were defective.  Two had video dropouts through much of the disk, and the remainder would show some problems and then skip over large parts of the program.  They had to be returned as defective.  This happened on two good DVD players 
 Forget Summers, Father Satan has already dealt with him and all those hypocritical fools who thought they could play around with the demons, hold them in chains, and embarrass them. The demons are free now and anyone who wants to follow Montague Summers can join him in Satan's personal chamber of torment. That is his price to pay for agreeing with all those witchburnings, hahaha. I'm glad he's dead. May he suffer in Hell 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 As to the best of my knowledge, there were two major intellectual responses to the seemingly endless and insuperable crisis which the capitalist system had got itself into after the Great Slump of 1929: Keynes`s "General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment" of 1936 and Schumpeter`s "Capitalism" which was first published in 1942. Like Marx before them, both Keynes and Schumpeter reject the "classic economists'" contention that what they called the market system wll always automatically swing back to an ideal equilibrium - expecially one that implied full employment - provided only the state kept its hands off as much as possible.   However, that is just about where their concurrence ends. While Marx sees the only solution outside the system, in its bloody overthrow and its succession by a "dictatorship of the proletariat" introducing the next evolutionary step in human history, called socialism, Keynes considered the market system as basically viable. All that was needed, according to him, was governmental involvement by which the lacking demand in times of a slump would be lifted to more agreeable levels. Schumpeter, in contrast, agrees with Marx in that capitalism's days are counted and that it is about to be replaced by socialism, even though he doesn't share Marx`s more aggressive notions: according to him, the present day capitalists need not be dealt with by the guillotine alone, they may indeed have a useful function as entrepreneurs employed by his envisaged omnipotent and omniscient super agency that will ideally plan everybody's well-being in his imagined socialist system.  What to think of the book today? First, it is hard to fathom how Schumpeter could have turned such an absolutely blind eye on the totalitarian tendencies necessarily inherent in a state that not only controlled the political field but also was quasi the monopolist employer and as such responsible for the economic side of peoples's lives as well, in particular when one considers the time when it came out: 1942! Second, it is a fine example of how wrong you can get things even if (or: because?) you know so much as Schumpeter did - maybe that is the best argument of all against the establishment of such a super agency planning everybody's life to the extent envisaged by Schumpeter. Finally, even if such an agency did not err - is it not a basic right - and half of the fun of life - to make mistakes - for oneself that is, not forcing them on others

 Who are these editors?  How long have they been business?  I'm a travel writer published in many publiscation and I never use this book for fact-finding for my articles.  I think the internet is more reliable and accurate.  With 1 travel book to my name, I have found everything for it on the internet.   
 I did not find these pillows comfortable for airplane travel. They are too big and bulky to provide any comfort. I guess they would be fine if you were laying on a couch and not sitting mostly upright like on a plane. I would have been better off saving my money and using the airplane pillow. I wouldn't recommend these particular pillows 
 This is at best an amusing coffee table book, so why does it call itself "The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time?"  Surely such a title alludes to the musical contributions of the albums - not necessarily if they are pet favorites of some, even famous, rock critics.  The problem was the method.  Ask a hundred rock critics to compile a list of the greatest albums and they will list either what they feel they should list to stay hip with readers or what they personally loved the most.  Recipe for disaster.  Bias multiplied by a hundred.  In short, you get a massive hodge-podge of personal bests, not necessarily an historical evaluation of which records were the most important.  Thus, a dumbing down occurs, rather than a serious analysis of the best music from the past half century.    That is exactly what happened with the 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time.  It works fine as a glamorous exposition of albums that sold well in their time and are favorites of their fans (the contributing critics), but not as a serious list of what really constitutes on a musical level (that is, minus the hype) the greatest albums.  Which is a great shame, since compiling a list of the "500 Greatest Albums Of All Time" ordinarily invites such a selectiveness.    Isn't the whole fun and point in creating a list like this to be able to argue: "surely we have to put Dylan before the Beatles as Lennon's more interesting lyrics were influenced by him, and also because the Beatles wrote meaningless ditties compared to Dylan's poetic commentaries?"  "Sure, but then if we consider Sgt. Pepper important for its use of the studio, then we must place Pet Sounds before it since its experimental use of the studio inspired McCartney to produce this Beatles album with Geroge Martin's innovative recording techniques?"  And so on and so forth.  Thus, the criteria in creating such a list must be to what extent the album was ahead of its time, influencing others, or daring to do something with music that had not yet been dared, trying very hard to stay on that level and not stoop to the temptation of including albums merely for their sales or fame (and let's be honest, these critics are partly responsible along with the label's marketing staff and budget, for an album's hype anyway).  I am not about to use some examples merely to whine and complain about personal favorites, but rather to support and illustrate my hypothesis.  Highly innovative musicians whose styles were extremely original and who influenced modern rock are glaringly missing.  For example, no Nico.  It is true that the average rock listener may not even know who Nico was, but her dazzling originality on an album such as Desert Shore has influenced thousands of modern Alternative artists.  I can't even think of another artist from the era of Desert Shore or Marble Index that produced a sound as unique as hers.  Another extremely glaring ommission - no Robert Wyatt.  Hard to imagine a greater musical genius in rock loved more by other artists and music lovers - both in Soft Machine (a band that along with early Pink Floyd were extremely experimental and innovative in the English scene) and in his solo career with an album such as Rock Bottom that is probably one of the most accomplished rock albums of all time.  Such an album is certainly "greater" than this book's #1 album, Sgt. Pepper, since that Beatles album was inspired by an already thriving psychedelic scene that that band did not create nor was even part of, even though, yes, that album may have been the scene's best seller and its most famous.  This is where sales and hype constitute two variables that tend to take first place to musical importance in this book.  Another extraordinarily original artist in rock music was Tim Buckley whose Lorca and Starsailor are among the most original albums of popular music ever created, both  missing in this book's list.    The Krautrock bands like Faust, Can, Neu!, Popol Vuh, or Amon Duul were each extraordinarily original for their time, and influenced almost every pop genre that followed them (from punk to progressive to modern alternative) - but they are not even listed once, despite their huge contribution!    You see the problem?  By listing almost every Beatles album, for example, when only about 2 were truly original works (Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road, for their use of sounds, medleys, mixes, instruments and the studio itself) places are wasted for other important selections.  It is incredible to see no Pere Ubu among early punk influences - the Modern Dance for instance.  If you don't believe me, this is what Wikipedia says about Pere Ubu: "they have been hugely influential on several generations of forward-thinking musicians and are among the most critically acclaimed American musical groups."  You will find a similar determination of greatness if you do research on Wikipedia or in rock history books on any of the other artists I mentioned, and there are dozens more I did not list.  For instance, how come no John Fahey, no Red Crayola, and why, among modern artists, no Lisa Germano, one of the most original from the 1990s?  You must all be acquainted with the influence of Asian instruments and sounds in the rock music of the 1960s, and the departure from the short ditties of the early 1960s (e.g., the Beatles' Love Me Do and Please Please Me) to the extended, raga-ish works of the middle to late '60s, as rock matured, gobbling up not only so-called World Music but also the improvisational quality of jazz?  By that estimation, early musicians such as Robbie Basho and Sandy Bull were early geniuses showing rock the way with their accoustic instrumentalism.  And, of course, you would not even know it from this book.  Do any of you know what geniuses a band such as the Vampire Rodents were?  They combined metal, melodic rock, punk, jazz and even classical in their highly original albums.  Their sound was so unique and creative at least one of their albums should rank among the greatest of all time?  There are tons of artists like this from the 1980s to the present day that are completing missing from this book, yet deserve a mention when you have 500 titles to include.  What about extremely hyped artists like Radiohead, Elvis Presley and U2?  Should they be listed at all compared with the true trailblazers?  Controversial, well that is what modern popular music is supposed to be.  It is supposed to be about novelty, experimentation, risk, passion, inventiveness, no?   This book does not even scratch the surface of such a discussion, it does not even provide intelligent commentary from one album to the next, and so while it might provide entertainment, it simply does not live up to its name.  This does not mean I think you should not be in possession of it - there is a place for fluffy coffee-table books, after all, the coffee table!  It simply means it is not a real collection of the greatest albums of rock as the title implies, so don't be fooled if you are interested in discovering great modern music.  On the other hand, you will only learn by developing a vast library like me, with some works more useful than others, until you can form your own opinions.  I would say that every album in this book is worth listening to at least once, so the book is not completely useless.  But if you do listen to some of these, don't let it be said I did not warn you!!  This book may have some sociological significance as a work reflecting the influence of sales and hype upon rock critics.  But for a serious appreciation of the greatest albums, do not look into this tome or you will be greatly disappointed (although obviously many classics are included, inevitably).  It is not surprising that this list was published by Rolling Stone, a journal that has not been cutting edge since the 1960s.  It appears to be simply clueless.  This rolling stone grew moss a long time ago 
 As a fellow bird lover, I thought I'd get a lot out of this book.  I didn't.  After wading through the first chapter or two, I gave up.   Chester writes about his life with a pet sparrow. But mostly, Chester writes about Chester.  In the first part of the book I learned more than I care to know about him. I learned that he is totally self-absorbed, that he likes to use big words when small ones would do, that he suffers from depression, that he is an atheist -- almost militantly so -- and that he thinks people who go to church are misguided idiots. I learned nothing at all about the bird; not how he ended up with Chester, not what he does, not how he behaves. Only how his behavior affects Chester and Chester's sense of well-being.  After giving up on a linear read, I took to a scheme of book lottery, jumping to sections at random.  I hoped that, eventually, I'd learn something about the bird.  I didn't. Every single time, I just read more introspection from Chester, about Chester.  A big disappointment.  If it's a toy Chester needs, he should stick to squeeze toys, and leave the birds to someone who truly loves them 
 This book, up to the very end was very good. With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half.  The end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud!  This story is not really horror, its SiFi. A adventure/drama/SiFi. It really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. Everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed. And somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. The writting was dead on as always and character development was good.  This book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book 
 Why do I get the feeling that some of these later reviews were written by Kensington people? The fact is, this light has some unique features that most USB lights don't, including an On/Off switch and two brightness levels. However, that doesn't come close to overcoming the drawbacks.  First of all, the price is way too high for what you are getting. Also, the brightness difference between four and eight LEDs is negligible. But the biggest flaw in this light, by far, is that the flexible arm is not NEARLY strong enough to support the weight of the lamp. I have had to resort to clamping the arm to the side of my monitor, which is just plain ridiculous. For the price they are getting, they should have produced a more durable product 
 The author displays an alarming lack of understanding of European history and Christianity (especially Catholic Christianity.) He uses several negative assumptions about Christianity, some of them easily disproven with a little research, to compare it unfavorably with Islam. Simultaneously, he promotes, throughout the book, his own relativistic and pluralistic value system which ultimately holds nothing to be objectively true 
 Yeah i read the reviews on how great this album is. Dont get me wrong its unique but that doesnt mean im gonna feel it. Im sure some underground head is gonna read this and trip and write a review dissin me. So let me tell you there is just as much fake ass artists in the underground as mainstream. So dont discriminate mainstream and underground. Give mainstream a chance. You might like it. I dont even talk about whats what anymore. I like Outkast, The Game, and some G Unit that doesnt make me a "a non true hip hop head". Oh yeah back to the album. I really didnt like it cuz it was borin and left me thinking about other things. Im mad that i bought this cd. I will give him a 2 star for effort though. Heed my words majority kids 
 I'm a professional mehndi artist, and I own a good many of these patterns already.  The book is just black and white patterns....and very minimal colour photos and such.  Many of these patterns were taken from some original Indian books that I already own, by Navneet publishing.  I  recommend buying the Navneet books over this one.  If you are a novice,  pass it up too 
 ENCRYPTED MUSIC TAKES AWAY OUR RIGHTS AS AMERICAN CITIZENS. STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND DON'T BUY THIS ARTISTS MUSIC! 
 I had to read this book for a college course, sorry to say.  Otherwise, trust me, I wouldn't have gotten through this entire mess.  The authors have about three common sense points to make and take about 100 pages to  make each of those points.  I'd like to know what qualifies them to write  this book anyways.  Bottom line is it's a complete waste of time 
 Like a permanent wedgie, these kept riding up my crack.  I don't recommend these at all...the liquid metallic look is only useful if you're going to be a male stripper.  Otherwise, you've got liquid metal up your crack...not very appealing 
 I regret to inform that Anne Rice has been reduced from an open minded author with original ideas, to a narrow minded christian.  This book will be interesting for: * those who have never read or heard about the time period Jesus grew up * christians and other book-religious people  Otherwise, nothing really interesting happens in this book. At least for people who have been exposed to more than a bible.  I'm sorry to lose such a great author to the, in my opinion, real dark side. I give it 2 stars for the research work, 0 for the story.  Sorry, Anne Rice. I will still read your old book 
 Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. 
 I'm a fan of Barrow's, but this book is repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. It's a collection of pieces he did for various publications and everything in it is said more clearly in Impossibility or Pi in  the Sky or  others of his stimulating books. Save  your money and buy one of those  rather than this  deflationary rehash 
 It looks like I bought this unit based on the very positive reviews only to come back and see the few less than positive reviews that are brand new. I've had this happen on several products now from Amazon - product has a lot of good reviews, I buy it and by the time I go back to review it there are several non-positve reviews. Makes you wonder if some are being written and scored by people involved with the products. Some of the review sound like sales pitches and brochures and I personally question if these are real consumers -  not that I necesssarily think that happened here.  I bought this unit to and just received in. So, far I am disappointed in it as well, but I'm not ready to throw in the towel with it yet.   The interface takes some getting used to, but I don't find it that horrible compared to others. Some GPS have excellent user interfaces, but most just seem average to below average and the X930 fits in there too. So, I would say its interface is just as bad as most are - there are only a few units with very good interfaces IMO.   The POI in this unit seem ridiculous. Michelin tries/wants/is/offers travel type services in general and I thought this unit would be packed with tons of accurate POIs (Points of Interest) - not really. Maybe I expected too much here but I think their POIs are dismal and very dismal if they are a travel services company. This unit should overflow with POI and again, its just about average. Though I will say again, there are onl a couple of very good GPS unit and then there is all the others, so this unit fits in with all the others IMO.   Its directions are not fabulous so far either.  Any route from my house actually has me drive a circle around my block.  I have not found any route from any point in my city where the "quickest" or "shortest" route is any different and I know of shortcuts.   It also wants to route you to the most major interstate and streets even if a less major put acceptable roadways are closer and shorter. For example, from my house to work it routes me 4 miles west to catch the north-south interstate to get me to the west-east interstate. There is a major road that gets me to the west-east interstate less than a mile to my east though. Shorter distance and quicker drive time.   Same on my work to home route - it routes me 5 miles past two major roadways in order to stay on the interstate - and it does this regardless of choosing "quickest" or "shortest". The interstate may be quickest with no traffic, but it is definately not shortest.   It does attempt to tell you what lane to be in on the interstate but its been the wrong lane for me about 50% of the time - 25% is due to outdated maps, 25% seems just wrong.   I've tried it for some in city driving where I already knew the routes and its routes did get me there, but were not the best or shortest route. I expect a GPS to actually return a shortest route when I ask for it. So far, all the directions I've selected - the shortest route and the quickest route are identical.   I am headed on a several hour drive in a couple of weeks and will see how it goes there.   Like the other reviewers, the speaker is ridiculous - at the out of the box volume level the speaker is distorted and crackly. Its not loud enough with windows open, vents on medium or with a carfull of conversation. Its adequate if you are concentrated on following its directions.   The screen itself is decent. I don't have a big glare issue and the unit responds to my commands ok. The mount is adjustable so glare can be avoided. The unit seems to respond quickly to commands.   I don't think this unit calculates routes or picks up your GPS position extremely quickly. It seems about average there too. I've used some other GPS and I would not say they are much better so maybe my expectation is too high. Again, there's the very high end and then everything else and this fits in with everything else.   Overall, I am disappointed but I may keep the unit because I need a GPS and I don't see one that seems much much better. Maybe my expectations are too high, but I don't think they are.   The MIOs, Garmins, Magellans, etc all have pros/cons and none seem to hit the target completely on price, function, accuracy, interface, etc. They all have their quirks and from playing with several the key items of speed and accuracy don't seem much different. I tried a friends MIO 310x and if I were to review it, my review would sound worse than the Michelin.  I've also used a Garmin 350 and other than perhaps the user interface, my review of it would not sound much different.   So this seems to be par for the course for the $200-$500 GPS - I did not look at higher priced units, because I'm just plain not interested then.  I was really only willing to spend up to $250 on one so my choices were cut down to just 3 units really anyway though I did review some of the $299, $399 and $499 sales units.   Up to $250 your choices are the MIO c310x, Michelin X-930 and a Nextar model. I don't think any one is appreciably better than the other so its a dart-shoot.   If your expectations are high and you need/want a GPS now with the low end price target then all 3 of these are about the same with their own set of quirks. If you don't need/want a GPS now then I would personally wait for the low end units to be improved. They are not worth it (nor do I think the higher priced models are) until they improve.  [...]. 
 So the truth was stated finally by William Dembski in this popular account explaining the origins and principles of "Intelligent Design"; in which he admits that there is  indeed a religious link to what he claims is primarily a scientific hypothesis (But a scientific hypothesis proposed originally by William Paley hundreds of years ago, which was rejected soundly by leading scientists afterwards.). There is nothing in this book which explains how science works, by careful observation and rigorous testing of ideas (hypotheses). Those ideas which are accepted through this rigorous scientific method are either incorporated within longstanding scientific theories, or may themselves be the incipient idea(s) of a new scientific theory which replaces an outmoded one (Most notably, in exactly the same manner that Einstein's Theory of General Relativy and the Theory of Quantum Mechanics replaced Newton's theories of physics, known now as classical mechanics; the latter are now subsumed within the two 20th Century theories forming the core of modern physics.). Dembski clearly doesn't understand how modern science works; he pretends to have such understanding via sloppy logic and intellectually dishonest statements which occur frequently throughout this book.  Intelligent Design is not scientific since it does not adhere to any of the long-established tenets about science itself (Intelligent Design has been judged correctly as the latest flavor of creationism enjoying some popularity amongst fundamentalist Protestant Christians; one notable biologist has referred to it as "reborn creationism".). It can not be tested, simply because it does not generate any testable hypotheses. Moreover, despite claims to the contrary, I have yet to see any peer-reviewed articles testing Intelligent Design; instead, every single book and article published in praise of this idea is merely an attack on the Modern Synthesis Theory of Evolution; this evolutionary theory is itself the central underlying theory for contemporary biology as much as General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are for contemporary physics (Any current scientific controversies about the Modern Synthesis are related to understanding the tempo and mode of evolution as seen from the fossil record and the relative importance of random genetic drift as the primary means of causing evolutionary change; they, themselves, do not mean that the Modern Synthesis is in trouble as the successful unifying theory it has been for nearly a century in explaining biological phenomena.). And Intelligent Design is not a new idea at odds with mainstream science, but rather the latest incarnation of an idea dating from the 17th Century regarding a "Great Chain of Being" which was subsequently tested - and rejected - by Enlightenment and later scientists, most notably naturalists, leading up to of course Darwin and Wallace, who almost simultaneously came up with the Theory of Evolution via Natural Selection (The Modern Synthesis Theory is its direct descendant, and includes its principles, as well as evidence from biological sciences as diverse as genetics, molecular biology and developmental biology, which were unknown to both Darwin and Wallace.).   The arguments presented by Dembski are not only intellectually dishonest, but now, irrelevant, as determined by Republican Federal Judge John Jones in his landmark, historic decision for the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Board of Education trial; Jones concluded that intelligent design is a religious doctrine masquerading as science (His decision is posted online at: htttp://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-12-20_kitzmiller_decision.pdf). Furthermore, thoughtful, reasonable conservatives like Charles Krauthammer and George Will have written lucid, brilliant columns praising the theory of evolution via natural selection, and condemning intelligent design for being an unscientific, religious doctrine.   There are other, more important - and intellectually sound - books available on the so-called "creation vs. evolution" controversy, which I regard as more worthy than any of Dembski's self-serving defenses of Intelligent Design. Philosopher Robert Pennock's "Tower of Babel" is a splendid historical overview and philosophical deconstruction of creationism, including the best written rebuke of "Intelligent Design" which I've come across (He also covers Dembski's "explanatory filter", and demolishes it too from a philosophical perspective.). Philip Kitcher, another philosopher, published "Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism" back in the early 1980s, but his arguments are still quite valid today. My friend Ken Miller's "Finding Darwin's God" has an eloquent critique of Intelligent Design, focusing on Michael Behe's mousetrap model of irreducible complexity which claims to bestow validity on Intelligent Design. Distinguished American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) invertebrate paleobiologist Niles Eldredge offers yet another brilliant critique of Intelligent Design in his book "Darwin: Discovering the Tree of Life", the elegant companion volume to the AMNH Darwin exhibition which he curated, soon to embark on a tour taking it to many of North America's and Great Britain's finest science museums. And last, but not least, Eugenie Scott, Executive Director, National Center for Science Education (www.ncseweb.org), has written a fine textbook on this issue, "Evolution vs. Creationism". All of these books are more desirable than Dembski's "Intelligent Design:The Bridge Between Science & Theology". Otherwise, if you insist on purchasing this book, then perhaps you might choose to acquire instead a splendid text devoted to Klingon cosmology (Neither Klingon cosmology nor "Intelligent Design" can be regarded as scientific, since both depend on faith, not reason, to validate their principles.). 
 I've read this book and it works if you use it but its nothing new.  If you want to save yourself some time from buying it drink water eat a well balanced meal, and exercise.  Everything Oprah touches turns to gold.  If only I could get 14.95 for my advice 
 It's clear that Mr. Goldberg is hurt by his personal and professional troubles with CBS and Dan Rather.  It is made even clearer by the fact that he constantly brings it up over and over again throughout most of this book.    This "book", for being written by someone who is outraged over the media bias, is incredibly unprofessional, full of hyperbole, personal rants, and very little decorum.  If Goldberg wants to convince us that the media has a liberal slant, he would be much better off keeping his own opinions to himself and write a centered book based on facts.  BIAS feels like a personal vendetta against Rather, against CBS, and I suspect that Goldberg had some aspirations for greatness in his return to CBS, was denied, and, in turn, wrote this scathing book as revenge 
 These headphones look great but I found them to be very uncomfortable, I tried them while excercising and was very difficult to get them to fit my ear they even made them a little sore from trying to get a better fit. Don't reccomend the 
 Sybex normally has a reputation of being THE book to study to prepare for your exam of choice.  Unfortunately this one falls well below of my expectations.  I've been in the IT industry for a few years now, and even I found this book to be a difficult read.  Many times, the elements presented dont follow a logical sequence, making it necessary to flip back and forth among chapters to gain the proper perspective.  This book often calls reference to items you'll learn in future chapters, which can be confusing when the authors throw acronyms at you that you dont understand.    Also, I find the review questions in this book rely solely on your memorization of the material studied, but not on APPLYING that knowledge to a real-life scenario, which is really what you will be tested on (applied knowledge).  The review CD that comes with the book is equally uneffective.  It does have a feature where you can re-review all the end-of-chapter questions, along with a "flash card" program of about 300 fill in the blank, and true/false questions, but again; these are strictly memorization, and doesnt really help when presented with a problem thats not in the book.    After finishing the 70-271 section, and answering all the book questions, I downloaded another test resource and was blown away with how much I still did not know.  I really cannot recommend this book, I really should start reading reviews before I blow 60 bucks.  Try the Microsoft Press books, they're more expensive, but well worth it.  At least you'll walk away with a feeling of actually being prepared for the test.  But of course, these are just my thoughts.  Good luck to all the techies in getting your certs 
 While I was tempted to give Out for a Kill 1 star, I gave it 2 stars for a couple of reasons. At least Seagal's character was something other than an ex-CIA/special forces guy...OK he was Chi Kung master, but at least he was something else! Another reason for the upgrade to 2 stars is the plot. Yes. There was nothing special with this plot, but at least it is one that can be followed. Unlike most of Seagal's most recent storyline, this one makes some sense. Again, it's certainly no Academy Award winner, but it's much better than some of Seagal's most recent efforts. Perhaps the biggest reason for giving this two stars is that 1 Star should be saved for his truly atrocious films such as The Patriot or Submerged. The fight scenes were decent but I'd love to see Seagal get back to more of the Aikido that he used in earlier films.  As was the case with the last Seagal film that I watched, the sound quality was awful. Rather than raising and lowering the volume to hear the dialogue, I simply turned on the subtitles. I'm more a fan (or simply a glutton for punishment) than my wife. She stopped watching after 15 minutes 
 The book claims you can build all projects with standard components. However, every project contains at least one component that can only be ordered on the website of the author! No details about those components is provided to force you to buy it in his shop and make it almost impossible to find it somewhere else. Also, the claim that all projects can be built for less than 100$ is an outright lie! Most projects are very expensive. I can be very brief about this book. Don't buy it! It's just an advertisement folder for his own company disguised as a book. Besides, every project in it can be found in one form or another on the internet for free 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 Rather than saving the company, little Billy Ford had to take it over to prove to his infamous family that he could handle it all by himself. Since then, the company has gone down the drain, the product plan is a mess, plants have had to be closed, and the company has had to shed tens of thousands of workers. He drove the company off a cliff and all but ruined everything.     Now, fortunately, he is gone - and the more important story is what comes next - if anything - out of the wreck 
 This book should be titled "Food Photography and other Commercial Assignments" or "The Sixty-dollar Disappointment" or even, "How to make Money off of things I already got paid for."  "Still-Life" is misleading as it indicates an artistic level this book does not attain to. If you're into Advertising photography, Penn is unique and often humorous but if you're looking for images to challenge you or reflect on, you will be disappointed, as was I. As for his personal work in this book, the question is, how many skulls and cigarettes do you want to look at? My personal opinion is, if you do something like that, do it, do it well, and move on.  In short, most are sharp, well-lit, and well-printed but shallow, like most Advertising 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 Nice compact box, and recording quality better than I expected.   One major flaw though, no preview when recording 640x480 resolution, just a black screen with 'REC' in the top corner.  Dropping back to 320x240 resolution doesn't help, this just displays the video preview in a tiny letter-box in the center of the display.  A real shame, I love the concept, but the lack of preview is a real problem.   Technical support claims that a future firmware upgrade will fix it, I'll keep my fingers crossed, but don't have high expectations 
 I personally really didn't enjoy this book. It was a waste of my time. Who really cares about his life. My teacher assigned the book and i was forced to read it. It was pain. I think he could of made it more interesting but unfortunately he had a very dull life. My teacher compared this book to Boy and in my mind there is no comparison. BOY was great book and Knots in my yo yo string was definatly not. I enjoyed reading boy but HATED reading knots in my Yo Yo string. IF you want to read a book i would definately recommend Boy and not Knots in my yo yo string. Thank you for your tim 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 The discusions of mercury, fluoride etc. are satisfactory, but this book pushes the preposterous Electro-dermal screening. A.k.a Electo-accupuncture According to Voll (EAV): Voll,  a German scientist who researched in the 50's, but the research has never been verified or validated. EAV is a  used by naturopaths and homeopaths without any scientific backing, that, as a homepathic dentist, I'm aware of. 
 The book was supposed to be "like new" and i came all bent up on all corners and there was a coffee stain inside one front cover and on the first couple of pages. This book has question and answer sections and you need a special paper to see the answers and this guy didnt even put it in there so basically the book is worthless to me. I am not happy at all and you wont be either 
 Yes he's great. He wins alot and is possibly one of the best Hold'em players of all time. I dont know if he did it on purpose but he basically tells you just enough that you understand he can do it but he doesnt offer any help on 'how' to do it. I think maybe he doesnt want to actually help anyone get better at poker. He just wants to advertise he's awesome. He says things like "then you have to figure out how to win the most money" after building up a whole story of a hand that you are going to win.  Sklansky and Harrington books tell you HOW to get the most money into the pot when you are going to win.  
 I am on my 2nd unit and both lockup after a short time. Neither the remote nor the front buttons will work when it locks up. You have to unplug it and leave it unplugged for at least 5 minutes - maybe longer.  It works good when it is working 
 Just read the Description behind the DVD or in amzon.com or yahoo.com! You'll be tantalized to watch this movie and after watching it, you'll regret of wasting your time! the story is great but the movie is terrible! I'm really sorry for Dean Cane cause after starring in the role of Super-man in great Louise & Clark TV series, accepts to play in such movies! 2 Stars is only for the good plot! and I hope, someday a good director with enough bugdet make a good movie on it 
 When I found this listing, I thought the "Extreme Power Stick Vacuum" meant the suction was powerful.  I apparently was wrong. This vacuum won't even pick up dust bunnies off the tile floor. Purchasing this item was a waste of my time and my money. 
 Billy Collins' work is shiftless, mundane and irresistably dull. His wit lacks humor and the reader, (assuming he/she is an avid poetry reader) should be unimpressed by the second poem of this book. The voice that the reader should hear while reading this monstrosity is the voice of a 6th-grader with a college-level vocabulary. There is no spark in Collins' writing. There is no life in this work. And if that is what it takes to become America's Poet Laureate, I will never read nor review another again! If, in fact, you are craving poetry with Outlaw flair and a touch of Hunter Thompson, I suggest you read "European Confession" by Timothy Edward Jones (ISBN: 1-4137-2867-7) 
 The purchase was handled very timely.  One book was ordered for a birthday gift and my recipient commented on how beautifully it was wrapped.  All my friends, and myself, were very happy. Thank you 
 As a professional photographer, I find myself going through 5-6 of these cords each year. My equipment is my livelyhood and although  it is used often, I am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it.  I use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera.  These cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them.  Eventually, the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground. (This has happened twice to me and fortunately I was able to catch the flash unit!)  The cord is indespensible if you need it, but contact Canon USA and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months 
 I found this book to be unreadable. If most people are like me and hear a little voice in their head as they are reading, the parentheses the author uses in practically every paragraph means a constant interruption of the flow of the idea and presentation. O'Hanlon seems to believe (or maybe assumes) that we are interested (and need to know) in what the heck (hell?) he is thinking (doing, looking, analyzing) every minute as he sails (vacations perhaps?)across the Atlantic. He should just tell me what he wants me to experience; there is no need to suggest alternative thoughts. 
 Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon "chloroform in print" and he wasn't kidding.  It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).  I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I don't know how anyone could believe this rubbish.  PLEASE, anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.  Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer, but it's worth a shot).    Joseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a "glass looker" - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish. He would use "magic stones" that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.  So convenient that he later found "gold plates" and used what he called the "Urim and Thum" (which, by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).    There are SO many myths that are told by members of the church "most men were SO distraught at the thought of polygamy", the age issue of Joseph translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's actual role in polygamy (which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband...  11 of Josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him, having NEVER divorced the first husband - what's up with that???).. etc.. and the list goes on and on...  I am not disputing that Mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts, I think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that's great! Just PLEASE do some homework first and don't just rely on the "power of prayer".  There is a reason that Utah is the [...] capital of the USA (I'm sure every one of those people "prayed" about that big business decision - it can OFTEN be mis-intrepreted).  
 You have to really be interested in the author's self importance to enjoy this book.  It grated on me on almost every page.  Despite its subject, I found it unflinchingly cold and also, extremely boring.  Maybe it was her point, but it's as though she's writing a academic text on grief and death ~ from quite a distance.  Frankly, I could not finish it as I decided life is too short to force myself to finish any book this difficult to get through.  The name dropping and "we were such a wonderful, powerful couple" gets so tedious I rolled my eyes more than a few times.  The medical detail and quotes from other sources on grief do not make it any more interesting, though I hoped it would.  I am surprised so many people liked this book.  I guess it boiled down to the fact that I did not find the author likeable and couldn't swallow the writing style; so had little interest in what she had to say 
 My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event! 
 The author must have greased his palms before he churned out this pot-boiler.  It was long-winded and predictable at every turn. Every major character was challenged merely to loom up out of the pages in two dimensions. 
 I've read tons of low carb books, and most are really useful. As much as I tend to enjoy the Dummies series in general, though, this book is a bit questionable.  I don't mind at all that Dr. Chauncey has written a diet book - I object that she titled it a "Low Carb" book. She repeatedly refers to this diet as a "Whole Foods Eating Plan" diet thoroughout the book - sometimes 8 times or more on a given page. She is very much pushing her own diet plan, which in many situations conflicts directly with a low carb plan.  In fact she makes many statements *against* low carb dieting, and even promotes some myths about low carb diets that have been disproven by studies. She promotes the drinking of fruit juices, even though most fruit juices have as much sugar (if not more) than soda and few nutrients.   There's little things too. She claims broccoli is America's favorite vegetable when clearly statistics show that is the potato. She says that shopping only once a week is great for dieting, when most people find that shopping for fresh food is best for finding great deals that are healthy. She says to avoid chicken wings, which is mind-boggling since most low carb dieters find this to be the ideal low carb food.  Dr. Chauncey says "don't count carbs in fruits" when fruits are often incredibly sugar-filled. Yes they're fine in small amounts, but gorging on fruit is hardly a pathway to health. She continually says to only "consider vitamin supplements" when there is no way that I know of to get all nutrients you need in a normal daily diet. She explicitly says "microwave ovens are great for vegetables" when studies have shown that microwaving vegetables destroy many of their nutrients.  There are of course some good things in the book. Many of the recipes are quite healthy. She is promoting her own diet which is a mix of low-fat, low-calorie, low-sugar and as a result, some recipes are natural food based and good. But she invents a new green / yellow / red system of coding foods which adds yet another level of complexity to an eating system. The items she puts into each category are not always logical.   She does talk about the importance of breakfasts, and the value of asking for healthy substitutions in restaurants. She talks about how, if you cheat, it's important to simply figure out why you did so and make plans to handle it in the future. She discusses how to arrange your fridge and shelves so that healthier foods are in front, so you're more likely to grab those first.   But again, those items would be mentioned in any healthy eating book. There certainly are other Dummies books on healthy eating. This book was supposedly positioned as a book on how to do a low carb diet, and it spent a fair amount of the book bashing or contradicting the low carb way. This would be like writing a Dummies books on dogs, and then spending a portion of the time talking about choosing cats instead. It just isn't why people would buy the book.  I really recommend that the Dummies crew redo this book with a real low carb writer, and rename the current book to 'Whole Foods Eating Plan for Dummies". That, after all, is what Dr. Chauncey refers to her plan as, over and over again 
 This book started off good, with the opening of the stadium and the first home run hit by Babe Ruth to christen the stadium. But after the first two chapters the book becomes to involved with the politics and the businessmen behind the stadium and its players. This book did not keep me entertained while I read it, and I found myself many times struggling to turn to the next page 
 This book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998!!!  Totally out of date! Useless!! Wondering why it is still for sale.  The author, contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked, simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one...  Outrageaous!  Spread the word and if you own the book, get your money back 
 I do not recommend this book..Other than the part where you learn to peel the onion of your problems..which you will read in any other Anxiety book..I do not recommended this book at all! Terrible..the breathing exercises to stop anxiety does not work!! Its so silly,waste of money!! I give it a D- Seriously..of course this is my opinion,but i have anxiety,so i would like to help other ppl save their money and time on another book! 
 This out of all the many versions of Jane Eyre has to be my least favorite...   Granted Samantha Morton has  a very  adorable fairy/ Elfin like face like Mr Rochesters Description of her, but her acting has  no highs and lows. She stands up to Mr Edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers, seemingly no respect to her employer, which is not fault of  hers, the writing of the script is bad.... and so the direction. Ciaran Hinds  is totally over the top. He is so angry with no understanding, his eyes are  very lustful and at times  crazed.  He is not at all like the character  described in Brontes epic book of a very sad and  tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the  innocence and singular personality of earnest, honest and yet strong sweet  Jane Eyre that Charlotte Bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words.    The over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical.To me there is no love, feeling  or chemistry here between the two actors just lust.... He seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl, and she though supposedy a virgin...  she dosn't act like one.  Plus this movie  seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story Especially during Janes childhood. I do also miss the Gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the Dalton /Clarke mini series, which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story.   If you want to see great versions. I  highly rate the 1944 movie with Orson Wells though it is another abreviatd version, that movie truly captured the spirit and feel. It is moody dark and mysterious. Another is the fantastic Timothy Dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the  Brontes story.  Dalton's and Clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime!   However if you are like me, see them all and make your own decision. They all have something to offer and most are entertaining... 
 I have been a Le Carre fan until the end of the Cold War. I somehow still managed to follow him later for some time. But now it is over, definitely. I disliked this novel, and the movie is obnoxious. Rachel Weisz is quite ridiculous in her part. Which idiot nominated her for her Oscar is beyond the point. Zellweger got an Oscar for an even more horrible performance recently, in the otherwise quite acceptable Cold Mountain. And even the otherwise great Blanchett had to turn in an awful performance in The Aviator to get one. (Why can these nice girls not get one for one of their good movies?) My conclusion: this world is strange. It has no idea what is good and what not. 
 I am absolutely stunned by the number of five-star reviews of this albums.  Is there really so little quality singing out there that people can be swayed by the likes of JoJo?  I mean, really, is there anything to JoJo, aside from her age, that you can't find in Kelly Clarkson, Joss Stone, or Christina Aguilera?  It's easy to imagine more interesting artists, like Clarkson or Stone, on I-love-myself declarations like "Coming for You."  An older artist could certainly make lines like "Come with me, stay the night/say the words, but boy/it don't feel right" and "I was young and in love..." less eye-rolling; this girl is 15, exactly how much romantic wisdom does she have?  In fact, it's difficult for me, a person who knows little about JoJo beyond this album, to tell how talented the young singer actually is, since the vocals - particularly on "Too Little Too Late" - are covered with more layers of production than your average Britney Spears single.  This is normal in the music industry today, of course; it doesn't necessarily mean JoJo is a poor singer, and it doesn't make her songs any less addictive, but it's hard for an adult or savvy teen to ignore the amount of electronic tweaking present on this album.    Maybe JoJo should try doing an MTV Unplugged concert (do those still exist?) to see if she's worth all the hype; I suspect she isn't 
 I dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap-opera like compulsion, always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our Lord.  Therefore, I anticipated this final novel to be glorious, as the title indicates, but I was woefully wrong.  Are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming King and His Kingdom?  Certainly not!    I support Christian fiction with many 5 star reviews,--just look at my other reviews--but I can not recommend this series 
 I bought this book rather in spite of than because of the other Amazon reviews, and lugged it with me on a flight out to the West Coast.  The book lasted from Boston to Atlanta, and when it was over I closed it with a sigh of relief.  While Shermer is certainly at times an engaging writer here he indulges in a rather peculiar form of quantitative psycho-history mixed in with the equally peculiar allocation of behavioural traits to birth order. There MAY be something in this somewhere, but at the same time it smacks of the 19th century Victorian fetish about cranial measurments that Shermer's evident hero-mentor Stephen Gould took to task in THE MISMEASURE OF MAN.  That Shermer is so obsessed with his methodologies (he devotes a substantial portion of the book to 'how he did it") is a shame because it lessens and weakens his focus on his putative topic, the fascinating Alfred Wallace. Instead of really delving intoWallace's background and early experiences we get a few pages of quick gloss intertwined with what frankly struck me as mumbo-jumbo about what it means to be a Younger Child. This may be all very new Age & Hip right now, but I strongly doubt it will prove to have much in the way of scholarly legs. Then there is the tedious re-hashing of Gould's speculations which other reviewers have already re-hashed.  Yup, they are old, they are trite, and can we please now move on?  Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is the discussion of Wallace's involvement with various "Spiritualist" frauds during the second half of his career. Here the writing really picks up & one has the sense that "aha, now we are going to get somewhere". Alas, the excitement soon fades & the book itself fades out to a gentle glow at the end.  i really don't know how to categorize this text.  It is far too incomplete for someone unfamiliar with Wallace's life & work to get a real sense of the man and it offers such an odd view on Wallace's relationships with friends, family, colleagues & rivals that one is left wondering just what was intended.  A footnote to a more general study? Maybe, but i agree with the reviewer who calls for the need of a REAL biography that puts Wallace AND his science in proper context 
 I have over 20 commentaries on First John.  I consider this among the bottom five.  Analysis is superficial and not particularly insightful.  It might be an acceptable book for an introduction to First John, but if that's what you want, there are better books.  If you are looking for solid introductory books, try Marshall or Smalley.  If you are looking for deep textual analysis try Brown or Brooke.  I don't agree with the positions taken by all of these authors, but their works are far more insightful then the Pillar book.  I recently went back to college to audit a course where the Kruse book was a required text.  Part way through the course, the professor apologized for using the book and said that in the future he will use a different book for First John 
 I tossed this s*** out my window this afternoon on I-95. I am sick to death with these weak a** Pac compilations. S*** like this is proof PAC is dead. Most of these rappers Pac would have never on his worse day would have steped into the studio with them. This is ridculous. Go ahead call me a hater, I dont give a f***. I listen to rap and love rap because I was raised on the s***, not because its the cool thing to do. Thats for you goofs who think B*tch unit, jeezy and joc is the bomb. Honestly, I think these crazy muthaf***** is bein paid to kick dirt on pac's name. Dont support this. Save your money and cop Nas and Ghost's new albums. 
 I ordered the magazine and immediately received my first issue, but unfortunately over the course of the year I only received a total of THREE issues! The magazine is great, but I wonder what the problem is. I have no received much help from amazon or Modern Bride. Guess I learned my lesson not to subscribe online anymore. 
 I am conservative on most issues but I do have some problems with our strategies in the Iraq war.  I have a very liberal friend who is in love with the term "Neocon".  He is constantly critizing me for reading "right wing" propaganda so I said I would give his idea of a great book a try.  I read a little over half of the book and I couldn't take it anymore.  I found myself dreading getting back to the book each day, to me this is just a liberal antiwar hit piece.  There are some good questions in the book on our strategies and troop deployment.  But the author's hate of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Rice take over and cloud every chapter.  He makes the Neocons sound like Dr. Evil's Chamber in the Austin Powers movies.  His referencing was always from the far left blogs and publications, he constantly referenced conversations that could never be substantiated.  My friend told me this was a historical book, apolitical, I think not.  Read it if you want to, I couldn't get through it.  Ann Coulter is an idealogue, but at least she is funny 
 I've been a huge fan of Vam Damme since I saw him in No Retreat, No Surrender then even more after I had seen Lionheart. The problem is after Universal Soldier: The Return his movies have lost alot of the intensity, and dare I say it integrity that the previous ones had and that I've always enjoyed. I mean I give him credit for The Order, Derailed, and Desert Heat, those were pretty good but nothing like what he used to make. I do realize that he is trying new things, maybe even trying to get away from just doing Martial Arts flicks but if I were him I'd stick to what I'd know would do well.  To tell you the truth this one was so bad I couldn't even bear to finish watching it.   What happened to you big guy 
 I am not a follower of the Oak Island mystery, just someone who read an interesting article in Rolling Stone about the mystery and then went in search of more detail.  This book is badly written, confusing and overly presumptive.  Do not buy 
 Not enough information about the popular culture or nightlife to really absorb the lifestyle of Cariocas. For such a complex and exciting city, this book offers basic, conventional information, some of which is out dated and few photos or illustrations. ...This book gives me the yawns. I recommend Rio for Partiers (even if you are not twenty-something)to get excited about traveling to Rio de Janeiro, one of the most gifted cities in the world 
 This author is notorious for errors, serious omissions, & questionable "sources" in his work. If you are a student, DO NOT CITE THIS MAN'S BOOKS AS SOURCE MATERIAL IN A PAPER OR THESIS 
 outdated and lacking in any novel good advice or ideas. A lot of the advice is simple common sense. I guess I was looking for information more about the psychology of childrens friendships. Still, this title is simplistic and I found it to be less than helpful 
 This is one of the many books, such as "Little Black Sambo" that many (white) adults have fond memories of, and most black people find deeply offensive. While many might feel that the characters could "be of any race" and that "it teaches children important lessons" and the the story is "beautiful and touching," I feel that it does perpetuate racism and stereotypes -- both overtly and in more subtle ways.  "Dar wuz dis sum pepuz who wuz settin, an dey wuz axin bawt dis mawnin, low dat dey waz tard. Dey kep runnin way fer ter fer home, sot dar wunner nudder, an de wuz gwine fas. Twel bimeby wuz atter fer ter ketch, bless grashus, hit wuz down ter dis day, an duh bimeby dey, gwineter git fer ter tell, deze yer, dish yer, an fer ter git, dey wuz dere an gun ter."  What important lesson does this teach young children? How could this apply to upper-middle income children in Marin, Westchester, or Cook Counties 
 Advice on the level of "avoid grizzly bears" and "tigers are dangerous predators"-(actual quotes more or less).  If this is the level of advice you need, this book is for you.  Also recommends catching  and eating tuna and marlin when in a jam. Thanks for the info 
 Not in a long time have i had such a dislike for a movie as i do with Freeway. I am a fan of dark comedies so i thought i might check this movie out, it has reese witherspoon after all, how bad could it be? Well, really bad. First of all on a good note, reese witherspoon is good enough in the movie, although her character isn't all that likeable nor do you empathize with her all that much. But Reese does a good job with what shes given.  My main beef with the movie is that i would not call it a dark comedy. It's more like a comedy that also wants to be dark, graphic and serious, or a dark graphic serious movie that wants to be funny. The result is that it's a movie that doesnt know what it is or what it's trying to do. Both the funny parts and the serious parts are horribly mixed together in a way that it feels like two different movies fighting for the screen.  But hey, if you find being shot in the neck, or stiff lifeless grandmas with their throats slit and a horrified expression on their face to be funny, you just might like this movie 
 Jeez, aside from about 30 pages of goodness about Steve Mcqueen and a few old-time H/A stories-which are told using lame-o aliases and seem to be recalled through a certain haze...this is just a steamin' pile of crap. Crap I could hear if I went to the gaywad leather bar in my town. What can I say, I have all the respect in the world for Barger, the H/A's, whatever, but I didn't pay money to read about a yuppie's BMW road trip. Seriously.  I just expected better from somebody who has better stories than this (really, he's gotta have better stories...Son-come on, you don't have better than this??). I just kept thinking that Barger just really didn't want to be doing this, and it came down to these two nutsucker ghost-writers grasping at straws 
 As I had consumed all my leCarrï¿½, I sought something to fill the space of a long plane flight. This was suggested to me. If you are a JlC fan, be forewarned, this book's low-calorie diet will be very disappointing. Short on detail, a lot of repetitive word usage, even trite phraseology....it's all here. I have been told that this is not AF's best stuff, and I have no doubt that might be true. This feels formulaic, hurried. Remember the movie Foreign Correspondent? This book, of course, is not that story, but it illustrates an unusual point for me. Ordinarily, print has so much advantage over film in its ability to evoke imagination and supply rich textures. After all the praise of AF for his ability to evoke the moody 1930s, I was certainly jazzed to get some of that. But not this book. I was consistently aware I was reading a novel, unengrossed, unpersuaded, no disbelief suspended. The movie TFC, in contrast, is extremely effective in transporting you to pre-war times. It could well be--indeed, I have zero trouble imagining--that a movie of AF's book would actually be more interesting than the book itself, that in the hands of a great dirrector, it could be quite compelling. That's how unsatisfying the book is 
 This movie, which I viewed 25 years ago, does not age well. While the tension between the generals is effectively portrayed, there are too many hokey elements to the actual sets. Perhaps I am wrong and some European reader could correct me, but I find it hard, in the middle of the war, with prior bombing raids, to believe that the streets of the Holland town were immaculately clean. There is too much waiting around in this movie and not enough actual portrayal of action. Too many of the officers trapped in the town escape for me to regard the movie as realistic. And would a British general have gone that far forward--I know the real Sean Connery would have but a real British general???????? 
 I can understand all the praises poured down on this recording.  The recording is almost magical and the orchestral playing leaves nothing to be desired.  It is just like the Sports Illustrated Annual Swimsuit Issue.  The girls are so pretty, sensuous, and beautifully photographed.  And Yes, both are utterly devoid of spiritual communication while still remaining attractive.  The Immense Hollow is probably the only thing Karajan delivers, as he does most of the time.  There are many great recordings of Mahler Ninth, Klemperer, Boulez, young Bernstein, and even Abbado with Mahler Youth Orchestra, for example, which will surely amaze you at the very personal level.  This recording is a true Hollywood version of Mahler Ninth, although some people mistakenly label Bernstein with that name.  If you need to buy Karajan's record, I would recommend his Vienna New Year's Concert.  That was the only time I found Karajan really satisfying 
 This navigational system is useless. I have never gotten so lost before in my life. It tells you to take next left, when indeed it is in about 3 lefts, vise versa with rights.  Gave to my daughter and she constantly called me lost and upset so I tried it myself.  It literally took me about 9 miles out of my way to get to a local establishment.  Tried changing the preferences and it was worse.  Checked the manual, tried everything, if you put it on preferences for no toll roads/highways it takes you in circles down back roads till your dizzy.  If you program it on tolls/highways it will take you miles out of your way to locate a toll road and then back again.  If you program to the middle of the preference line it does not know where the heck you are and keeps searching.  Stay away! This one is a waste of money 
 I have to say this was not a very good movie.  Daryl Hannah is a hit woman gone soft. She can't do her job anymore because she's pregnant. It's not believable in the slightest. She has her target two feet in front of her in several scenes and she turns away because the target is also pregnant. There are some flashback scenes that delve into the Daryl character's past...abuse and such leading to her being a hit woman, I guess.  Save your time and money. Daryl Hannah was marginal in terms of her acting, but the real annoyance in this movie was Dominique Swain. Her acting was horrible beyond description. Save your money and see or buy something else 
 I would like to comment on the content of this book, but I have read only 25 pages and I have fallen asleep four times.  This book is very poorly written.  It is confusing and poorly organized.  It starts in the middle of the story and then meanders around endlessly.  I sure would like my money back 
 Lets start by saying that this item is over-priced.  Miss Weather is very limited.  How much better if there were: at least three pages, many outfits, backgrounds, and objects. Miss Weather Dress-Up leaves little to the imagination. This is an item that offers little.       
 The main thing to remember about this book is that it is a journal.  So if you are looking for a beginning, middle and end you won't find it here.  I kind of felt like "what is the point?" after I read it.  It was also hard for me to understand how Anais Nin could write all these words of love about Henry Miller.  I tried to read Miller's TROPIC OF CAPRICORN but I had to stop because he is such a misogynistic jerk. I couldn't believe the feelings of hate he had towards his poor first wife, and the way that he saw all women as trash.  I had a hard time not thinking that Anais Nin was crazy to risk her marriage to a wonderful man for a horrible man like Miller.  This is not a great book, but the one good thing about it is that it is very sensual and erotic 
 THE BASE is an overall average film. Clearly the actors' talents are not put to full use. Mark Dacascos' excellent martial arts skills are supressed to appear like a good street fighter, not the impressive military weapon he is suppose to portray. The story line is interesting, but is weakened by the poor ending of this action film. The good guy wins, but it is a dismal victory. The nudity added to The Base does not really flow with the story line. The director clearly failed in this film. The acting in this film is very good, but the camera angles were not. I'm sure the actors were disappointed with the final product. THE BASE is worth seeing once. I suggest renting versus buying 
 Batman Begins is soooo much better than this or any other of the batman movies. Nicholson SUCKED as the Joker. Joker is a comedian who had an accident trying to pull a robbery to help his pregnant wife. HE IS NOT A GANGSTER OR THE ONE WHO KILLED BATMAN'S PARENTS!!!! HE IS A PSYCHO AND BATMAN'S NEMESIS!!! YOU CAN'T KILL HIM OFF!!! HOW STUPID IS THAT?!!! Who came up with that one. Keaton is a sissy, Christian Bale could beat him down!!! Keaton DID NOT have the physical prescence to play Batman. All in all, a joke of a comic movie..But it is better than Daredevil!!!!:- 
 I know he's a famous "name-it-and-claim-it" preacher, so I wanted to see his thoughts exactly, rather than sit through some rambling sermons of his and get pieces here and there.  That's the great thing about books- preachers have to be concise and to the point.    I discovered he is teaching something I never heard before.  First, let me say that he acknowledges some truthful teachings.  He acknowledges that we are not to be greedy.  He acknowledges that Jesus said to store our treasure in heaven, not earth.  He acknowledges that there is nothing evil about money, but the "love of money" is what is evil (although, I think prosperity teachers like himself are deceived; they are in love with money, which is evident by seeing their lifestyles).  And, by the way, there is much in his book that is very good.  I only want to point out some of the dangerous errors.  And here it is:    He says that we are not to store treasure on earth, but in heaven.  That is true.  The Scripture says it.  But look at what he says that means.  He says that the storehouse for our treasure is in heaven, not the earth (not in banks).  When you need money, you can get it when you want, from God, from our heavenly storehouse.  There's no need to store it here (on earth), where robbers and thieves can get to it.      According to Copeland, how do you make deposits and withdrawals from this treasure bank in heaven?     From pages 63-75, he says how to make deposits.  These include (his words for the subheadings in this section):  -- Tithing (I this this is, by far, the most important) -- Giving to the Poor -- Investing in the Gospel -- Giving as a Praise to God    From pages 75-86 he explains how to make a withdrawal.  In the summary for making a withdrawal, he lists 6 points, culminating in a prayer that summarizes these points.  Here's his prayer from page 85-86:  "Father, in the Name of Jesus, we ask you for $____.  We have this money in our heavenly account and we are withdrawing this amount now.  We believe we receive $____.  As in Mark 11:23-24, we believe it in our hearts and confess now that it is ours in the Name of Jesus.  We agree that we have $____ according to Matthew 18:19.  From this day forward, we roll the care of this over on You and thank You for it.  Satan, in the name of Jesus, we take authority over you; we bind your operation now and render you helpless.  Ministering spirits, we charge you to go forth and cause this amount to come to us according to Hebrews 1;14.  Father, we praise Your Name for meeting our needs according to Your riches in glory by Christ Jesus and for multiplying our seed for sowing in the Name of Jesus."     I have just two questions for Pastor Kenneth Copeland:  1. Do you really live by these principles? Do you have a significant savings account and/or retirement bank account? According to your book, you shouldn't, if you really believed what you wrote.  2. Why didn't the first disciples and Apostles living in Jerusalem know this "secret" about heavenly "deposits" and "withdrawals?"  They were so poor and in hardship that the Apostle Paul went around making a special collection for them from the other Roman churches, as mentioned in 2 Cor. 8 and other passages.  In fact, why didn't any other theologians ever teach this heavenly deposit and withdrawal system?  Shouldn't that be a hint to you that you are going off into the deep end???!!!   
 The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time 
 The book offers very general points already covered by the hundreds of sales books written before.  Did not like the constant reference to the author's website for additional details/information.  I was looking for a little sales motivation, not being "sold" to.. 
 Doyles section is basically the same and is why it got 2 stars in the first place. I feel the poker pros were not used properly for this book. Daniel negranu is a coward for  doing three card draw that has no merit on real card tables and he should of just declined it in the first place,he is a no limit and omaha 8 or better expert and should of wrote on that instead. Bobby baldwin was the most sound poker player during his time, kind of like alan cunningham of today. So I dont know why he didnt write the limit chapter again,  I think modern day limit players would have really been in for a treat. I have nothing against jeniffer harmen writing it but I think it was better served for baldwin. Please save your money and dont buy this book. If need be they should have it at your local library 
 The Doldrums has a very muffled sound. As if a pillow was pressed against the stereo out on wich the original recording was being played, and the whole thing was rerecorded using a cassete deck. Or something like that. Anyway, it puts me off tremendously. Cause underneath that pillow there are some very beautiful songs. Ariel Pink has an ear for great melodies and his singing style (wich frequently switches to falsetto)works well. Most songs don't follow the classic song structure, but rather circle around a central melodie. The best moments on The Doldrums are however those songs wich sound like four radio stations being switched back and forth. Too bad the radio is underneath a pillow 
 I'm reviewing this novel late; I read it a while back.  But I am surprised at the majority of positive reader reviews.  Like reading the prologue in Cunningham's The Hours, reading this novel's equisitely written first few pages was like having the icing before the cake and finding the cake itself bland and flat (and, well, so depressing, too, without being interesting, and dark without really terrifying, and the style itself throughout, irritatingly problematic).   But there is a brilliance and depth of image in those first pages, and I hope that one day in another novel--or novella?-- this author--I think he's fairly young--will give whatever time it takes to sustain (for the most part) that same genius through to the end.  I also loved the title 
 Tina is molested by her stepfather, who she thinks is her real father, until her mother finally tells her that he isn't. Tina is vague about the details of the abuse and doesn't actually say what happened, so the reader is left in the dark as to how far it went. She prays to God many times to make it stop (why'd he let it start in the first place?), but God is not listening at those times. Finally after many years of this abuse, her mother catches them together, and instead of kicking him out, sends her daughter to a school out of town, with the stepfather driving her an hour each way every day. The Lutheran minister they go to tells mother to keep the family together, and they don't need to involve the authorities because her stepfather says he's sorry (sorry that he got caught). Says it's just something about Tina that makes him do it.  Make sense? The mother works at Kmart and likes to have kids she doesn't care about, and the dad works "in an office".   The rest of her growing up is fairly normal. She has a boyfriend and he kisses someone else. Ouch. She goes off the college, and finds out her high school boyfriend is seeing her best friend. Tina doesn't seem too upset by this, she's busy with college and new friends anyway. Then he comes to visit her, tells her he got the other girl pregnant, but he really loves her. She quickly moves in with him. The other girl's pregnancy or resulting child is so unimportant that it is NEVER mentioned again. In due time, Tina gets pregnant by him and has an abortion. She says she regrets it. Gets pregnant by him again, has another abortion. Regrets this one too. However, she never talks about what her life would be like if she DID have these two kids by this loser. Nope, it just was wrong and she wishes she'd never done it, but never takes responsibility that is was her decision based on the circumstances she was in at the time. Having an abortion is just SO wrong, that you don't have to think about the consequences of actually having the baby. She seems to put the "blame" for her two abortions on society.  Talks her unmarried sister into keeping her unplanned pregnancy.   Breaks up with the impregnating loser, meets a "normal" guy. He wants to marry her, they plan big wedding with white dress and bridesmaids. She thinks she doesn't really love him, calls mother to discuss (why bother?). Mom tells her she better get married to this great guy. Tina decides she ought to do it in a few days before she changes her mind. Buys BLACK dress to get married in. Has small wedding. Has finished college, and EVERY job she wants, she GETS. Whines about working and traveling, so tired. Persuades husband to go back to college and get degree in engineering.   Husband is so smart that he figures finances and tells her they can afford a house. Has baby girl, his parents buy a crib she doesn't like (of all the nerve!). His mother tries to take over (helping too much)and Tina gets frustrated but won't tell her off. How much can a person be expected to take? Husband tells her she doesn't have to work anymore. They buy bigger newer house. Tina whines about packing and moving, so much work.   Gets pregnant with second baby (never notices when she's pregnant, always thinks she has a stomach virus). Getting depressed and tired with being pregnant and cleaning house, starts sitting in hot tub every night. Guess doctor didn't tell her this is bad for baby as it raises baby's temperature too much (already hot inside mother's body). Slips and falls on icy deck (not good idea to be walking on while pregnant), hurts back, whines some more.  Has second baby, too depressed and physically in pain to take care of self or both children. Medication not helping. Asks mom for help, she refuses, has to "watch stocks on TV for boyfriend" (has left husband finally). Guess husband's family doesn't want to help now? Church people help some, not enough for her. Husband begs her mom to help. She does. Twice. Apparently husband cannot figure out that he should put both kids in daycare while he works, pick them up after work, then  take care of them himself when they go home (just like a single mom does!) Never enters his head.   While Tina is at mom's house (not too depressed to  drive or go to mom's house), mom tells her to "snap out of it". This makes Tina snap for real, she jumps in car, drives to bridge, tries to jump off.  Cop grabs her (pictures are terrible, can't see what happened. Picture of car on bridge, wow).     Finally starts going to therapist, but her "faith" (now) helps more. Discovers "uplifting" Christian CD's. Faces fact that she and mom will never have mother/daughter relationship the way she wants it. Says mom saw her as rival for husband instead of daughter she should have protected. That's true.  This book is short (I read it at the bookstore), and its main focus is if you get Christ in your life, your depression will be lifted. But that makes no sense as she was praying and going to church all her life. Tina was searching, yes, but expecting to find the answer to her problems with God. This did not help before, and she seems to have tried to adjust things in her mind to make it that way after the bridge incident. The whole time she needed to look INSIDE herself. Yes, the abuse never should have happened, her mother was a terrible person, and all this affected her self-esteem. But she won't deal with it, won't get angry at mom or stepdad. Apparently she never sees any self-help books or anything like that, and relies solely on church and her "beliefs" to get her emotions in check (and this appears to be a very ineffective solution). By the way, Tina mentions that she cannot get physically helped by Reiki because it conflicts too much with the beliefs she's had all her life. The beliefs she's had ever since she was a child molested by her stepfather. Tina's not much of a one for upgrading her beliefs, which leads her to feeling stuck in certain situations.   Tina had a lot of things to be grateful for: nice husband and provider, didn't have to work, nice house, healthy kids, nice in-laws, college education, but she is not appreciative. Tina's almost constant whining about things that would seem very small to anyone else, negated any effect this book could have had on me as portraying a mother depressed enough to jump off a bridge. She just seemed spoiled to me.   For such a deep subject, this book lacked substance and seemed to tiptoe  around the issues. There is no calling a spade a spade - the whole thing is superficially written. Anyone who's had to deal with real problems, especially while depressed, will not "get" this book 
 Sorry, I am confused why and African-American woman would be so docile and unable to defend herself. How could she not get a drop on the the main character's assistant -- Oh Come On. Anyway, sorry this book did not do much for me 
 I don't remember when last I read any prose that comprises of mainly adjectives! I was constantly groping for my red pen to edit out the superfluous ones. Of course, descriptions are necessary but the overabundance here completely defeats the purpose. I can't describe what I mean better than to quote Jane Austen: "Every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind." So also Durrell. The excess of words and descriptive expressions, intended no doubt to paint vivid images in our minds, hamper the reader instead of creating a stage for the drama about to unfold. We are lost among the brushes, pigments and paint tubes, never getting far away enough to see the whole painting. I usually 'disappear' into literature but when reading this man's words I can't for a moment forget that I'm reading 
 These guys haven't put a good album out since Floored.  Lemonade and Brownies is a great metal album and by far their best.  Once "Fly" was a hit, it ruined their sound and they completely sold their souls and sold out their old fans.  When I heard the first single off this album, I almost cried to see how low this band has gone.  I can't believe Mark McGrath was in that Angel's Song for Sevendust.  Now there's a metal band that still puts out good hard albums 
 Just when it seemed dispensationalism was losing steam, along came Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins to breathe new life into the movement with the apocalyptic novel Left Behind. That book and the remainder of the series is based upon the dispensationalist system of eschatology developed in the 19th century and made the standard for fundamentalism in the 20th. That there is little scriptural or historical support does not seem to phase its adherents in the least. They merely read their own meanings into passages by imposing a systematic superstructure upon the prophetic verses of Scripture and map their imagined meanings onto the texts. This artificial system is made to fit - often in a forced manner - no matter how square the pegs and how round the holes.  Yet before LaHaye came up with the idea for Left Behind, he also wrote books detailing the system he supported in a more conventional manner. One of the more important to gain an understanding of LaHaye's eschatological views is his commentary on the Book of Revelation, Revelation Unveiled. Here we see the system that guides his novels without the ability to hide behind claims of literary license. What emerges is a parochial, nationalistic, and bigoted vision in which God seems to save the most vital outpourings of the Holy Spirit for White Anglo-Saxon Protestants living in the southern United States.   Needless to say, LaHaye would take issue with that claim but this is primarily because he fails to recognize the flaws and biases of the ingrained assumptions that are intrinsic to the fundamentalist subculture that has formed the backdrop of his theological upbringing. Part of this is a virulent anti-Catholicism that manifests itself in opposition to much of what is historic Christianity in favor of an individualistic and uniquely Ameican distortion of the faith. He time and again peddles views that are part of the American ethos as essential to Christianity and holds what happens to his subculture and their ancestors as determining the health of the Church.  This parochialism is seen early in his interpretation of the seven churches as outlining periods of Church history with the most negative saved for the medieval and contemporary church and the most positive saved for his idealized period of Evangelicalism. Besides the obvious fact that there is no justification in the text or history for such an interpretation, there is the clear problem that he sees everything from the eyes of a modernist American. The so-called "Dark Ages" were a completely Western phenomenon and even then it recovered when peace was restored. In the Eastern half of the Roman Empire, the Byzantines carried on the great patristic tradition and in the lands east of the old empire, the Church of the East would engage in one of the most remarkable evangelistic outreaches in history. In the ideal Evangelical age of LaHaye's imagination, Christianity was in almost complete decline as the views of secularism took hold of Europe and much of America. In the contemporary era when things are supposed to be collapsing, Asia and Africa are seeing conversions to the faith that dwarf any evangelistic outreach in history. It is quite obvious LaHaye judges the success of the Church by the success of that part of the Church through which he can trace his lineage.   Things do not get much better in later chapters as LaHaye uses all manner of logical gymnastics to attempt to make the Scriptural passages fit into the dispensationalist system. All he seems to do is perform verbal sleight-of-hand and, when he cannot overcome the obvious difficulties, resort to ad hominem attacks on his opponents. Again and again he constructs artificial and completely shallow arguments for the rapture but never explains why there is no passage in Scripture that states Christ will come back twice. It is merely the system that imposes the idea and the necessity of the system that divides passages into "rapture" and "second coming" classes. Amid the charts and graphs is the undeniable fact that this system is a modern construction that would not have been recognized by any Christian living in the first millennia and a half of the Church's existence.  Not that this is an issue for most dispensationalists. There is a great irony that these alleged rebels against modernism are thoroughly modernistic in their approach to Holy Scripture. History means nothing to them as they revel in their "new discoveries" that could not have been known "until now." Just as all the Christians throughout history must step aside to their superior understanding, even the world itself must end because they have arrived to usher in the last days. They have taken the modernist idea of progress and internalized it as a facet of the Christian faith. The belief that modern Evangelicals will unite with Jews to usher in the end of all things (of course, the Evangelicals get whisked away while the Jews are left behind to face slaughter) becomes an apocalyptic version of the American ideal of manifest destiny. Nineteenth century modernism lies at the heart of twenty-first century fundamentalism.  The crudeness of LaHaye's anti-Catholicism is not as subtly displayed as in his fictional Left Behind series. Here he makes overt attacks and draws heavily upon Lorraine Boettner's Roman Catholicism as a source for his views. Boettner's work has long been recognized as horribly biased and inaccurate and has been a sourcebook for anti-Catholic bigots for decades.   His crude biases apply no less to those with non-dispensationalist views than to those from other ecclesial traditions. He constantly harps on the fact that dispensationalists take a "literal" reading but this is clearly not the case. In a book laden with symbolism, the symbolic interpretation is the literal reading. In fact, LaHaye gets it all backwards! In his interpreation of the first three chapters that are not part of John's vison and are clearly messages to seven churches in first century Asia Minor, he reads them as symbolic of Church history. But in the later chapters that are part of John's apocalyptic vision and obviously drenched in symbolism, he complains because others seek to understand the symbols in their proper context. Here, LaHaye and other dispensationalists go wild trying in bizzarre attempts to match these symbols to "literal" modern weaponry. It never occurs to them that such prophetic visions in the Holy Scriptures are never analagous to a video playback but are given in symbols that need interpreting.  A glance at the bibliography given in the book is evidence enough of his insulation within the fundamentalist mindset. The books cited are largely from his own fundamentalist camp and reinforce his own biases. He makes no attempt to understand those with different views in their own words but merely parrots attacks from other authors who share the views of his subculture. Even the few that do not fall into this category are outdated works that do not reflect contemporary standards of scholarship.   Revelation Unveiled is a textbook case that exposes the truly unsavory backdrop that underlies the worldview of fundamentalism. It takes much of the worldview of 19th century Anglo-Americanism and seeks to apply it as a foundation for the Christian faith. Dispensationalism is thus merely an outgrowth of that view applied to escahtology. If there were any doubt, LaHaye unwittingly asserts just how culturally biased that view has become. Even among dispensationalist commentaries on the Book of Revelation, it attempts new lows. It is the "ugly American" of eschatological commentaries and should give pause to any reader of the Left Behind series who does not share its underlying biases. 
 I have read numerous books on Forex trading and this ranks amongst the worst. This is a sham and is designed in duping wannabees into partubg with their hard earned cash. The tools mentioned in this book are available free on many websites and the strategies are too simplistic (in a bad way) Good luck with implementing them but by the time you do, the event will have been and gone 
 Purchsed this item as a gift for Christmas. The DVd was bad, and would not play. Amazon sent another right away, so customer service was excellent. However, the second one did not play either. This time, Amazon failed to follow up after we notified them of the failure of the second DVD. We still have a DVd that does not work. And after requesting a label to send it back, we have not heard from Amazon since. First time we ever had a bad product, and also the first time amazon has failed to assist us in getting a replacment or refund. 
 Can't say enough about this album. I got it as traditional CD several months ago, and it is, by far, the best music I've bought all year. Due the sparse selection of DVD-A, I was thrilled to see it offered here in this format. The positive reviews on the mix were even more encouraging. I've got a dedicated DVD-Audio player run through a Pioneer 135 watts per channel amp running Klipsh KG 5.5 mains and comperable center, surrounds and sub. -Not a totally high-end system, but it'll hold its own.  I have to say that I was disapointed when I heard the album for one reason: Knopfler's voice is 95% relegated to the center channel. Perhaps it's a matter of taste, but there is way too much separation between voice and instuments. The idea of 5 channel separation is a wonderful thing when done right -any Donald Fagen, Hotel California, but there's a fine line in the mixing between perfection and annoying. In my opinion, this one crosses that line. Some may love it; to me, it's unbalanced and makes for a frustrating listening experience.  -Bria 
 The compositions, Rhythms and singin-style of Peter Cetera sound always the same. He is a typical sappy love song - singer who prefers the love ballads and cheesy love adventures. it might have been a bit tedious and boring.  The problem is everywhere: If you are a Hardrock fan like bands Uriah Heep, Stevie Ray Vaughan, AC/DC, Rory Gallagher, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, your ears can't be familar with all these silly love songs. My ears cannot work like that.  there are two alternatives: - if you are a hardrock fan. You like a mythological lyrics, you won't like Peter Cetera or Chicago. Keep your fingers away from this !!! - if you are a sappy love song fan then please buy this cd !! 
 This book has a great title, but that's about it. My 10 year old daughter thought the stories were boring.  We were very surprised by the amount of violence in these stories, and cannot recommend the book for that reason 
 well, it's my first return to Amazon, followed by my second. This kettle blows steam out the edges of that big opening right onto the handle. Picking it up is risky business. It leaks water. I used to have a Revere kettle I loved, this one is nothing like it. 
 The book A Gathering of Days is a journal of a young England girl growing up facing some trials and tribulations.  The whole book consists of Catherine's journal entries about her happy, sad, and eventful life as a young child growing up in England in the 1800's.  The journal was given to her by her grandmother, which later Catherine passed down to her granddaughter.  Catherine experiences many difficult times as a child.  At the beginning of the book, Catherine's mother dies leaving her with her father and siblings.  Later in the story her dad remarries and Catherine has to get used to living with a new brother and step mom.  Her step mom teaches her many new things though that she never would have known, like quilting.   	The whole narrative is told from Catherine's point of view.  She describes through her journal her feelings and emotions that she is going through as a child growing up.  The story is realistic in such a way that young girls or even children can connect with Catherine as they may be facing the same situations that she does.  By reading her journal, children can also see what is was like to grow up in England and compare it to their lives.  The author does an acceptable job of describing the characters so the reader is able to visualize them in their head.  The story though is a bit confusing because it is written like it was back in the 1800's.     	The overall story was okay.  It was realistic in such a way because the reader could see what it was like growing up in England in the 1800's.  The reader could also connect with the main character as she describes her feelings and emotions. 
 Basically, this book was a huge disappointment.  If you're wondering about purchasing a copy of this book, here's my advise.  Find a library with the title and take a look at it before you buy.  Or, just go to the B&H Photo's internet web site and read the information they have graciously provided on artificial photographic lighting.  I learned more from these guys than I did from this book.    What I noticed immediately upon opening the book is that the photos taken of people by the author are absolutely terrible.  Almost all of them have this ugly magenta hue that is very distracting.  The magenta hue is in the skin tones only.  Maybe that's just due to a bad choice of film since his still-life photos (e.g. a basket of fruit) look just fine.  Furthermore, there is a noticeable amount of glare present on the faces of all his models.  It looks like this glare is due to either over-exposed film, poor make-up, or (heaven forbid in a book on lighting for photography) really bad lighting!  The poor quality of these images really makes you wonder if the author is qualified to write such a book.  I didn't find the book very informative either.  One would think that a book on studio lighting would have all sorts of great in-depth information on the topic - stuff you can't find anywhere else.  It didn't.  For example, standard diagrams showing how to arrange lights, and some sample images showing the effect of the lighting arrangement, would have been nice.  There was nothing like this anywhere.  I think considerably more information on specific brands of lighting hardware could have been included too.  A case in point is the "resources" section of this book.  Conspicuously absent from this section are well-known lighting names such as Arri, Elinchrom, Novatron, and Profoto (to name just a few).      Unfortunately, the author also seems to waste a lot of pages on general photography topics such things as cameras, lenses, films, filters, tripods, exposure, metering and backgrounds.  One would think that someone interested in studio lighting has already mastered these basics.  Shouldn't a studio lighting book be mostly (or exclusively) about studio lighting?  Please don't make me wade through all these "Photography 101" topics first in order to get to the desired information.  The only reason for not giving this book a lesser "1-Star" rating is because of some outstanding photos contributed by such names as Peter Gowland, Brian King, Frank Frost, and others.  Most of those images were made with a 4x5 view camera.  The quality of these images is outstanding!  Amherst Media should have hired one of them to write this book.  The author used a miserable 35mm camera and 200-speed color negative film for his own photos.  You would think that he would have had more respect for his readers by using no less than a medium format camera, perhaps a high-quality portrait film such as Fuji Astia, and something better than just a makeshift studio for his images 
 Yes, Jordan writes well, uses words and descriptions beautifully. One of the many glowing blurbs on the dust jacket described it as "elegiac" and it certainly is, but elegiac only takes a book so far.  Beyond that, you need interesting characters that the reader cares about, set in a story that moves with a compelling narrative.  Perfect example, ATONEMENT.  Sadly, SHADE joins the pile of books I put down after wading through more than 100 pages. I could not finish it even though I was trapped on a long airplane flight with nothing else to read 
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 Much of what I thought has already been said, and probably better than I could say it. I've read many relationship books.  It just seemed like the Dr. was more interested in getting a book out and demonstrating to the reader that he's a smart and sophisticated guy.  Far too important and serious a Dr to be accused of writing a pop psychology book.  And he certainly hasn't. Feels like the book was written because he felt some sort of obligation.  The tone is pompous, the book wanders, and I came away learning nothing new 
 Unreadable...Maybe he has some good ideas in this book, but I wouldn't know.  I found his writting style completely unreadable.  I found myself having to read chapters over and over trying to recall what I just read.  The whole book felt like I was trapped in a never ending meeting full of middle management.  Painful.  I couldn't help feel like I was reading some lame new-age self help book.  If you are already in middle management or above, you will probably think this book is fantastic as it reads just like you talk.  But if you are in lower management or below and you see what's wrong with most company's mid and upper management, then you will find this book worthless 
 I have read the Book of Mormon more than 12 times in English and once in Chinese. If you plan to use the Mormon missionary methodology (read, ponder, pray) to find out the "truth" of the book, at least read Mr. Grant Palmer's book Mormon Origins first so you will understand the origins of the book about which you are reading and praying. Personally, I won't be reading this version of the Book of Mormon or any other version again. There are too many other fictional books that are more worth my time. Don't drink the Koolaid (unless you know how it was made). 
 I was very disappointed in the overall content of the book.  Very little insight into the game of football.  The author's view of race, religion, and politics added nothing but a few pages to the length of the book 
 I am also a fan of Basquiat and of Schnabel's movie.   I loved watching the taped interviews of Basquiat available at MOCA-LA during the last Basquiat exhibiit. (I believe they're available on YOU-TUBE now.)  I found "Downtown 81" extremely painful to watch as I felt Basquiat was being exploited by this film maker. For me, he was "produced and directed" and painfully not himself 
 I find the material to be a minimalized version of the true tools based in quality lean material. As a practicing continuous improvment specialist i expected more than I got in this trivial account of what should be considered a very important event in a corporate life cycle. Designing products requires exceptional detail. Likewise I expect someone writing a book on the topic to provide exceptional tools and details. This book is superficial at best and points you in a direction, unfortunately it is the wrong direction 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new "web 2.0" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis.  From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument.  The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance.  I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir 
 I bought this book on the recommedation of the Tom Peters' "50" books.  I've so tried to extract some value out of it, but Schrage goes on and on without seeming to get to the point.  This book seems to be a mismash of Shrage's notes collected over the years.  Yes, simulations change the way we work and interact, but how can we best use them to communicate ideas or speed delivery of new products?  I derived much more value from Tom Peters merely encouraging me to prototype than from "Serious Play" 
 Highly recommended,but,to many scenes of men bobbing around in a life boat. Little action scenes and those that were seen were not believable 
 Expensive...and after three months of daily use I can't say it has helped my blood pressure.  I record my blood pressure every morning at the same time...after getting up from nights sleep.  I use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises.  Then breakfast and 15 minutes on Resperate Devise.  My blood pressure hasn't changed significently in the last six months and I continue to take blood pressure medicine.  The Resperate Device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime - change in schedule hasn't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent.  I continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but wouldn't consider buying it again 
 The unabridged edition has 25 CDs. To abridge down to four is ridiculous. The story jumps around so much that it is very hard to follow and keep the characters straight. I was left wondering what the story was about, having just heard the highlights, like reading Cliff notes instead of the book. I subsequently ordered the unabridged edition 
 Clearly this night guard works for some people, but after wearing it for a week, my jaw/bite seems totally thrown off.  Yesterday I couldn't open my mouth more than an inch without experiencing severe pain and today my jaw still feels out of wack and is clicking and locking.   I returned it to the drug store where I bought it and they gave me back my money, but this jaw thing is so incredibly annoying and depressing, if it doesn't clear up, I'm going to go nuts. My advice: pay the money and get a custom guard made by your dentist, don't risk developing a chronic condition 
 I don't think I've ever written a negative review on Amazon before, and I'm sorry to feel compelled to do so.  But this book got in under my radar with the droll concept and amusing cover.  I feel as if someone who looked like they might become a new friend slapped me in the face, not once but repeatedly.  I avoid books that signal early on that they will be full of fat jokes or dripping with contempt for fat people.  As an author, I think that's the laziest sort of humor--like currying favor with prejudiced people by telling racist or sexist jokes.  Let those who find that funny subsidize such humor.  This book waited till p. 14 or so of what had been an amusing story, and by p. 47  I was offended enough not to want to read the rest.  Life is short.  There are many books. I don't have to read books that insult fat women.  I won't totally avoid other books by this author, but I will examine them carefully before buying 
 When I the reviews to this book I thought to myself: this is going to be the read of the summer. So naturally, I went to my local bookstore and paid $24.00. A few hours later, I went back and returned it. It was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere. I don't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless, with no execuse for its swearing. Literature isn't trash, Mr. Carey. 
 What more can I say?  This is one of the very worst cd's in the history of any kind of music. I got this as a birthday gift, and quite frankly ---I'm offended 
 The concept here is familiar childhood favourites of Connick's gussied up in new, sometimes wildly eccentric arrangements. On the plus side, it means you'll give a new ear to these oft-heard nuggets. On the minus side, only the most musically precocious child is likely to enjoy these versions...they're simply too far afield from what the tunes "sound like" for kids to key into. For the adults, the arrangements only occasionally really hit home. Too often, they're inventive but not a good fit for the songs they recast.  HIGHLIGHTS: MARY POPPINS' "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" is re-invented as a blast of Dixieland while Branford Marsalis' dancing soprano sax transports THE WIZARD OF OZ's "Ding-Dong! The Witch is Dead". The lurching bass line propels a piano-only take on WILLIE WONKA's "Oompa Loompa". It's probably one of the more 'artistic' arrangements here that really works. On another set of WONKA tunes, Connick plays it pretty close to the vest but "Pure Imagination/Candy Man" makes for a nice medley.  LOWS: I love the sinister opening to OZ's "Over the Rainbow" but it doesn't deliver on what it promises: it quickly turns into a pale version of the Garland standard. One of OZ's weakest numbers "Merry Old Land of Oz" takes it on the chin as forced jovial laughter from Connick leads into a version that doesn't make it seem any more "deep". The overwrought take here reinforces the tune's general poverty.  BOTTOM LINE: In the end, there's more misses than hits so probably only Connick loyalists will love it. But if you're hoping to expose your kids to different musical genres, you may want to see if your local library has it and let them dip their toes into Dixieland and big band (and jazz via "Oompa Loompa") on their own level.   2 1/2 star 
 If you're looking for a book on the Church Fathers, this one is probably NOT what you're looking for.   The aim of this book is to present church doctrine. It contains 250 headings that are chosen in accordance with the Cathechism of the Roman Catholic Church. Each one describes a point of dogma according to the Church's official teaching and offers some quotes from the ante-Nicene Fathers to support it. The point the writer is trying to make is that the teaching of today's Catholic Church doesn't differ from what the Fathers taught. If that is what you're interested in, then this book might be something for you.  For me, however, it was a disappointment. Willis doesn't let the Fathers speak for themselves, and the book doesn't really give an impression of what the theology of the Fathers is all about. Willis is trying to impose a medieval or post-medieval way of presenting the Christian faith on the patristic era. 
 This is my first experience with The Mars Volta, and it doesn't leave me eager to check out their other work. Maybe I'm just not cut out for prog rock (though I do love Pink Floyd), because all this was to me was a bunch of endless songs (when are bands going to realize that making a song 12 minutes long for no discernible reason is pretentious, not groundbreaking?) composed of unmemorable guitar riffs, too much feedback, and unnecessary sound effects. Most of the 12 songs on this album, all of them 4-minutes plus, feel like the band took the opening riff to a potentially good rock song and stretched it out ad infinitum. It's possible that a second listen to this one will change my opinion on it, but it's never a good sign when you spend the majority of the album wishing it would end 
 Buy "They Call Me Assassin" rather than spend your money on this release.  It is simply too dry a read; especially when compared to his first book 
    This book stunk.I thought this book was too short.I don't think many people like it because not even my teacher liked it.    I gave this book two stars because it was really confusing.It was really short.It didn't explain things well enough to understand.I don't recommend this book.  
 I read this book because I was desperately in need of something to entertain me for a rather long flight, and it was the only thing I could find on a shelf at a train station other than a few romances that I wouldn't come near with a ten-foot pole.  Anyway. On to the review -  It was tediously farfetched. Nevertheless, that could have been forgiven - it is fiction, after all - save for the fact that Baldacci simply cannot write. His prose is choppy, juvenile, and ineloquent (uneloquent?). While the plot was okay, the writing, simply put, was not. It was painful to read at times. Although mildly intriguing, this was poorly written and overall somewhat cringeworthy.  That said, it served its purpose, and was better than nothing for the flight. It was a tolerable read for the most part.  Baldacci's a decent storyteller, but a sucky writer 
 Rairly have I read a book that I hate.  This is it!  Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room.  Tony's fan base just lost one 
 This movie contained alot of nice visual effects and the sound effects were pretty impressive. However, for some reason Gong Li who is Chinese played the role a Cuban woman who was the lead actress in the movie.  It says alot about the Hollywood studios that they can't cast qualified Hispanics for leading roles even in movies that take place in or are about Latin America. This was a major setback to the film, it lacked believability, it was not genuine to me at all 
 Let me say at the outset that I am not a macroevolutionist.  However, Morris' simplistic caricature of biologists ("Darwin's theory of evolution is universally accepted among biologists", p3) is far from the only factor that makes this a disappointing book.  Morris is simplistic and repetitive, and in addition to the typo's already mentioned by other reviewers), there are several examples of outright contradictions and misinformation that leave me scratching my head.  On page 21, Morris states that "carbon-nitrogen dating...can rarely be used to determine the ages of rocks in geological formations."  In fact, it cannot be used to date rocks at all, only organic materials.  On page 25, Morris states that "The solar system is full of such [organic] chemicals, including amino acids-the components of proteins..."  I am not an organic chemist, but to my knowledge none of the amino acids found in the proteins of living things have been found anywhere else in the solar system.  If they have, it would certainly be in very limited places and quantities, not littered about the whole solar system, as Morris implies.  In addition, only 6 pages later, Morris states:  "Localized areas rich in organic chemicals are found in the fossil record.  These chemicals must have been produced by microbes of some kind."  Gee, I thought you just said that the solar system was full of them!  On pages 33-34, Morris states:  "It should not be imagined that they [the mammals] survived because they were somehow better adapted than the dinosaurs."  This statement directly contradicts the principle of natural selection, which is the guiding light for evolution and is even accepted in a general sense by creationists.  On page 44, Morris attempts to defend evolution by saying:  "Although many different kinds of genetic codes are theoretically possible, all organisms use the same one."  He uses this as an argument for macroevolution.  However, the logic behind it is fallacious, for the following reason:  genetic code can be (and is) viewed as a language.  As a creationist, it is perfectly reasonable to me that the Grand Author of Life would use the same language to code the information in all living things, just as most earthly authors write all of their works in a single language.    On page 45, under the heading:  Evolution is a Fact", Morris states:  "The idea that life on Earth has been evolving for 3.5 billion years is not a theory.  It is the only possible interpretation of the numerous different kinds of evidence that scientists have been discovering for well over a century."  Thank you, Reverend Morris, Pastor of the Darwinian Orthodox Church.  However, on page 62, Morris states:  "If scientific ideas ever became dogmatic, then no new discoveries could be made."  If ever a contradiction existed, surely this is it.    On pages 56-57, Morris gives the beginning of a reasonably plausible explanation for the evolution of an eye, until he says:  "Finally, full, complex eyes develop", thereby skipping the most problematic part:  the 20+ step biochemical process that occurs in complex eyes from the time that light strikes the retina until an impulse is sent to the brain.  (See Darwin's Black Box, by Michael Behe, if you want a fair discussion of the difficulties that the human eye poses for the theory of macroevolution).    I could go on and on, but I will conclude by adding that I could forgive most of the evolutionary dogma (which is, after all, almost universal in books written by evolutionists) were the book not incredibly redundant, error-filled, and simplistic.  I got a little bit out of the part about evolutionary psychology, but that it about it.     
 Ive listened to tracks from various albums and don't see why people like them. I mean, the vocalist always sounds like he's singing with a cold and I can't see anything spectacular with the instruments.  Even though I havn't given them much on stars, i'm giving them the one there because I see potential, I don't mind the "Wings of a Butterfly" song because it's a bit dark and has a catchy riff. But I'll have to be convinced to change my views. 
 I didn't find the book to be as good as her past novels.  It didn't hold my attention as well 
 I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan that has taken introductory biology courses both in high school and in college. Recently I helped my high school freshman niece with her biology reading from this textbook. I can't believe such a poorly-written book is being used in classrooms.  The book is poorly organized, even within individual paragraphs. Some sections seem as if a coherent paragraph was written, then someone randomly copied and pasted groups of sentences around until the text became as confusing as possible. Complicated concepts are confusingly presented without adequate explanation. Arcane details are given more attention than the overall concepts. There were many sections where I'd have to reread the text multiple times before I finally grasped what the authors were attempting to convey.  I think it's pathetic that anybody should be introduced to biology with a book this confusing and frustrating. Biology is NOT this confusing, and it's certainly more interesting than the authors make it out to be. This book isn't just useless; it's counterintuitive 
 Ella Enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when I heard that they were going to make it into a movie, I was estatic. I marked the movie release date on my calander, got my tickets in advance, and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater.  The movie was a huge dissapointment. While I wasn't expecting the movie to be just like the book, I certainly wasn't expecting that. While the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie, I hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book. The only common thread I found were the names of the characters and the fact that Ella was cursed from birth.  I suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie, it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears, despite the fact that I've read it over 100 times 
 Halley uses 17,000 ft. high Mt. Ararat in eastern Turkey as Noah's Ark's final resting place when the Bible says mountains of ararat in the book of Genesis. Also, old traditions attribute the Ararat range to a different area than where Mt. Ararat (formerly Mt. Masis) is located.   On other points he talks about humankind seemingly only 6,000 years old (as most Biblical versions claim if generations are taken literally in Genesis). Well, like another book written in the early 1960's (The Genesis Flood) this book is out of date badly on the age of humankind as DNA studies have since totally proven human life is much older than the few thousand years these books claim. Unlike the Genesis Flood this book seems to reflect the author's real genuine beliefs 
 I will usually read and accept anything, but this book is just so beyond fact for even realistic fiction.  I could have handled this book a lot better if there was no "Frankie".  The character Frankie is just too unbelievable.  I work with "talented and gifted" children that are Frankie's age (8 years old) and not one of them is even remotely this advvanced.  If Frankie was say, 12 or 13 I could accept her maturity, her dedication to her music and so forth, but this is not even believable to anyone who has a child or works with them.  It would be tolerable if Frankie was not the center of the book.  They spend more time about Frankie this and Frakie that, then on the main plot of the book.  This is the 3rd book that I have read or at least tried to read from Iris Johansen and it will be my last.  I just don't like the way she writes or her main characters.  Evertime I buy another one of her books I am always hoping that this will be the one that changes my mind.  Oh well, another book to donate 
 but Ridley devotes too much space regurgitating tired, old, discredited dogmas on both sides of the nature-versus-nurture debate. I think his views are self-evident to many non-specialists, like myself, outside the sociobiolgical fishbowl.     As a physical scientist, I am often disturbed by the (in my opinion) misplaced empiricisms of behavioural/social scientists. For exapmle, in one part of the book, Ridley describes a "remarkable" experiment that found children with a certain high-active gene (MAOA) are "virtually immune" to the detrimental effects of mistreatment by their care-givers, and did not "get into trouble much", as compared to those with low-active versions of the gene. The implication is that this could become a tool of social policy. The thought of engineers building Jumbo Jets according to principles of gravitation, mechanics, and fluid dynamics that "ought to work a lot of the time" would be a disaster in the making - much like, in my opinion, social policy built along the thinking he outlines. Personally, I would be much more interested in low and high-ative MAOA children who flaunt the conventional conclusions of the study (of which I assume there are some, based on the language). Perhaps it is the exceptions that hold the key.     I'm not saying that physics/math/engineering is superior to the social/behavioural sciences. I think that it is important to know where the fuzzy edges of reductionist-empiricisms lie, and where to draw boundaries around them. I just think that physical scientists, by the nature of their fields, tend to have better tools for drawing and testing these boundaries. Without these boundaries, there seems to be a temptation to take conclusions too far, and be lead astray as a result. 
 If you're a fan of this series, do yourself a favor and re-read Life Its Own Self.  I started Rude Behavior for the third time and ground my way through because I was DETERMINED to see what had happened to Billy Clyde 'n them.  Now I want back the hours of my life I spent reading it.  It's at least 100 pages too long.  The idea for the plot is good, (Big Ed and Billy Clyde buy and manage an NFL expansion team) but between the wooden dialogue, the two-dimensional characters, the anti-PC fulminations that even I tired of, and the lines recycled from other novels, the finished product is awful.  The only thing that saves this review from getting one star are the occasional original Jenkins-ism, like what he has Jim Tom Pinch say to the Golden Domer out in Hollywood 
 This looks to be an excellent book, but I strongly recomend you buy it somewhere other than Amazon  (unless you have 4-6 weeks to wait) I ordered it as a gift more than a month ago and have yet to get it.  The other book I ordered with it finally arrived sans the gift wrapping I opted for.  Well, at least IT came 
 I really can't imagine what might have encouraged those reviews above.  I found it exhausting to get through this--not particularly because the anecdotes O'Brien tells are boring but instead because O'Brien's tone itself is so off-putting, so agonizingly pretentious, that it actually ends up ruining what I think could be a very fascinating read.  I can't recommend this book.  Sorry 
 This product works ok as basic gigabit switch. It looks very nice for home office, does not get hot. However, I bought it not for nice looks, but looking for great functionality. Unfortunately, it turned out to be nothing but trouble.  GS608 is advertised to support jumbo frames (packets with size as big as 9KB - 6 times more than standard packet of 1.5KB). With properly configured network clients jumbo network can easily reach transfer speeds up to 80MB/sec and more. But with standard packets network can barely work up to 20MB/sec. So, this switch certainly does work faster than old 100MBit switch, but hardly 2 times as fast, when with jumbo frames it would be 8-10 times faster.    When I noticed that GS608 supports jumbo, it was huge factor for me to go ahead and purchase it. I wish I knew it was all marketing lie!      Upon receiving the product I was so excited so I disposed of packaging (I know - stupid me), only to find out day later that jumbo DOES NOT work (I am senior network engineer, and I do use jumbo at work with great success with more expensive switches). So I could not return or replace the product, and my multiple calls to Netgear support to resolve this were very frustrating and led nowhere - they just could not (or rather would not) understand what I am talking about.    So I am stuck now with basic gigabit switch, when similar model (not even pretending to support jumbo) could have been bought much cheaper from other vendor who does not do false advertising.    You decide for yourself 
 Maxwell's concepts of what a leader is is quite accurate.  However, I don't think he needed to spend over 200 pages to define what a leader is.  That's what this book came to be: one long, repetitive, obvious definition for leadership.  I didn't see these as laws so much as nuances of what he'd already said.  As a woman, reading this book was made more difficult with his overwhelming use of sports and male leaders.  The few examples he uses of female leaders are the few and the cliched (ex., Mother Teresa and Princess Diana).  A nun and a princess.  How many women in business are either of those?  Where are the examples strong, successful, inspiring female business and sports leaders?  I also found his use of his religious roles and examples tiresome.  What I felt that this book lacked most was more suggestions to improve one's leadership skills?  He suggests training, but not what kind nor does he provide exercises for developing oneself as a leader.  Another failure of this book is how he rarely addresses how a strong leader should deal with situations that aren't going well.  A great leader's abilities are best exemplified and most apparent in times of conflict.  I also strongly disagree that a positional leader isn't necessarily a true leader.  A positional leader is in nature a leadership role.  What isn't inherent in a positional leader is her or his ability to lead *well*?  One of the elements of this book I did appreciate were the pictures and quotes and the fact that the book is a quick read.  Other than that, I don't feel any more prepared now than I did prior to reading this book 
 The best thing about this book is the preface by Charles Rosen. The rest it hugely disappointing. It is amazing how a poet can be so  non-descriptive! How can any writer has been friends with both Mozart and  Casanova and yet have nothing to say about them? One gets no sense of what  life was like during the end of the 18th century at all. Even Da Ponte's  own thoughts and motives do not come across. All that is left are petty  political games at an assortment of different opera houses. Da Ponte's  story is less amusing than the description of a single flirtation in the  truly interesting and picaresque memoirs of his friend Casanova 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 I could see more artificiality from staring at the surface of a stucco wall.  This book presents planetary images taken by the NASA probes over the years.  Some speculate that there are some extraterrestrial intelligent activities present, not.  I see anomalies of light and shadow and just plain old geological activities 
 For me the only thing this book has going for it is a good title.  I, too, was annoyed with Rebecca telling the story backwards but that wasn't enough for me to dislike the book.  In this Picoult debut, one thing is glaringly clear and it's that the author doesn't write men very well.  All the sections supposedly in the men's point of view--sounds like a woman.  Their thoughts their reasonings sounded feminine--like what a woman thought a man thought like--if that makes any sense.  And quite frankly I didn't care for Joley.  His love for his sister borders incestuous (he wants to be cremated and wore as a necklace so he can be close to her heart?), and his character is never consistent.  For the first half the book he's practically rooting for Jane to leave her husband at any cost and then he doesn't an abrupt about face with no real reason behind it.  Plus, there are sections when I question his mental health.  Was he borderline retarded? Plus, why was he so stunned that she may have slept with his boss?  In his point of view section, he gave her to the man.  He wasn't thinking about his niece then.  I don't have a problem with fifteen-year old Rebecca falls for a twenty year old man, that's normal to have crushes at that age.  But then to have the man fall for her and then consumate the relationship is more than I can stand.  It's called statutory rape.  And yes I understand that Jane fell for her husband at that age, BUT Jane and Oliver waited until she was older before consumating the relationship. The author tries to go through great pains to convince us that Rebecca is not the average fifteen year old--she mature and yada yada.  Since when?  Lord knows her mother will let her talk to any man, encourage her to roll down windows to talk to strangers, let strangers gawk at her.  Then the girl hitchhikes with truckers she knows who want to rape her.  I mean, come on. Jane, on top of being a horrible mother, garnered no sympathy points with me.  Her behavior in front her impressionable child is horrendous.  She teaches her child how steal food from a diner, how to steal money from a car dealer (a bad one), and then have an affair with a man she just met in a bedroom next door to the child.  Whatever.  Then instead of being the parent and putting an end of the relationship or haul Rebecca fast-butt out of there, she meekly goes to Sam and gives him the ultimatium to handle it.  WHAT??  Jane doesn't want a child, she wants a best friend.  Then she susposed to be some sacrifical lamb when she returns home with her husband.  Jane needs therapy--plain and simple. Oliver catches her in bed with another man and literally seconds later he's kissing her.  On what plantet?  I can't tell you how many eye rolls I did for the letters across the nation Joley did.  How do you write a letter to the post office addressed to someone who doesn't live or work there?  This isn't the 1800s.   Bottom line: Oliver and Jane are both abusers who deserve each other.  Nuff said 
 Like a few others, I don't understand why this novel is getting so many positive reviews.  Perhaps I was spoiled by "Memoirs of a Geisha" and "The Good Earth", but I found the writing lacking and the dialogue boring.  Great plot line on paper, but I don't think the author did it justice!  Couldn't wait to just get through it and be done with it 
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 Charles Fort had intelligence, yes. But where do his theories stand now? For instance, his thoughts on the "raining frogs and fish" occurance goes like this: he denied the scientific theory that they were sucked up in a waterspout and made his own: that all lifeforms were created in a giant sargasso sea in the sky and occasionally intelligent aliens dropped them to Earth. He generalizes the entire scientific community in simple strokes, physicists, your doctor, astronomers, chemists, yes, he claims to debunk them all. Is evolution true to Fort? Nope, all life is created in the sargasso sea in the sky: Genesistrine, and is teleported or dropped by aliens to Earth. Crackpot lit 101: Charles Fort 
 When I was considering buying this film, I read all the reviews and though alot of them were negative, I decided to get it anyway because I am a huge fan of Jane Austen's books and like BBC's movies. I was very disapointed after watching it! This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I could not believe it! The music was much to modern for time period, and they made the movie much too creepy, whereas the book is much more lighthearted, though there are some dark parts to it. If you're considering buying this, I would advise against it. I hate to be negative, but watching this movie was a waste of time. 
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  Barbet Schroeder's film, a "self-portrait" of the infamous Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, generated much controversey and even death threats. Idi Amin himself demanded that Schroeder remove particular scenes from the film under the threat of killing french citizens living in Uganda.  The film is well written but almost appears sympathetic to Amin.  The DVD only has an interview with director Barbet Schroeder for a special feature, although the liner notes contain a transcript of a letter Amin write requesting the deletion of particular scenes.  This film has significance, but is not a good one 
 Housing Market is still going up. My own "views" is us seeing the houseing market slowing down and homes in higher cost areas to come down, one cause is because of intrest rates going up this putting most people out of the higher cost housing market. Lower and med price homes will stable off. And someone I read on this form said, her grandfolks wanted to buy a home to live in and stay and not do flips with the home. The stock market has return to pre 2001 if you only held and not pick up cisco and the yahoo ect kept a index fund your doing fine today, even better if you kept buying in the down turn. If your buying to hold a good house to live in maybe even buying a extra home for a rental just keep in mind wise words, just live within your belt and take it in one knoch. Ride the waves and if homes do come down in a crash or just a few rungs go buy some more, the market will return and start going up. Remember the housing crash in the 80's those same homes today are the same ones selling today for huge profits. Also Remember more people move to the USA every year, and this USA growth is not stoping. If there is a crash keep some money on the side and BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY. If there is a crash use it to get your retirement years in order buy and hold and when the market returns sell some and live on the rents of the others 
 I purchased this CD because I have been unable to locate the London production perfomed around the same time. This CD pales in comparison. With luck I may find someone who can enjoy this rendition. Does anyone know where I can find a CD of the London performance 
 Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane, two otherwise talented actors, completely embarass themselves in this absurd, trite and predictable "thriller" that turns out to be more of a comedy than anything else when all is said and done. Skarsgard and Lane play a wealthy couple who become the legal guardians of 2 teenagers when their parents are killed in a car crash. For some reason that is conveniently overlooked by the script, the fact that Skarsgard and Lane are 2 psychos is never realized by these parents, who have presumably known them for a long time. But of course, what place does logic have in this movie after all?  While the performances are all good, the actors can only do so much with the terrible script they're given to work with. Every plot "twist" can be seen coming a mile away. Some scenes even exceed the point of absurdity, case in point: when Skarsgard is able to take out an experienced police officer and then steal his gun. Go insult our intelligence somewhere else.  And what's with all the product placement? This probably earned the movie more revenue than box office sales. Shameless.   If there's any saving grace to this movie, it is Leelee Sobieski, although it's a shame that her breakout role was in this turkey. She deserves a script that equals her talent. But she is certainly nice to watch, especially the scene where she strips down to her 2-piece bathing suit revealing her bodicious, delicious, nutritious, I-want-some-of-that-icious body. But hey, when a movie has nothing else to offer it may as well cash in on sex appeal, right?  Rent this one first if you absolutely must see it. 
 Synopsis (including Ending): Don Ameche (Gino), a Chicago shoe shine man, is approached by the mafia to go to  jail for "3 to 5 years" to take the place of their Mafia boss accused of murder because  he bears a striking resemblance to him.  They'll pay him yearly and satisfy his lifelong  dream of fishing on a boat.   Joe Mantegna (Jerry) takes Don Ameche (Gino) on a 3 day  vacation to satisfy his every wish before he's incarcerated.  Joe Mantegna is on probation  from the Mob, after disobeying orders from a previous job.  Joe Mantegna goes   "outside channels" to take Don Ameche (Gino) to Lake Tahoe to the "Galaxy" Hotel  where they stay, wine and dine, and try to have a good time.  Things turn difficult  when a local real Mafia Boss brings Don Ameche (Gino) to his house as a guest and  they form a bond.  The real Mafia Boss has a gathering of crime bosses planned and  Don Ameche and Joe Mantegna are caught in the middle.  They escape the gathering  and on the day Don Ameche is brought back to Chicago, Joe Mantegna is ordered to kill Don Ameche and make it look like a suicide.  "It's cleaner this way...", he's told. Joe Mantegna refuses the order, and the film ends with a Mafia employee testifying in court and getting sentenced to jail for 20 years to life.  The Good: Joe Mantegna is an underrated actor generally and it was nice to see a familiar face in the real Mafia Boss in Lake Tahoe.  Other than that, there's nothing else going for this one except a slightly funny scene with the concierge.  The Bad: The Mob wants tough guys, right?  This is a comedy, right?   No ones a tough guy and there's no laughs.  Joe Mantegna plays a sissy instead of a Mafia tough guy.   Don Ameche plays a senile acting senior with no personality.    I wanted to like this film but I coulden't because it was very slow, very boring and none of the characters were interesting.     We never have a scene with the real Mafia Boss that looks like Don Amecha  and the two never meet.  You would expect a friendly "Thanks for going to jail  for 3 to 5 years for me" but it doesn't happen.  At the end someone for the Mob is dressed up like the real Mafia Boss and he's testifying in court and gets sentenced to jail.  He doesn't look anything like Don Ameche or the real Mafia Boss and yet, he's right there taking the fall. If the film didn't need to depend on Don Ameche's appearance, why didn't they send him to jail from the beginning?    The worst David Mamet experience I've had.  Very surprising stinker.  The Characters: If Don Ameche played a less passive character he would have been more interesting. If Joe Mantegna showed more conflict as a character with reasons behind them, he would have been more interesting.  As the film stands, they're both flat.  Don Ameche had no personality and his only lines are the ones other characters used.  When a character says something, you can be sure Don Ameche repeats it 30 minutes later like a senile robot.  Don Ameche's dialogue leaves a lot to be desired.   Add to that his boring and stale acting in this film.   He played very dumb, not interesting, like a real man in crisis about to go to jail for money.  Overall, Joe Mantegna was not believable as a Mafia hired hand.    Don Ameche was too passive and uninteresting, and Joe Mantegna is too  passive and stale.  Scene Criticism: A couple scenes stand out as being very weak and unrealistic.  (Gas Station scene where Joe Mantegna is given $3 more in gas than he asked for) Joe Mantegna is working for the mob, and he asks for $1 of gas,  and gets $4.  He doesn't have the cash to pay, and when the gas attendant takes the car keys his reaction is "Please, please, please" A real Mob guy would punch the gas attendant, take back the keys, and leave for the plane they were late for.  A mob guy that won't  defend himself for $3?  (Scene with Don Ameche offered money to go to jail for 3 to 5 years) Don Ameche doesn't put up a fight or try to leave the room, and is  too passive.  We don't learn about his past or his life or family.   There's not enough time spent on the offer, and the scene was over valued for it's lasting value.  (Bedroom scene with Joe Mantegna trying to let Don Ameche escape) Joe Mantegna had no real connection to Don Ameche's character to justify the scene.  Instead it's 2 strangers.      Personal Commentary: The test for a comedy for me is - "how many times did I laugh?" This film never made me laugh.  I'm shocked the film costs $24.99  on DVD.  Rent it instead.  It belongs in the $1 bin at Wal-mart.  Writing Criticism: Lines like "He's the guy behind the guy behind the guy behind the  guy" and lines like "A big man knows the value of a small coin" and the story about the grasshopper and the ant make no sense. The writing is drivel.  Alternative Recommended Film:  "Trading Places" with Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy and also Don Ameche, albeit in a smaller role 
 I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD. 
 Babies don't scare me except when I have to change a dirty diaper.  The storyline of "It's Alive" simply did not interest me and I found myself bored, bored and bored.  I don't think this storyline works very well and as a result I think the movie is largely ineffective as a horror movie.  If you want to make this into some kind of a politically motivated flick as a reviewer mentioned above, that is fine, but that's the only way anyone would be able to read any interest into this plot because the actual movie itself for entertainment purposes is sadly inept 
 A team must write this book because there is no there there.  Clarity is lacking. The author's voice is missing. I wasn't challenged and couldn't get excited about the areas described within. 
 This movie just missed greatness.  If it weren't for the acting and the script 
 This book is both original and good. The part that is good is not original and the part that is original is not good 
 The description of features claim the clock records outdoor temperature & it has no such feature 
 I saw this book when I was a child and wanted to read it then (it had a cool cover with a kind of blimp/airship on it).  Unfortunatley, life intervened and I only got around to reading it just recently.  Alas!  This book was a lot better and more wonder-filled in my imagination than it actually turned out to be.  The story is not very interesting, the setting is not well-painted, the protagonist's adventures are pedestrian, and the whole thing is swiss-cheesed with so much British slang as will likely put an American kid off his feed.  Skip this one 
 Better than Bloodlines, but still not that great.  Poor character development, and the fact that Conant has a tendancy to ramble make this book less than what it could have been.  I'm also getting rather irritated with the author's constant free advertising plugs for Eukanuba, Iams, and some other major brand names in the pet industry.  Are we reading an novel, or an informational brochure by Iams?  Is she getting paid to do this, or does she really believe that Eukanuba is the best dog food on the market?  (If she does, she's very ignorant on the subject of dog foods.)  I don't like my novels to tell me how I should be training or what I should be feeding.  I probably will not ever purchase any books written by Conant again 
 I gave this book two stars because some reader might want to open a studio for children's photography.  Anyone else looking to get into the photography business or improve photography business skills should probably look elsewhere.  The author's approach is to offer a topic related to the business of photography and to raise issues, but she seldom provides answers, and when she does, they are seldom of use to most photographers.  For example, the author has a chapter on lawyers.  In it she indicates the legal problems that a photographer might face, from copyright to leases.  Instead of telling the reader anything about these subjects, she says to hire a good lawyer.  As my kids say, duhh...!  Similarly she says there are several different forms of ownership that a photographer can use.  Therefore... consult a lawyer.  And when she does give advice, it is often wrong and dangerous.  For example, she says that in determining whether a person is a contractor or an employee, one should look at whether a person does the same job for several different people.  Actually, the government regulations provide 14 separate points that have to be considered with no one-point controlling.  Several judicial nominees have learned how important this issue can be.  But where the author really misses the boat is on the issue of marketing.  For any businessperson, including a photographer, marketing is perhaps the most important function.  If you don't have income, you don't stay in business.  But the tips the author gives only apply to studio photographers.  Marketing is different for a stock photographer and an editorial photographer, and for all the specialties in between, but Orenstein seems to ignore this.  I don't understand why this book needed photographs, unless it was to meet the requirement for 320 pages.  But if one is going to include pictures in a book aimed at photographers, they'd better be good.  The pictures in this book are muddy black and white pictures on paper with a low reproduction quality.  Perhaps it's impossible to write a book about the photography business that applies to all the specialties in the game.  I know that it is possible to write a useful book aimed at a specialist, because I have the example of John Shaw's "Business of Nature Photography".  Even though a little dated, it is probably more helpful generally to someone getting into the photography business than Orenstein's book is 
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good 
 I completely agree with the previous reviewer. The book was not helpful at all. It is not practical. It does not even contain examples of questions that are commonly asked during interviews, such as 'Tell us a bit about yourself', or 'What makes you a good candidate?'.   After being frustrated with the book, I went to the local public libraray and checked out a few books on the subject of job interviewing and also a few books containing questions and answers to the most frequently asked questions during interviews. The only difference between a law enforcement and civilian job interview is the second portion of the interview and that is the questions to hypothetical situations that commonly arise on the job. For this part you need good, solid common sense and judgment. Again, go to your local public library. You'll be surprised of the wealth of helpful information that you'll find there.  Good luck to all 
 We too, had the joy of trying to explain why a gift from Santa had a hole in it.  Now, the kids are so attached to the idea of having it, we had to call all over trying to find a replacement since Target put them on clearance.  We've finally located 1 but we're having to drive a ways to buy it.  I guess the fact that the price is down will make it worth the effort if we're lucky to find one without a hole!  :- 
 I just received my copy of "A Sense of Place" by Michael Shapiro, billed by the "Dallas Morning News" travel book reviewer as a great book about great travel writer's craft, lives, and inspiration. Most of the Amazon reviews to-date were glowing as well. As a travel enthusiast I quickly purchased and dug into the book and found a blatent hidden agenda. This author is clearly not seeking the great travel writer's adventures as much as he is seeking to underline his opinion that the world hates American policies and our current administration in particular.  Buyer Beware...his book embraces liberalism at its worst. Note two examples: Michael Shapiro on living in San Francisco..."but sometimes I think that we live in these oases of sanity" Then, he asks travel writer Jonathan Raban if he had owned a bumper sticker reading, "Somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot".  Perhaps this travel writer needs a good dose of a year or two of travel in the United States, yes, our "fly over" states.  Does Amazon.com give refunds? I plan to scrutinize your book reviews more carefully in the future for your reviewer's biases.  Don't mislead those of us who truly love to travel and don't want a so-called travel author's pedantic, self-righteous view of American politics. 
 I saw this movie yesterday thinking it'd be exciting. I sure am glad that I survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie. There's no story line, the acting is pathetic, whoever gave Vin Diesel the idea that he can act. Like an earlier reviewer observes it's about who's dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review 
 Like the other reviewers I also have a 3 year old who is crazy about Bob; he must have watched 'A Christmas to Remember' a thousand times (me too!!). But this christmas effort is very disappointing. He was so excited by the online reviews and sneak peaks, but has never asked to watch 'Snowed Under' again since seeing it for the first time at christmas. Hated the 'team leader' personality given to scoop - very confusing for my children too. Scenes were stretched, unnecessary boring bits were used to fill the time and the overall pace was slow - nothing to capture a child's imagination and enthusiasm. And way too much yodling too. My 2 year old didn't sit still for more than 10 minutes. Shame 
 I love PrintMaster.  I'm currently using PrintMaster 16 Platinum.  I have used many generations of this program with great success.  I have taught classes on creative desktop publishing and always recommended--even sold--PrintMaster, but this one is terrible!  Most of the images, even the previews, seem to be online and require a download which is very slow.  The thumbnails are low resolution and hard to see, so you have to download previews just to get a good look.  Most of the images can't be accessed at all, because there is a prompt for the intall/program disk.  There is no such disk.  There are separate install and program disks, neither of which satisfies the program.     Encore, which now distributes the program, does not support it.  Broderbund does not not support it, except through its website which does not address this issue.  If you try to phone customer service, you pay for a call to get an automated response which sends you to another response which tells you to go to the website.   Do not purchase this product without a money-back guarantee 
 I bought this book with great anticipation, however as I started the install it went to frustration. I know nothing of Linux when I started this, and it became a disapointment. The information in the book generaly does not line up with the Linux I installed from the CD that came with it. Also the comands that he talkes about wer not present when I tried them. allot of the setup comands you have to install manualy, I had to do allot of trial and error. His book is also badly organized I find, I found my self fliping to differant sections of the book for the same item. Some of the instructions for setup at the install are in the middle of the book. This may be a good book for when you know what you are doing, but I dont recomend it for the beginner 
 This is one of those academic texts over which programming fetishists salivate.  Those of us that program for a living won't find this book very useful.  There are some interesting algorithmic niches explored for procedural programmers that one in a million may find useful.  But truly Higher Order Perl isn't about functional algorithms, it's about object modelling.  For instance, why discuss the primitive concept of callbacks, when Object Oriented Programming is possible 
 Jonathan Conditioner is as good as a cheap drug store conditioner. Jonathan you can only fool people into buying one bottle of the cheap stuff, you can't fool them twice. I know we will all be seeing Jonathan Product on the clearence rack in a Big Lots with in a year or two 
 I figured I would check this out, just for kicks, and I guess that the most important thing that I can say about it is that it was a waste of my precious time and I will never get it back :*(  I only wish there was a "zero stars" option.  But guess what? No matter how much I might disagree with Mr. Fleeger's views ("oh, and you know I do!"), I RESPECT his right to use his second Amendment rights!  I would never suggest anyone throw away, burn or otherwise destroy this product because I find what he has to say wrong, which I guess is the difference between liberals like myelf and so-called "conservatives" this product showcases getting angry because the chicks dared express their opinions.    I guess that it shouldn't be surprising that those who very likely couldn't explain what the second amendment is about to understand how important it is for people (such as the chicks!) to use them.  
 I have read a lot of Michael Crichton and thought it intelligent and interesting.  After just finishing "Travels" this afternoon, I have to admit that I hated it.  I know that this book was about his inner and outer travels in life in which he reaches self discovery, but in reality it is one of the most self obsessed books I have ever read.  He whines and complains and tries to find excuses for his bad behavior and his inability to have a meaningful relationship.  Instead of looking at the international travel (as little as he actually talks about it) as a great opportunity to learn about other cultures for who they are, he is continually belittling and condescending.  His only real self discovery is when he turns to self help and psychics so he can talk about how wonderful he is and how misunderstood he is.  For all his money and experiences he could have had the same attitude anywhere, one of ego centered self indulgences.  Nice try but highly frustrating and diary-ish.  He should have kept this one to himself 
 Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
 Every summer brought the drive in my in-laws' car from Stockton to Santa Cruz. I was not a California native,only marrying into a California family so I was not familiar with the state's history.I just remember California seeming so vivid and alive.  Joan Didion narrates her family's move west and the intertwined history of the state and her family. Not only do we learn of family, but of the changes in the society. California has always struck me as a restless  state, ever on the move, turning to the next idea or trend. Didion follows her family's history, the eventual erosion of the ties to the land and agriculture and the huge immigrant wave. There are the huge industrial closedowns and the urban sprawl and growth. This is a book for anyone who loves California, but not nearly as revealing about the author nor her roots.  
 I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.  I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.  There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 Unfortunately, we have yet to see this movie because Amazon never sent our DVDs.  I ordered this and two other bull-riding videos for my son on January 10th, scheduled for delivery between 1/23-1/25.  Today, more than two weeks later, I received another email from Amazon notifying us that there were "delays with some of my items" and estimating a February 17th delivery date - 5 weeks after my initial order!  DVDEmpire.com had them shipped the next day - and $10 savings on my DVDs plus Free Shipping... 
 This is the most boring, unmotivating, uninteresting workout I have ever owned, yoga or other.  I am exceptionally disappointed, as it was voted best workout DVD of 2005 by Self magazine. I have only been practicing for a few weeks, having fallen in love with Fit Tv's Namaste workouts, I expected the same great music, flowing rhythm, and steady pace.  Instead, this is an incredibly slow-moving, dull workout that doesn't even challenge me, a true beginner.  I adore yoga, and wanted a longer, challenging workout--this is not it.  I'm back to my FREE FitTv Namaste workouts, until I can find somethng better 
 Don't buy this book, please! The man is a complete fake. He's degrees are totally worthless. He is making money off of people looking for help and tricked into believing his marketing hype. Just do some research on Google and you'll discover the truth about him 
 I have not yet read this book.  It looks exciting and I hope I enjoy it.  I am reading this book for a report in JROTC 
 As someone who was on bed rest for the last trimester of my pregnancy I can relate to the character in that respect.  However, the story is so-so.  There are much better reads out there 
 I have been reading the history of this period for over forty years. This is the worst bunk I have ever read. Here are my reasons. 1, He fails to cite his sources. 2,He fails to prove his thesis. 3,He contradicts the very title by stating that books never vanished from Italy, Greece, and the most Romanized parts of the western Roman world. 4,He pads the book with a ton of extraneous info that has nothing to do with the topics. 5,He inexplicably bashes other groups for no reason. Lastly, the so-called style is a disorganized, and incoherent rambling. I suggest that before anyone wastes their money. They read all of the reviews of this book wih a fine tooth comb and an open mind 
 As with the rest of the Brian Herbert/Kevin J Anderson Dune books, this is a clumsy, bungling attempt to continue Frank Herbert's mighty example. The quality of writing is at times so poor as to bring tears to the eyes of any fan of the original Dune novels. Were it not for the weight of his father's reputation, Brian Herbert would surely have been laughed from the world of professioanl literature years ago 
 I think, like many readers of the Anita Blake series, one question keeps coming to mind. Why do I continue to read her?  The reason is that there is always hope that the series will shift again.  Laurel K Hamilton has invested a great deal in Anita.  She is a necromancer, a succubus, and a panwere, with a very convoluted and confusing personal life.  She is also a Federal Marshal licensed to handle Preternatural crimes.  That is the part of these stories that captured many readers.  However, Laurel K Hamilton has not been paying any real attention to Anita's job, and has focused instead upon the ardeur- the power that makes Anita a succubus.  I tend to find this aspect of Anita the most uninteresting.  And this novel is no exception.  We have some new characters which promise some intrigue in the vampire world, but nothing ever comes of it.  Two of Jean-Claude's "friends" arrive to help celebrate an all-vampire dance troupe.  Both of them have ulterior motives for coming, and cause some problems.  But we don't focus on that.  Merlin, the leader of the Dance Troupe, makes a power-play against six Vampire Masters.  But we don't focus on that.  Instead, we have many sex scenes- some of which are just far too long and descriptive.  The plot seems to stop whenever this happens, and therefore, the story never really gets going. This was the exact same problem in the last two or three Anita Blake novels.  I love the character of Anita.  I have enjoyed watching her deal with her growing powers and her growing understanding of herself, while trying to deal with some interesting preternatural criminal.  But the last few novels have been solely focused on her growing powers and the problems they create. My problem is that there has been no resolution to these problems.  Anita has stopped growing and changing, and is becoming whiny and uninteresting.  In the preview of Harlequin, we find out that Edward is returning. We haven't seen him since Obsidian Butterfly.  Since that was also the last Anita Blake novel I could recommend to someone, I have hope that the series will shift into something worh reading.  We can still hope.  Which is why we're still buying her books 
 Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer. 
 It doesn't smell woody to me at all. Well, maybe a fake, pinesol-type of smell. It smells really artificial and almost chemical-y. I guess it's not so bad, and some people might like it, but I didn't 
 While Avalon aka Windows Presentation Framework is still in beta, I had hoped that the code examples and references in this book would not be far out of date.  I am finding that they are dramatically out of date (writing this review 04/27/2006).  This is not to criticize the quality of the book or of the content; it appears to be well written.  However, it was written in September 2005, and there has been at least 3 new beta releases of the framework since then.  About 1/2 of the examples I have tried will not even compile, or have bad runtime errors.  The "big concepts" are mostly unchanged.  However, I cannot recommend this book to anyone.  Programmer to programmer, you will be better off reading examples from online sources like msdn.microsoft.com and downloading new WPF tools like "Expression".  This book will find you confused with broken examples fast.  I look forward to an updated version when Avalon solidifies 
 One would think that this book would describe gang life more thoroughly. But, well over half the pages are pictures. Also, a lot of the rest of the pages either have a only few sentences or they are totally blank. I am very disappointed 
 I recently purchased this gate for an opening in my home that is 68 inches wide.  Within one week of use, the wood splintered apart in the center rendering it completely unusable.  I am returning the gate and puchasing the more expensive metal type.  This gate is a perfect example of getting what you pay for 
 I am very disappointed with your service.I am unable to view this dvd as it is not compatible with the australian system.I informed your company by email but received no response.I will not buy from you in the future 
 Hmmm... this one was, first of all, not nicely marketed. The real title of this album, as released in the 80's, is ''Lou Reed Live''. Its content is no more than rests from the ''Rock & Roll Animal'' sessions, which despite of being his best-selling album is not EVEN a register of one of his best live performances. The first time I saw this item announced here, with no cover picture and the 'live' thing excluded from the title, I instantly bought it hoping that it was a compilation of extended versions and that I would, for instance, get the complete sax session of ''Walk On The Wild Side'' and other nice stuff for freakie fans. But this has not been the case, and due to the misleading title I got a 3rd unnecessary copy of ''Lou Reed Live''. If you really know what you're getting here (so-so Reed live performances), then go ahead and complete your collection. Otherwise go check ''Take No Prisoners'' for the raw, real acid Lou or ''Perfect Night live in London'', ''Animal Serenade'' or ''Lou reed live Italy'' for more anthological live performances 
 The book is amazing; this movie adaptation is quite poor. Although the actress who plays O is quite beautiful, and there are some fairly erotic scenes, this movie is deeply flawed, and I can't recommend it. The plotline gets totally garbled, especially toward the end, to the point where it runs entirely contrary to the book's intention on several key philosophical and psychological points. Second, the actor who plays Stephen is absolutely one of the worst casting choices I've ever seen; doesn't fit the role one bit. So please, read the book. If you've already read the book and love it, it is probably worth your while to eventually see this film, but expect to be disappointed. 
    I echo the other comments made here.  From the packaging, it was unclear to me that one of the discs was only about Sparta.  That is the more interesting disc, but not what I was looking for here.  It seemed familiar because I had seen it on TV not too long ago.     The disc on Troy is totally disappointing.  The Nimoy show (Ancient Mysteries) is chaotic and tries too create too much . . . well, mystery.  I watched the third show on the disc a couple of days later and I was having a deja vu experience - the pictures and the script were often identical; just a different narrator!  Ouch!  That is a rip off.  The second show, on the gold of Troy, was interesting, but the 10 minutes of content are excruciatingly dragged out over 45 minutes of show. 
 If you have never read any of Sylvia Browne's book, don't start with this one. There is a lot of material in this book that refers back to other books.  
 I borrowed this book a while ago, hoping for an enjoyable light read. Unfortunately not.   The main character of this series, Amelia Peabody, is supposedly interesting. Unfortunately not. Obsessed that men are the evil of every age, her rants occupy almost every page. Her "supposed insights" and commentary were so long that I found myself speed-reading through the pages, scanning as many as 20 pages every few minutes.   The sidekick is just as annoying. While she isn't complaining about the weather, she is busy fainting.   Anyone who has read a handful of mystery books would already know who the "Mummy" was. What little intrigue there was, was ruined by the predictability.   Although the writing was quite enjoyable, it was ruined by many of the characters. I'd take one of the case studies of Sherlock Holmes over this any day. Or any book by PD James or JD Robb. 
 Reads like it was written by a high school kid.  An annoying high school kid.  I paid almost 14 euros for it in the airport and feel bad 
 There are not many books that I read that I find boring, but unfortunately this was one of them.  I was especially dissapointed after all the glowing reviews saying how funny this book was supposed to be. I found it very repetitive and dull. I also agree with other reviewers who wonder what the whole side-story about the tractor book was for. Those readings from the father's history book were especially boring.  It also took me more than a week to finally finish this since I just couldn't get into it. It was just silly episodes about the eccentric father and greedy, but supposedly, stunningly-beautiful Valentina over and over.  The author tried to delve a little into the history of why the sister was the way she was and about the horrors of war but then left us with no clear ideas about what she thought about these topics. We also never quite know whether Valentina is a good or bad person. Luckily I didn't pay much for this because I bought it second-hand from Ebay.  I wish I'd gotton it out of the library instead. Not worth the time it takes to read since there are much better books out there.  I learned nothing from this book and can't even say I entertained by it either.   
 This film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times.  It is not comparable to other great Westerns made during the sixties.  Eli Wallach is good but confusing--who and what is he after?   The color is good and it sounds like a Sergo Leone picure but it isn't.  What a shame!!!  It could have been made better--less comedy and more plot and of course --action and suspense!!!!  Buy or rent on your own if you dare----I wouldn't 
 This book is a travesty. I'm a history student researching the death of Captain Cook. My prof. who gained his PhD from Yale suggested I read this book as a counterpoint for how historical research should be done, and presented. Obeyesekere is way out of his league in this book. First he claims to be an islander so he can relate to the natives (in fact he is 1/2 sri lankan and the other half is european). From taht point it goes down hill. The man's arguments while compelling on the surface are completely unfounded. If you actually read the footnotes of his arguments they site often his own articles and essays, or take comments from European acounts out of context that when read do not state at all what Obeyesekere says they do. Do not get taken in by the popular denial of the truth of Cook's death. This book represents an obvious vendeta against historians who know what they are talking and have true expertise in the field such as Sahlins.Who knows ancient Hawwian traditions, is an expert in ancient polynesean language and culture, and studied in many places in the south pacific. Unlike Obyesekere who has no background in any of these things. This is another great example of a man who is way out of his league atempting to make a name for himself by rocking the boat 
 ...but I've suggested to some people that a name for this author that might be more appropriate would be Boris Lessing, as in BOOOOR-ING. Admittedly, I've only made it through 30 pages of this book but the  experience has been akin to watching paint dry while enduring a root canal.  I'd like to think I've the patience and the refined sensibilities to  appreciate the meandering pace and voyages into the lost depths of opaque  stream-of-consciousness prose, but I suppose I have a low tolerance for  pain... or maybe I'm jaded, in this day and age, where psychology is  simultaneously applauded and disregarded, conspiracy theorists have  appropriated the whole 'extra-terrestrial encounter' thing and television  has whittled my attention span to near zero... either way, this book  doesn't contribute much to my appreciation for poetry or science-fiction -  or the theater for that matter, given that much of the dialogue is written  as if it's to be performed in a play. A case of a text attempting to  transcend too many boundaries? In any case, not a book I would recommend 
 I heard about this book and unfortunately bought it before I could read the reviews here. I didn't know a book could be boring and over-the-top at the same time. Her descriptions of the punishments are so ludicrous and repetitive, that I found myself skipping them over. Beauty seems to have no personality or thought processes and the end is utterly confusing. All that said, I want to find out what happens in the next book! I just don't want to spend money on it! Hopefully I can find it in the library, although I doubt it 
 We thought that this book was on the boring side because there should of been more action or excitement. Our favorite part was when her grandmother came over. Our suggestions are to add more excitement and to make the book a little longer 
 This assessment of pre-Israel Palestine is best read in tandem with Prof. Yehoshua Porath's article in the spring 2000 issue of Azure. Segev claims here that the British came to rule Palestine with no clear idea of what they wanted. Segev supposes that a well-organized Arab nationalist movement, vigorously opposed to British rule, mounted the murderous Arab "revolt" of 1936-1939 and forced Britain to conclude it had no interest in Palestine and should leave. These ideas are ridiculous.  Why it took the British until 1948 to leave, Segev does not explain. As to voluminous evidence that the British stirred up Arab nationalism and the anti-Semitic revolt and joined in fighting the Arab's first war against Israel (as accounted by Col. R. Meinertzhagen, Samuel Katz, and many others), Segev keeps silent. Nor does he note that British general John Glubb commanded the Transjordanian army.   Segev asks political questions. 1) Why did the British conquer Palestine? 2) Why did they commit in 1917 to establish a Jewish National Home? 3) Why did they stay in Palestine? 4) Why did the British leave?   But Segev derides official British papers as too tiresome and voluminous to read. Segev bases his conclusions entirely on gleanings from diaries, personal letters, articles and books written by local Britons, Arabs and Jews, none previously consulted by historians--probably because they describe the social scene, not politics. The resultant fiction on Mandatory Palestine repeats the old Arnold Toynbee canard that Britain promised Palestine twice.   This conclusion is also ridiculous: Better accounts (which Segev ignores) are provided by scholars like Howard Sachar (History of Israel); Efraim Karsh (Empires of the Sand); Elie Kedourie (In the Anglo-Arab Labyrinth; Chatham House Version); David Fromkin (A Peace to End All Peace) and Conor C. O'Brien (The Siege); Samuel Katz (Battleground) and Bat Ye'or (Islam and Dhimmidtude: Where Civilizations Collide).   The worst aspect of Segev's work is his failure to note that Britain's conquest of Palestine was part of a calculated political and military strategy to establish a land bridge between the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. This, the British intended to enable their rapid deployment of troops to the Gulf, defend the Empire's vast East Indian interests, protect their territories from Russian invasion, and to provide an alternative to and protection of Egypt's Suez Canal. Segev claims that "[The British] gave [Palestine] to the Zionists because they loved 'the Jews' even as they loathed them" and feared them. He also posits that the British were guided something other than strategic considerations, and lacked an "orderly decision-making process." (p. 33) Good grief. Even if this were true (which it isn't) Segev hardly disproves the importance of the land bridge as the driving force behind British policy.   Segev also minimizes the importance and effect of Britain's 1939 White Paper, which slowed immigration of Jews to Palestine--mandated by the League of Nation in 1922, with international support--to a trickle. Britain trapped Europe's Jews inside Nazi-controlled Europe, denying them their one viable escape hatch. Segev, however, suggests that the White Paper had no practical result, since even the quota established was not filled. But how could it have been filled, when obtaining papers became so difficult in the aftermath of the White Paper? Honestly.  The White Paper exponentially increased the difficulty to European Jews of getting immigration papers, according to account after Holocaust survivor account, as well as work by esteemed Holocaust scholars such as David Wyman (Abandonment of the Jews). Besides refusing to consider a plan to save Europe's Jews, the British deployed 100,000 troops and a large armada in Palestine and the Mediterranean to capture Jews escaping from Europe and return them to that hell--policies the White Paper spelled out. Britain intended to limit Jewish immigration, and did so very effectively.   Once Britain opened Palestine Mandate and foreign office records, decades later, historians discovered that all correspondences concerning wartime immigration into Palestine, among other items, had mysteriously disappeared. In other words, Segev discounts the fact that British officials, obviously mortified post facto by their inhumane actions in 1939 and after, destroyed all especially damning evidence. Segev ignores the fact that the British in London and Palestine well understood the effects of their White Paper policy on European Jews. Segev's thesis does not square with the facts.   Segev also gives short shrift to the 7-nation Arab attack on Israel upon her 1948 founding, belying the Arab intention to destroy the Jewish state. Arab League Secretary General Azzam Pasha in 1948 promised "a war of extermination," "a momentous massacre" to be remembered "like the Mongolian massacres and the Crusades"-and gruesome acts followed. Israel lost 6,373 persons in the war, more than twice Arab losses--and nearly 1% of her population. Of these Israeli casualties, 600 were noncombatants abused, mutilated beyond recognition and decapitated by Arab captors, who were assisted by British military aide and blockades that turned a blind eye to illegal Arab gun-running.   Segev doesn't concern himself with the violence that preceded the 1947-8 war, who started hostilities--or why. He doesn't ask who needed to mount defenses or state the casualties on both sides. These is nothing here concerning British participation on the Arab side. In 1947, Israel accepted partition of less than 20% of the land allotted by the League of Nations in 1922 as a National Home for the Jews, while the Arabs begrudged Israel even that.   Much as I love books, this is one that deserves to be heaved out with the bathwater.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 I have 2 small businesses. I own rental property and work freelance. I'm also a professor, so I receive a pay check.  This book slides over some important and expensive details. For instance, it barely mentions that a home office must be used exclusively for you business. According to the tax man, it cannot be the guest room, too. And the author suggests setting up a trust to protect assests, without discussing the cost (not small) of that. These are just examples. Since there are problems with the information I have experience with, I wonder if the information I'm ignorant about is correct 
 Definitely not Freys best but with some judicious skimming you can read it in a few hours.  It is down to a penny used on Amazon and alas that is all it is worth 
 It's well known that 'Showgirls' flopped. I remember director Paul Verhoeven getting an award for having produced something like 'the worst movie of the year'.  It's not hard to point out its failure: the young & attractive lead Elizabeth Berkley cannot act. As Elizabeth is in focus quite a lot, her frequent appearance turns 'Showgirls' into disaster.  In hindsight it's incredible that an experienced director like Paul Verhoeven hired someone like her. I guess the blatant display of nudity in Berkley's role, as well as in this whole movie, made better actresses look elsewhere. The more so, while 'Showgirls' theme and plot are somewhat meagre.  One star for the effort, and another for the nice picturing. Any lavish display of female nudity cannot cover the failure of 'Showgirls' concept 
 Parts of this story are entertaining, but parts of it tended to bother me.  What really bothered me was that Harriet did some mean things to people in her class, but her nanny never told her that what she did was wrong.  She seemed to tell Harriet to pretend to be sorry, even if she wasn't sorry.  That attitude is what really bothers me about the movie and the book 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 Although this book contains 27 house plans, in my opinion only a very small percentage of these are innovative enough to warrant publishing. The most exciting being the design by Earth Rammed Works which could have  easily taken over the whole book and I wished it had.! Some of the designs  used new  energy saving materials such as photovoltaics, but these were not  given explanation space and left the reader feeling quite frustrated 
 I usually really like the Melvins, but this album is pretty dull.  The riffs are uninteresting and repetitive, and overall this is the most mainstream recording they've put out 
 Before buying this one, be aware that Mr. Gonick has very explicitly defined his political orientation in his own website. Read the forums, particularly his spicy comments about Bush and Kerry. Other cartoon guides (Statistics and Physics) were fairly immune to this sort of bias and somewhat enjoyable, but in this one, it cuts right into the meat. The topic is simply out of reach for anyone so blindly submersed (or compromised?) in either conservative or liberal order. Independent thinking, particularly for the writing (or re-writing) of history, is imperative 
 "Ten Things I Learned from Bill Porter" is ideal for someone who has seen the TV movie "Door to Door" or is otherwise ALREADY familiar with, and inspired by, the story of Bill Porter.  The book, unfortunately, is poorly written. Each chapter comes across as if it were conceived independently of the others. Biographical information about Bill Porter is repeated numerous times, and a fair amount of time is spent talking about the author's own life issues. Halfway through the book I found myself skimming paragraphs and whole pages, looking to get back to the thrust of the story about Bill Porter.  If you are looking for a biography of Bill Porter, this is not it. If you are very hungry for any additional information about Porter, this book may be worth your time. 
 For any of you teachers out there who plan to watch this in your classroom with your students:  BEWARE!!  First of all, I've heard of taking "liberties" with a book but this is ridiculous! Sex between Farmer Jones and the neighbor farmer's wife is not in the book, but sure is shown in the movie.  I was shocked to see them rolling under the sheet as the headboard was "knocking against the wall". Utterly revolting and embarassing for me and my students.  I expect better from Hallmark Entertainment, Family Home Entertainment, etc... Second, there is a "no rating" statement on the DVD - I'm angry about this and don't appreciate being taken advantage of. There was no warning about adult situations. It's a shame that one can't be truthful in advertising.  Buyer Beware 
 Period dramas are, by definition, delicate commodities: they're balanced on that, ahem, "razor's edge" between high brow and just plain fussiness.  I think "Howard's End" is a case of a robust novel buried in tea time and English lace.  Milliners, set designers and Helena Bonham Carter's hair stylist had their job cut out for them on this one 
 If you don't know anything about the SAT and want to study for it just a little bit, this is a good book for you.  This book is too short and all the stuff in this book and more are in Cracking the SAT so if you have that book, you shouldn't even bother with this one.  There are some questions that are exactly the same but appear in two different quizes.  Vocab on the back is the only good part of this boo 
 I bought the book on a recommendation a year back and tried to read it but failed to concentrate enough as it was a pretty dense book. Recently I picked it up again, this time determined to finish it as it is considered an important work.  I have forced myself and it takes forever to get through a single page. Either the author or the translator did a lousy job. I wonder if the original is easier to decipher. I ended up putting the book down on page 111 (a third into the book). Do not waste your time with this book. Foucault may have been a great philosopher who had an impact on many other scholars but I wouldn't know because i cant understand what he wrote.   HAHAHAHAH LET ME DEMONSTRATE WHAT I MEAN AS I QUOTE FROM THE BOOK (p.23), SEE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS SAYING ON YOUR FIRST TRY:  "Instead of treating the history of penal law and the history of the human sciences as two separate series whose overlapping appears to have had on one or the other, or perhaps on both, a disturbing or useful effect, according to one's point of view, see whether there is not some common matrix or whether they do not both derive from a single process of 'epistemologico-juridical' formation; in short, make the technology of power the very principle both of the humanization of the penal system and the knowledge of man."  NOT AS BAD AS FINNEGAN's WAKE, but it sure comes close 
 2 stars only because Rhino used single version and not the original long version.  Why do they do this?    When I read a book I read all of it not just part of it, the same is true with a song.  
 I bought this one because I was looking for a very hip Christmas album.  Knowing Peter White, what else is there but hip music.  Wrong.  This wasn't Peter White at all (except for 'Jingle Bells') - or not the Peter White I've become familiar with.  It was just another 'dime-a-dozen' Christmas album... boring.   If you want some smooth jazz hip music.. look elsewhere.  If you want to sleep.. this is the baby for you.  Just try not to snore too loud 
 The cover looks nice on this book and the vet listings were helpful but I found the lodging entries sparse and outdated compared to other online sources like Takeyourpet.co 
 I have read the government issued publication and this commerical version and I do not see why anyone would buy this version. Download the real copy and save your money. The team that wrote the book did an awesome job. The real free version is a must for any serious student of CB warfare. 
 I have had this sweeper for several months and like others, it's main purpose was to keep my kitchen floor, laundry room, and basement floors clean. Well, it does pick up larger debris best, but when you go for picking up hair, dust and dirt, it blows a lot of it around, not to mention, I noticed that the entire sweeper itself becomes COVERED in dust. Don't buy this sweeper if tou expect it to "suck" things up. It provides NO suction but a motorized brush roll that spins and rolls things up into the dust cup. I recommend this for occasional use for spills like cereal, rice, etc. As far as being a tool to "clean" your floors, you will be quite disappointed. In fact I only use this now to clean my laundry room area and basement floors to pick up debris so it doesn't get tracked in my upstairs 
 This is just another re-hash of the 2001 Gaye compilation with one twist.  The "Gold" series that Universial is releasing now comes copy-protected so you can't burn a CD-R copy for your car stereo.  Plus they want you to spend more thinking it's something else.   That's why I boycott copy-protected CDs.  Think about it.  Why else would the eariler comp be deleted from Motown's catalog after ONLY four years 
 I purchased this book to help me with ideas for homeschooling my children. This book is the longest in my collection but it is the least informative. The first 100 pages or so deride the current efforts of public schools, yet offer little advice except "turn off the television" and "read to your children". The most interesting and helpful information in the book was taken directly from the Core Curriculum Series, which is a useful resource for parents who want to ensure that their child is receiving a good education. This book is preachy and redundant 
 I bought this cleaner because my house is all hardwood and I have two dogs.  I was hoping that this would help to give my floor a nice deep clean.  It actually didn't clean anything at all.  I couldn't get up the dog drool spots which I have to scrub out, but worse it didn't get rid of water spots which I can wipe up with a paper towel.  This may work for tile, but wouldn't bother if you have hardwood 
 My son did a book report on this book. I found it unsuitable for children under 13 to be reading it. Brian's Hunt has maggot filled, dead human bodies, and human dismemberment. And a moral to the story which was, the bear had gone to far, it was not right. Brian would find him and kill him because it was personal. So if someone does you wrong and it's personal we should kill them? Is that what we want our children to learn. How does a wild bear go to far when you're in his back yard?  Our children cannot see movies with this kind of violence in it under the age of 13. But they can pick it up at any library , book store or school. No restriction for it's content? We have it on music, movies, and even television. Why would someone think this book was age appropriate. It says for ages 9 and up.  
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 Just another Beatle acquaintance cashing in on Beatlemania. Who gives a hoot if Lennon was bi? Not me. If you want to explore that topic, I suggest the film The Hours and Times. I gave the book one star becuase I dig the picture of Lennon on the cover 
 not being hip, I must venture out and say:    Oh my God!!!  What????  Who cares?  Franny is pregnant.  The big twist in this story was that it was in the 50s.  But beyond that, what's the point?  Take out the pregnancy and we are left with hyperintelligent, overanalytical, pretentious young adults whose parents did them a disservice by never offering them a real childhood.  Boring in the 50s and boring now.  As a fan of Catcher if the Rye, I couldn't wait to get my hands on Franny and Zooey.  Holden was familiar.  Franny and Zooey made me want to shower.  I really wish I had the time back that I spent reading this trite piece of...         
 Conventional Lampworking generally refers to soft glass, but this book deals with borosilicate or "hard Glass".  Since I wanted a book on soft glass "moretti" I was extremely disappointed 
 It came missing 4 different pieces, including hardware to put it together. The instructions were stapled backward and I found three typos on the first few pages. (I'm glad I read all the instructions over before starting.) I am usually the one in our household that assembles furniture, because I usually enjoy it. This was just a pain in the ass, though. I am more than a little annoyed at all of the stupid stickers they felt the need to label everything with. I had a lot of sticky residue to clean off when I was done, although most of the stickers are in inside or bottom places, there were a few in the front and on top as well. This is the first time I've ever assembled anything and had problems with cam locks, too. I came very close to taking it back to the store, but it was a gift and I had no reciept. It looks gorgeous assembled, but they really need to do something about the packaging. There is no excuse for missing so many pieces 
 I bought this tape for a friend of mine.  They played it once and it "unravelled" and couldn't be used again 
 ...in the previous reviews. This is, simply, a screed. Imagine Ann Coulter on a bad day, and you've got an idea of the tone of the book. Not that it won't appeal to a certain segment of the "reading" population for precisely that reason, mind you, but for most people, it's something to be avoided. Like acid. It's not inconceivable that some would disagree with the current administration's policies. But pure venom and hate isn't going to carry the day 
  Ironic that a novel by a writer who despised penny pinching and greed would have his novel published in such a way that to make a few more bucks the publisher makes the book literally painful to read.   The text is simply too crammed on the page, following lines of text is awkward and the lack of spacing simply makes the book painful to read.   Theres other editions of the book that are cheaper and properly spaced. What a disappointment this edition is. Shame on Signet for this ridculousness 
 As a Construction Superintendent I previously used the sixth edition and was looking forward to the new 10th Edition. What a disapointment. Much of the useful text has been replaced with useless dimensions for every type of furniture imaginable. Many chapters have been stripped down to brief over views, and turned into "that's what this is called" details.   If that's the type of book your looking for there are many other less expensive options out there.   If you need serious details, try some of the previous editions since the means and methods of construction don't change significantly. You may find some of the newer materials aren't included in previous editions, however, what good is it to you if the 10th Edition only shows you a cross section of the material 
 I enjoyed this book, but also felt the author is a little to close to the subject, and has not much objectivity. Also, I think, being it's a book about the Fitzgeralds, she should have cribbed a few passages from The Great Gatsby. I would loved to have been reading about old Papa Kennedy conning Gloria Swanson, and discovered he had "temporarily lost interest in the abortve sorrows and short winded elations of men." If you're going to steal, Doris, might as well go the whole hog 
 There has never been a marriage more controversial in the American public eye than this dynamic duo. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have been rumored to have questionable personal lives since Bill was the Arkansas governor. While this has certainly been proven true, "Bill and Hillary" acts in the same fashion as "Year of the Rat" by Triplett and Timperlake in that it pulls all the punches and makes connections and assumptions that are iffy at best. While there is no doubt both Bill and Hillary Clinton have been proven to be not- so- faithful to their wedding vows, the idea that Bill engaged in cocaine use and street- side sex with a prostitute could not be based on anything more than hearsay. The accusations are certainly interesting, but much of them seem to be no more than sleazy yellow journalism 
 This is a good book if you are twelve years old, or know nothing about vegan or vegetarianism.  I stopped reading on page 42 at the line "Carnivores are physically designed to hunt, kill and devour their quarry quickly and painlessly."  Right.  Being ripped apart by teeth and claws doesn't hurt at all.  This book is repetitive of basic ideas and contains such biased and unrealistic fantasys.  Don't get me wrong - I am trying to transform myself into a vegan.  I believe it is the right way to live.  There are just better books out there about veganism 
 I just wanted to let you know about a copyright situation. In this movie there is a part where they are sitting in a mexican food restuarant and there is a song playing in the back round. That song is not listed on the song track and I think it should be. The song is Atrevido by Orishas. I think this is wrong. 
 This book is useless and a big waste of my $... that I paid for it.  While the book is some two hundred pages, the last hundred consist of appendix which could be summarized in less than twenty.  The first hundred pages is so completely elementary in nature that I cannot conceive of anyone actually benefiting from its content 
 Even as a joke, this would be horrible; however, I think this band take it seriously - and it blows!  I picked up this CD because I heard A.R.E. were like a combination of suicide, front 242, and iron maiden: Interesting.  NO!!  A.R.E. are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down Liars at best.  The guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse.   Example: "Hey World" begins with how much it sucks to be 13.    When I saw Pelican in concert, they were opening (?!?!?) for A.R.E., so I decided to give them a second chance.  The sound guy must not have liked what he heard, because the bar chatter was louder.  "Louder" I yelled, so that I might find something redeeming in their music.  "Yeah, SUCK louder!" Someone else yelled - I had to agree & give him a high-five.  Maybe I would have liked this when I was 12 and didn't know any better.  ZERO STARS 
 This is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills.  It would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner.  The shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery.  The politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray; I can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script:  Bong-hitting liberal student who has no clue about the real world #1:  ...and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing... BHLSWHNCATRW #2: (Interrupts)  "Evil Corporation"?  Why are you being redundant?  The only plus for my wife and I was the acting, which was great.  Fiennes was especially good, underplaying his character in the early parts of the film, resulting in a character with depth and nuance.  I only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it 
 Although the revised editions of the Nancy Drew books never lived up to the originals in my opinion, the writing was always decent...But then around volumes #27-#30, it really started to decline,and became what I call poor quality. It seemed as if the writer('s) really did'nt care what thier readers would think of thier work, just as long a they got thier pay check, they were happy. And the art is atroucious! The cover paintings arent too bad, but its the illustrations inside the books that really show the lazziness of the artist. I really liked the original illustrater's (which was Russel Tandy) approach. He would first actually read the whole book before going to work, unlike Nappi who would doodle a few pencil drawings that looked as if they came from a generic color book from Big Lots... I dispies this garbage.. 
 If you're learning to use Maya, this is NOT the book for you. from the get-go, the instructions are NOT clear on what they want you to do. The Solar System was a few pages and it took me 3 weeks to do it because I had so much trouble. They tell you to rotate things but they don't say by how much or what direction. and they leave you in the cold. Stay away. Now I may be hasty because I'm learning maya myself, but this book is NOT helping 
 The book is obviously well-researched and the chapter on The Riders was interesting.  However, the author included a lot of details that just really didn't matter-as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts.  The photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book. My professor was able to bring Dr. Schrag to talk to our class.  He was a good lecturer-keeping the class' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the Metro.  If he could make his writing style more like his teaching style, I think he would have much more success as an author 
 Paul Tibbet should have been tried as a war criminal. I don't see anything to celebrate about on this 60th anniversary of the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Perhaps the Japanese are rethinking about these events today and can write their own versions of what they think of these two genicides. Whether it saved lives or not is speculation, just that speculation.  We all know how speculation is viewed in a court of law 
 the track selection is fine and okay, but the track order is bad. No FLOW! proving that he just took popular tracks that other big djs are spinning and sold an album without a smile. the mixing is terrible and abrupt, its basically not mixing. no art there.  
 I wouldn't recommend this book at all for one your better off going to see the movie because the book tells a whole bunch of different stories which leads you in different storis instead of just talking about the same thing the whole movie. I would just recommed seeing the movie over the book 
 Very nice prints, but the quality of the briefs is not good. To top it, one of the briefs was even damaged. I guess the maker doesn't have a quality control department. Overall, a bad buy. 
 Easily my favorite band of all time... which makes the reviewing even tougher.  Skimmed through this at a book store in an afternoon.  Not much more needed time wise as there isn't much more added to this book which any fan of a musical act hasn't known or read throughout hundreds of interviews in print over the past 20 years.  While the rampant drug use was a surprise and how the band saw their lead singer spiral out of control (the fight with Gary involving a knife at the Capri sessions should have been a STRONG INDICATOR that something is horribly wrong with Hutchence), there is little excitement which engages you to read further.  The details concerning Michaels' death are hard to digest as one can't shake the feeling from their point of view, albeit, after-the-fact, that Hutch commiting suicide wasn't something they could have helped prevent.  All in all a disappointing read for the lack of insights and a true feeling the band was telling "their story". (Pick up The Dirt by Motley Crue for "how it should be done").  For one of the worlds most visual band who launched a new standard for the video medium also found the visuals sorely lacking.  As INXS enter a new chapter, can't help feel that this bookend to their most successful points of their lives... leaves you wondering mostly:  What could have been... had Hutch stuck around.  What could have been a better book, a better story, a better ending...  
 It has some of the songs I am looking for but I am looking for Jingle Bells, with Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canidians. The alubm is from the fifties.I have the album but would like it on cd 
 Shame on Routledge for touting as a centenary edition this dog, riddled with egregious typos ("simiotics"? "ernestly"?), whose footnotes refer one to pages on which that which is alleged to have taken place does not, in fact, take place. I like the intros, and the very spacey Micky James foreword. But Routledge does not deserve the $18.95 I gave them for this book, which is, apparently, in the public domain, and which I can read, without typos, online. Shame!!!! 
 "When will it end?? NEVER! MUWHAHAHAHAHA!"  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****  First off, up until this point, I found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). Granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of Jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. For instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. Realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good "thumping" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (As would anyone really). Instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. It's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. Even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. Hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. There is hardly any Logic here, and when someone who is supposedly "Wise" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. Most of the so-called "intellectual" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.  Human characteristics aside, Jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (Clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) Hardly anything is left out. I suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that Jordan has created.   But here we are...at the 5th book. I hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. Sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. Jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. This can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. I'm a little undecided on that.   This book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:  1. Most of the men can't think for themselves (However there are a number of Characters that I do like allot. Uno, Julian, Matt, Asmodean, Lan, Thom, Loial (Who isn't even in this one..go figure) What happened to Elays?? Uhg..  2. The female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter  3. Rand's increase in the One Power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. It all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the Dragon Reborn (End of Book 1 I believe). It takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. This is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. Rand attains the 'Sword that cannot be touched'. A weapon that can level cities...What does he do? Shoves it into the floor at the Stone Of Tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. Wow..smart huh?   4. The Forsaken are scheming as usual. It's a mystery to me that they were picked by the Dark One. Powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. It would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate Rand. They could. Everyone knows they could. But they don't...Frustration level ever increasing...  This series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. Jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.   Something that I must point out is the way Jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the "Evil" characters. This whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. I believe it is wrong to kill off so many "Evil" characters at one time. Characters that have potential are eliminated.  And yes...Asmodean. Here comes my biggest gripe of all.. I rather liked Asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the "Evil" side, to "Good" side (Even if it was un-willingly). He does provide a lot of insight for Rand. If I was a Forsaken, I would defiantly cross over to Rand's side, it only makes sense. BUT...Instead of keeping Asmodean alive and allowing him to help Rand with his great struggle...He's killed off at the end of the book.   Right there, Jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. Then Rand goes on to Kill Rhavin. Another interesting Character wasted. Lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). Again, another interesting character wasted. I could care less about Moraine. After the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.   All in all, Jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (Hurin, Ingtar, Elays etc..) And keep the boring, immature ones. (Nynaeve, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha etc...)   The series is simply too long, and I'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. If Lord of Chaos is as bad as this one, I'm burning my collection and sending the remains to Jordan's house.   So, to those who are in the midst of this series like I am, I say to you; 'Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'.  
 There are 149 5 star reviews and 92 one star reviews.  This is more representative than an analysis based only on the last 20 reviews. But what is more notable than that is the fact that  the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them.  Lone Nut Theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false.  Posner totally disregards the Parkland Hospital Doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head. He would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot. That somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts.  To expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting.          
 From the book of Genesis:  4 And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death. 5 For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.  Run as fast as you can from this New Age lie! Satan is deceiving you. Jesus Christ is not just another 'master'. He is the one and only Son of God. There are no 'masters'! Only God is master! So forget your pride and serve God in humility 
 I wish I would have read these reviews before purchasing this movie.  I cosign with everything everyone else is saying.  I too remember what this movie was like when it first aired.  Not only have the scenes been edited or deleted but the order of some scenes were altered as well.  I love this movie but I am disappointed in this dvd.  The dvd is supposed to have added features, not features taken away.  I should have known it was too good to be true, it was only $7.50!!  If it isn't broken.........ya'll know the rest 
 There are at least two types of eloquence: one is stating the case in a manner that those already in agreement will applaud, and the other is arguing persuasively.   Kaminer's book has been hailed for its exhortations and wit by foes of the "self-help" movement, whatever that is exactly.   Fans of the books that she criticizes are undoubtably outraged.  The skeptical will be unimpressed.    The irony is, one of Kaminer's chief complaints about the somewhat ill-defined self-help movement is that it blunts our critical thinking: she wants a nation of critical thinkers who won't analyze this book too closely.  Kaminer doesn't offer any analytical evidence of how the self-help movement actually affects our society, she merely utters extremely vague warnings" "imagine the effect ... ."   Nor does she have much evidence as to how people typically use self-help: a reader might gain useful insights without letting the book rule their life or joining a cult around the author.  The "self-help movement" is a phrase that is tossed around a great deal, but what is Kaminer actually referring to?   Any book that lumps together Norman Vincent Peale, Wicca, Alcoholics Anonymous and M. Scott Peck is covering a lot of ground.  (It has never occurred to me to think of Wicca as a "self-help movement"; I guess Kaminer just doesn't like it and decided to throw it in for good measure.)  All of philosophy and theology could be thrown into such a broad categorization.  It would have been better if Kaminer had stuck to specific criticisms of specific books instead of trying to generalize about such a variety of works.  Kaminer's main arguments are two - one is that if you agree with her, the two of you will share the pleasure of sneering smugly at others.   Secondly, she keeps informing us that whatever it is doesn't appeal to her as if we should be just overwhelmed that ***!!!!Wendy Kaminer!!!!*** doesn't approve.  I actually read this a long time ago.  It came back to me when I was reading Paul Collins' fascinating Troubles with Tom: the Strange Afterlife and Times of Thomas Paine, and read the discussion of phrenology in the early 19th century.  Kaminer seems to assume that all this is a recent phenomenon, falling back, I suppose, on the common tendency to think that things are going to pot these days but were much better at some vague time in the past.  Actually, books of advice have been extremely popular since the the printing press made reading materials generally available: they were the best sellers of 16th century England.  Moreover, most of these books are based, legitimately or otherwise, on psychology and/or religion, both of which predate our time.   Kaminer has indicated a respect for psychology in other books, and religion certainly preceded the founding of the Republic that she argues is now endangered by self-help books.  So what has happened?  She compares, for example, a belief in the 12-step higher power with devotion to a political demagogue.  In the first place, a disembodied, individually conceived "higher power" is not capable of running for President-for-Life.   In the second place, how does this differ from religion in general (which Kaminer never directly deals with)?   Indeed, religious movements seem to me to be far more likely to be used for demagoguery: when was AA a voting bloc?  Some people do get pretty silly over these books, but is that because of the book, or because they're silly?  Are their individual lives actually better or worse without the book?   I know several people who work professionally with alcoholics who think that AA can be tremendously helpful.   Sure, it would be better if no-one was inclined towards alcoholism, but that isn't one of the choices.   The members of AA, et al., feel that they are better off with the program than without it.   Kaminer gives us no reason to believe that she is a better judge of what is good for them than they are.  Toward the end of her book, she expresses her hope that we will drop all this nonsense and learn to think sharply and insightfully.  She doesn't explain how she expects people who are too moronic to read these advice books critically are supposed to affect this transformation.   
 I read the book because I had heard good things about it.  I was disgusted by what I saw.  I've always been a moderate, so this is not the ramblings of some right wing nut who just hates liberals.  Ted Rall hates America with an almost satanic passion.  After reading the book, I went online and searched for Ted Rall's cartoons.  These cartoons are even worse than the book.  He advocates the deaths of our soldiers and makes one cartoon actually claimed that ALL soldiers are rapists and sadists.  Ted Rall is a sick and twisted human being.  Do not send any of your money to this sadistic and anti-american nut 
 After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.    I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.     Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:  "Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."  It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow. When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.  I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them 
 As a stand-alone story (not a "prequel"), this book is relatively fun - if you can ignore the countless glaring grammatical errors and typos. I can't believe this made it past editing!   As far as being a prequel to Barrie's Peter Pan, this book misses the mark. There are too many blatant inconsistencies for this to be anything but a shallower "re-telling" of Barrie's richly woven classic. These are not the characters we knew and loved; this is not the Never Land we dreamed about at night. Pixie dust is now nothing more than "space dust" which causes strange and unpredictable genetic mutations on contact. Need I say more 
 I got the book.  Signed up for the website.  Then didn't have time to study for a while because of work.  When I finally had time to use the book and study, my internet access (where a lot of important suppliments are) was cut off because it was passed the assumed amount of time.  I tried getting it restored, but Kaplan was no help.   1st-They kept connecting me to the wrong departments who were too busy to talk, so took messages and never returned your calls. 2nd-Didn't respond to emails 3rd-After 4 days of trying to get in contact with the right department, I found out at Friday at 6pm that the people who could help me are closed from 5pm and the whole weekend.  So now I have to lose another 3 days.  This is very frustrating for someone who has to work and is limited with time.  The phone opperator said this is a common problem but Kaplan does not care to spend the money to have employees over the weekend.  DO NOT USE THIS BOOK, THE SERVICE THAT COMES WITH IT IS TERRIBLE 
 I was very much disappointed with this album.I really didn't need to hear of all their problems in life.I did not purchase this album to hear them talk about themselves, I wanted to hear their music, which on this album there is very little. I am sending this album back to Amazon. Stay away if you are looking for music. 
 I'm from Calabria and also found myself upset at the lack of any books regarding my region, so I decided to read this one considering it was the only one of its kind. After reading I was thoroughly disgusted and plan on emailing Mark Rotella personally letting him know, that maybe the reason he couldnt quite figure some things out is because he traveled with a guy he just met and the fact that he's not even full Italian certainly dosent help matters. Not to mention, he claims to be connecting with his roots but is clearly 100% Americanised and coming from parents who quite honestly seemed to shun thier past for the luxuries of the states. Some of the sentences were accurate, however most were not and after actively reading this book and have more than a few things to tell this author, and i think i speak for the entire Calabrese population when I say, if you're not from here don't try to write a book about here, especially one riddled with generalizations and ignorant statements.   P.S. The whole fica vs. fico thing was completely unnnecessary as well as crude, and that goes for comparing the name of Calabria to a prostitute, if thats the magnitude of your descriptive writing I suggest you find another job 
 Having had Norton products installed for years including AntiVirus, Internet Security, and SystemWorks, I decided to replace the installed products with Norton 360 and a non-Norton password manager.  Obviously, it is critical to FIRST remove all Norton programs before installing Norton 360.  The installation process proceeded relatively smoothly.  My computing environment includes a 1.6Ghz processor, 1,000MB of memory, and 6GB of available disk.    The background scans and LiveUpdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire CPU at 100% CPU utilization.  One application that streams radio broadcasts now stops.  I immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups, however, the CPU occasionally still locks.    Additionally, there is no way to transfer security settings from previous Norton products to Norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive.  If you now have separate Norton security products and are satisfied with them, save your money and renew the Norton subscriptions. 
 What an awful product. After less than a week of use, the camera will no longer connect to my wireless network. Even when it did, it kept causing the wireless router to crash several times a day. Recording settings for the camera software were lost if the computer was re-booted. The instruction manual is poorly written and doesn't even accurately describe the software interface. Save your money 
 Regardless of the new extras and restored scenes, this dvd has a terrible video transfer. Horizontal edges have more edge enhancement than even the infamously bad SWEP1 Phantom Menace dvd. The overall picture is reduced to near vhs quality from the excessive ringing.  Absolutely avoid this Z-grade transfer unless you have a 13" tv or don't care at all about video quality 
 This guide is written in French and is utterly useless to anyone who does not speak French 
 I never got to use this sheet. I pre-washed it and put it to dry on low heat as I've done with all the baby clothes. I later saw the label said to air dry, which seems ridiculous for something that'll be washed so often. Anyway, it shrunk and doesn't fit over the co-sleeper mattress. If you have time/space to air dry it, it's probably a fine product. 
 Until now, I enjoyed John Maxwell's books, but this one is just one big yawn.  Same stuff you read in his other books, which are much better.  
 This book is just a compilation of some applications.  However there is no uniformity in the contents. The contents appear more like conference papers rather than book chapters 
 I 'upgraded' to this phone recently from a Treo 650 that had speaker and audio problems (don't all Treo 650's suffer from that within a year's usage?) and was already replaced once with a refurbished one that developed same problems. I loved my Treo 650 anyway so I expected something equivalent to the 650 but what I got was a 'smartphone' with quite a stupid battery life.  I have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design (some online geeks suggest it might actually be the SIM card) that is causing power to run right out of the phone, in a sharp decline, even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled. Add to this the fact that Palm's website's online user group is not active right now (so no users can visibly discuss this among themselves),and you don't have to think too long to conclude that Palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward, when they recently dumped this cheaper "smartphone" on the market recently.  Palm, all I can say is pretty "stupid" and wonder if this was your last hurrah before exiting the "smartphone" market?  
 Elmore Leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  He has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  What many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, Leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  As such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  However, 'Be Cool' is not one of his best.  The concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  And not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  Chili Palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  As always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  However, when reading 'Be Cool' I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  Many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  Also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  Leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  The reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  I'd always recommend Elmore Leonard as a quick, enjoyable, "beach" read.  However, go with something else of his instead of 'Be Cool. 
 DUDE?!?! What happened, when i heard about a new Zombie cd i was like O YEA! and then when i heard foxy foxy i was like WTF?? What happened to Hellbilly and Sinister kind of music?? I dont know what happened but, I'll admit theres a few decent songs like Let It All Bleed Out and The Scorpion Sleeps, but WTF?!?!?!?!?                                                 
 I purchased this product to replace a really good 802.11g unit from Linksys, hoping to set up a Gigabit home network with ethernet storage.  I initially considered the WRT300N model, but the reviews were mediocre.  So I went instead for this newer model, hoping that Linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the WRT300N model.  I am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the WRT300N also apply to this model.  I am returning it after 5 hours of use.  On my home network set up with my current Linksys 802.11g unit, I am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house, and all four movies display flawlessly.  On this new unit optimized for streaming video, I was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit.  The movie had interruptions every 4-5 seconds.  This was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit.  Performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with G cards and N cards.  And performance degraded as I tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time.  The speed of the links to my laptops equiped with N cards was 144 Mb/s, and was 54 Mb/s on those equiped with G cards.  So the connection seemed fast enough.  It might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way, it might be able to perform as I expect.  But I don't have time to waste on such tweaking, and given that my 802.11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box, there is no point to "upgrade" to this new flawed model.  I'll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out 
 I am a great fan of Mr. Thom's work. I typically scour the shelves for his books.  However I found this one below his usual standards.  I did not get the impression his research was as thorough this time. Towards the end, the  story dragged.  I found myself finishing the book merely to bring it to  closure. I still highly recommend Mr. Thom's other works to friends. But  this book will definitely not be on the by-name list 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 Yep.  I read what everyone said about how breakable  the crock and the lid are.  So I always used extreme caution when handling mine.  I got it for Christmas and broke off a side handle before Valentine's Day.   I didn't drop it or anything.  I just tapped the handle unexpectedly when moving the crock from one side to the other of my divided kitchen sink.     I had never considered owning a Crock-Pot before seeing this one.  The appearance and the idea that it would also be useful on stove top and oven was what sold me.  Oh well 
 This book merely skims the surface of DTS.  Enough details of DTS are not supplied.  For instance there are a number of annoyances with DTS that must be avoided using workaround that are mentioned nowhere in this book.  Also more complicated subjects of DTS are merely skimmed through.  This book is not good for beginner nor for professionals 
 This is a moderately well-spun book about the "No Spin Zone." Should be called the "Know Spin Zone" since really nothing in it is objective.  O'Reilly is a case-study in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this.  In other words it's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it.  If you can't see through O'Reilly's bias then this book is poison 
 expecting big sound and good FM station reception, buy something els 
 There is nothing good I can say about this coffee maker. It leaks and makes terrible tasting coffee. This is by no means a small leak...water goes all over the counter. The replacement unit I got leaked worse than the first. Don't waste your time or money on this product. Senseo makes a much better single serve coffee maker. 
 Easy to install.  We used it for less than a month and it no longer rotates- you can still hear the engine running, but no movement.  Hardly any use at all- maybe 10 times.  We tried taking it apart to see if something simple was wrong and the screws are set so tight you can't open it to see the inner workings. I have never received a bad item from amazon before- I am very disappointed with this product. 
 I saw this movie a while back only because the family of the girl I was dating at the time was watching it and therefore was forced to sit down and watch it too. To this day,I pray I don't ever have to sit through 2 hours of crap that trashes the reputations of the average mexican-american again. As a mexican-american who has worked hard to take the right road in life,I was disturbed at the storyline of this wannabee classic. Do we really need to come out with a movie for all of America to see that shows a negative side of the mexican race? Prison sex? Babies drinking beer? Young kids doing a drive by? Mexicans killing innocent blacks and vice versa? Please!!!! Wake up mexicans-americans! We need some positivity!!!!! Edward James Olmos said he made this movie because he wanted to send a message. What message? That doing the things shown in this movie are bad? I think we knew that already! What surprises me alot is all the positive reviews on Amazon that this movie got. This of course means that no matter how much sense I have made,it is more than likely that no one will find my review helpful. P.S....Let us not forget that I am not the only one who thinks negative about this film. Several consultants involved in this film were murdered by individual(s) out there who found the movie offensive. Edward James Olmos himself was the center of threats following the release of this movie. Adios amigos!!! 
 I made it about two-thirds of the way through before putting the book down. Not that the writing is vomitous; it isn't. But this book should have been marketed for young people, not adult readers. It's very basic and generic--at every turn I was thinking: "Jeez, each of these sentences would require you to read an entire book to get the background!" Now that's not a bad thing in a young person's book, as it could inspire the reader to check into the history further. But for an adult who already likes history and has read a fair amount of it, this is like a comic book version.  Another thing that bugged me was Cantor's relentlessly positive view of Gaunt and his times. OK, maybe Gaunt was a great guy, and maybe the Middle Ages weren't the pool of muck I've always thought they were, but knock off the Norman Vincent Peale act and give us a little more balance! (Which would equate to more interest, incidentally.)  Adults interested in knowing more about the 14th century would do much better with Barbara Tuchman's *A Distant Mirror* or Johan Huizinga's *The Waning of the Middle Ages* (which Cantor pooh-poohs, but is a much better read than Cantor's book!) 
 Only problem is, that it is only worth 19.00, which is the TRUE list price 
 I found the fourth book of this series a sad departure from what made the previous books great.  It moves the overall story line further, but its  a step i wish i could have skippe 
 Reading this book, I had already seen Revenge of the Sith as well as the Clone Wars Cartoon Network series that led up to Revenge of the Sith and I must say, to see a book come in and present its own version of the attack on Coruscant was disappointing.  While I'm sure there are enough fans out there who haven't watched the Clone Wars, there are probably more that have and it changed a lot of the storylines used for the last moments before the opening of Revenge of the Sith.  While I'm not saying the Clone Wars version of the attack on Coruscant is the only real version of the story, the book could have redeemed itself but explaining things that readers who had not seen the Clone Wars would be wondering.  For example, in Revenge of the Sith, the first time you see General Grievous, he is coughing and wheezing badly.  Without seeing the Clone Wars, you would not know why.  The book also gives no explanation as to why.  Finally, the political undertones that permeate this book are sickening.  This is supposed to be the Stars Wars universe not the current US Presidency/Congress plotlines set in the Star Wars universe.  All in all, as much of a fan of the Star Wars movies and books, this is by far my least favorite book I have read in the series and I will not be in any rush to read it again.  
 My husband and I were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born.  He has been using it up to now, and I used it this week for the first time.  Our daughter is 9 1/2 months and 21 pounds.  It was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone.  The problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain I have after just a two mile walk!!!  I can't wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk!!!  I would NEVER recommend that someone buys this! 
 The title suggests from scratch but as everyone has said so far, lotion recipes suggest you do additives to a lotion base. Nice recipes though. 
  This book is very, very poor... I think was purchased similar book of Ron Champions; Build a Sportscar for less than 250". The frame construction is not covered, others important aspects are not covered. Only a bad book 
 ...since writing this series in 1984.  Fresh from reading the Lions of Al-Rassan (pub. 1995), the Sarantine Mosaic (pub. 1998),  and the Last Light of the Sun (pub. 2004), with their subtle plots and characters, richly crafted world and religions, I thought that Kay could do nothing wrong.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  All the above qualities are glaringly absent here.  Instead of subtle characters, we have 5 heroes who constantly, and at length, reflect on their FEELINGS.  Yet, they manage to carry off all that tedious introspection without ever, well, coming to life.  The contrast with George RR Martin or later Kay POV passages could not be more marked.  For example, if I was a Toronto college student, suddenly lured on false premises into a deadly war, I would be quite a bit more upset and concerned about my safety than these guys.  Though maybe not quite as much as say, a Thomas Covenant (whose lengthy self-examinations, while repetitive, also make a lot more sense).  In later books, Kay will sometimes end a chapter with something like "And he suddenly realized what he had to do" and leave you reflecting on which possible decision the protagonist will choose, based on all the insight you have into his behavior and motivations.  In Fionavar, these cliffhangers happen much more frequently.  Likely as not, the protagonist will then, for no reason at all, based on no information known to the reader, run off to a location not yet introduced, to do something earthshaking entirely out of the blue.  Perhaps the characters behave that way because they are destined to do so.  The role of fate, personified by the Tapestry, becomes more pronounced in the concluding book of the trilogy.  Yet, that is a subtle point and hardly justifies the inane storywriting throughout.  Fionavar itself has a cliche good-vs-evil backstory, "inspired" by Tolkien and Celtic legends.  Geographically, characters zoom off from one end to the other in hours, by teleportation if necessary, to further the "plot".   The result is that you it feels more like an adventure around a big city/theme park and its surroundings than a real world, with real features and real people.    The religious aspect involves various gods frequently interacting with mortals and Rakoth Maugrim, the bad guy, makes Sauron look like an in depth character study.  Everything comes off as archetypical, rather than realistic.  That might have been the intent, but did not make this series any more pleasurable for me.  I really can't say that Kay should be ashamed of it, because he has since matured into one of Fantasy's best writers.  But Fiorana was not a promising start by any means.  And no, books 2 and 3 aren't all that much better either 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Card's writing, especially his, uh, "Enderverse".  I loved Ender's Game, I absolutely adored Speaker for the Dead, I'm reading Xenocide and I love what I've read, and I liked Ender's Shadow.  I don't like Shadow of the Hegemon though.  It's nothing but boring, long and tedious talk about...politics.  Also, Card doesn't seem to understand how much the world would have changed in 200 years.  I don't know, I seem to like Card better when he's writing about philosophy, not politics 
 Reason To Believe has got to be the worst movie I have ever sat through. Non of the characters are at all believable and most are morally disgusting. I am no prude but if this movie represents the way college students live today then it is no wonder the world is in such decay. There really is no reason to see this movie. Totally disgusting. Why well known actors would be involved in such sleazy trash is beyond comprehension!!! 
 This is a very difficult and outdated book. Even my drum instructor thinks it is too difficult. There are many other more modern books out there that will accomplish the same thing. I think the only classics of the "old school books" are Funky Primer, stick control, and syncopation. 
 This was my first Patterson book, and while I may still try some of his other works, this one was not interesting or gripping in my opinion.  The character development was weak.  The novel is full of twists in the plot, and has a few good moments, but the people seem too simple to really grab my attention.  If you have not read this author before, I would try a different book first.  I have heard that some of his other books are quite different from the books in this series. 
 Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story 
 This book might be helpful as a starting point for someone who knows nothing about lymphedema. It read like a tired retread of the information the American Cancer Society dispenses for free. Since I experience a direct  correlation between protein intake and arm swelling, I was hoping the  authors would go into far greater diet detail than their short chapter on  nutritional supplements. Save your money -- there is nothing new here 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading 
 I wish when I was young someone had sat me down and explained explained some of the life stages I would go through as a teen, young adult, young married person, young father, and a young "provider."  The good thing about this book is that it gives some clues about the stages people typically go through from about 55 onward.  Since I'm 49 I appreciate the clues about what is coming.  The bad thing about this book is that it only touches the surface of the subject it addresses, and the writer is not extremely gifted at conveying his material.  Nevertheless, the writer performs a valuable service and I'm sure he does the best he can 
 I bought a dog-eared copy of this collection ("Trouble is My Business") at a book sale for $1.50 a year ago.  The copy I have is thick with 12 stories.  I bought this copy of "Trouble is my Business" to have a better copy, but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four Marlowe stories.  My question is, what the hell happened to the first 8 and why is Amazon.com still describing this as a collection of 12 when there are merely four?  That's not jake, fellas 
 When I got ordered these shoes, I was so excited because the picture looked so nice. Do not be deceived by its looks. I saw it in another store, and I tried it on for fun. The shoe fits poorly, and its actually really ugly. I would definitely not reccomend it to any one 
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 this book is okay for a beginners intro to iran but it misconstrues completely some of the facts of iranian history.  mossdaegh did NOT assume dicatatorial powers, and at times it seems that ms mackey feels sympathy for the shah.  the crimes of SAVAK, the shah's secret police, arent well documented either.  dont waste your money- I recommend THE LAST GREAT REVOLUTION by Robin wright or PERSIAN MIRRORS by Elaine Sciolin 
 Herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the Nazification of both Germanies: did they side with Israel in the Middle East version of the Cold War or did they not? The trial against Paul Merker in the East, which had as its background East Germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated Jews, serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things Nazi in the GDR. But both of these arguments completely ignore the Marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the East German leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. Moreover, they totally eclipse the East German cultural discourse on the Holocaust, a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the West and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in Western academia. 
 Our family has greatly enjoyed the Scholastic Children's Dictionary, so it made sense to also get the Scholastic Children's Thesaurus.  What a disappointment!  Nearly every word my fourth grader looks up (for school work) is not in this book. It is pretty much useless for her school work.  Don't bother with it 
 I bought this book for my Pre-K class, to go along with our weather unit on Rain. The cover looked so nice I thought it would be a great book. In fact, the illustrations are quite nice; the problem is there's really no story here. The language doesn't flow; its very choppy. The children didn't enjoy this book, and have not asked for it to be read again. Good children's literature should have a story to it: a setting, problem and solution; a definite beginning, middle and ending; and well-defined characters. This book has none of that 
 This book stinks, the plot is trivial, the characters suck, and the chapters go on and on and on and on and on about nothing, nothing at all.   Here is my favorite passage from the book "There was nothing for him to do but roll over and try to sleep.  Somewhere, sometime, he had even forgotten how to cry."  Yeah the entire book is like that.   
 I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!).  There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same).  And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece.  Every one!  It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.  The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.  I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere.  I seriously do not recommend these to anyone 
 Very disapointing for me as a beginner "real estate investor" - I also happen to be a professional salesperson and recognize this book's cheap motivational patter from over 20+ sales seminars I've endured over the years. I made it through 20 pages before I found myself skimming and looking for 'information' rather than bogus dialog between fictional characters who all have a slight aversion to making cold calls, and need the authors to guide them to 'success'.  I will say that if you're looking for an abridged summary of the author's mentorship program than this book is for you... written in a 3rd person style which is ridiculously overflattering, for those who may possibly want to get into a numbers game of banging the phone for 'deals' using the authors homebrew 'schtick'...and a tip to the average reader, unless you're a uniquely cheesy saleperson my guess is their 'schtick' isn't going to work you.  Having said all this, as a salesguy I have to give them kudos for being successful businesspeople - but I'm guessing their success isn't due to real estate...I bought their book after all, and I'm sure many others have too.   So...my recommendation, for anyone interested in knowing "who you need to know" and "what you need to look for" and "what types of questions to ask a seller" and "how to calculate return on investment i.e. cash-on-cash" I strongly suggest the "Rich Dad's Advisors: The ABC's of Real Estate Investing : The Secrets of Finding Hidden Profits Most Investors Miss (Rich Dad's Advisors) by Ken McElroy"... now that's a book with some facts and guidelines... How you get yourself motivated is your own business, this guy tells it like it is and lets you go to work.  Of course everyone has an opinion, and this is just my 2 cents - I can only hope it saves you the trouble of reading this book! 
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 And I thought I WAS a die-hard Conrad fan!  He's one of those writers by whom I must read a book every two or three years -- but this one I did not like at all.  Despite the usual brilliant prose, much of it as good as  anything Conrad has done, "Tether" is a let-down -- astoundingly  depressing!  Most Conrad work posits a world that is inimical and uncaring,  yet holds out hope that courage and integrity will serve to help us endure  it all; "Tether" holds out no such hope.  It concerns a captain  who continues to pilot his ship even though he is legally blind, doing so  in order to provide for his family.  Nothing turns out okay, and no one  ends up happy.  I don't ask for a lot of hope from the books I read -- but  at least a little 
 Though the illustrations are cute and the content is fine, these othersized and lightweight flaps rip VERY easily.  We've not even had them 1 month and the book is in poor condition from regular use that other flap books do fine. Cannot recommend this one! We are very disappointed 
 this movie suffers from being moronically and mind numbingly pathetic and stupid. Jerry O'Connell (tv's Sliders, tv's Crossing Jordan), Ryan Reynolds (The In-LAws, tv's Two Guys a Girl and A Pizza Place) and Bill Bellamy (Love Stinks, Tv's Fastlane) are friends. O'Connell has a graphic design company and has a lovely girlfriend, Bridgette Wilson (House On Haunted Hill, Love Stinks) but work gets in the way, which force the both of them to experiment in dating others. Reynolds tries to cope with the fact that he is becoming gay. It's, its just an awful movie and it really suffers from mad cow diesease, litterally. Reynolds shouldnt of done that scene from Silence OF The Lambs, NO! that was wrong! Ron Livingston (Office Space, Swingers) shouldnt of been in this movie and he just looks too much like Jon Tenney's (HomeGrown, Fools Rush In) older brother. Alyssa Milano (Poison IVy 2, FeaR) has bad choices in movies now. Also starring Kevin Weisman (tv's Alias, tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Annabeth Gish (tv's X-Files, SLC Punk), Fiona Loewi (senior Trip, Love and Death On Long Island) and a weird appearace by John O'Hurley (best known for portraying Elaine Bennetts boss on Seinfeld), you know the guy, "my buddies call me Timbo" , it was just too much and it is a forgettable movie. Steer clear from this junk. The title song in the beginning Jerry O'Connell sang in Scream 2. 
 This is an addendum to my review of two years ago.    First off, I mentioned that the book is written on a grade-school level.  Why not produce another edition, with the title "The Depression Workbook for Smart People" or "The Depression Workbook for the College-Educated"?  This may help some of us to feel less put off and alienated.  Additionally, the book is also written from a highly feminine point of view.  The profession expresses concern that more men are not coming forward and seeking help for depression, but I believe many men are not comfortable with many of the suggestions put forward in this book (and many others).  Men are not inclined to take up painting, or knitting, or flower arranging.  We like skeet shooting, NASCAR, and cage fighting. In other words, expecting men to become more like women in order to get well is unreaslistic.  Another suggested edition: "The Depression Workbook for Men." 
 The book has nothing special to offer. Its a quick and mindless read. I could not identify with the characters at all. The two female protagonists are way too silly and naive, given their respective ages. The male protagonist is unappealing from the beginning. The book left me feeling devoid of any new or fresh perspective. In brief, if your stuck in a coffee house and need to pass time without thinking too much, you can perhaps grab a copy 
 	If you like Dee Henderson's book Danger in the Shadows, you will like the book The Negotiator. In the book Dave from Danger in the Shadows meets the O'Malley, a group of orphans or abandoned kids who adopted themselves into a family of seven, and begins a friendship with them. The first O'Malley that he meets is Kate; she is a negotiator who walks into any situation to make sure all of the hostages get out alive. She just so happens that she gets called out to negotiate at the same bank that Dave is getting held at. Between the two of them all of the hostages get out a live and they hit off a good friendship.  	Then Kate starts to become a target, first to a stalker that just got out of jail and then to a bomber that blew up a plane with 214 people on it just after he told her he not to forget the past. Dave, an FBI agent, is the assigned to be Kate's watcher. When Kate's family gets to the wreck, they are as mad as she is and tell her that she is staying with Dave because his house was used as a Safe House for his sister when she was staying away from her kidnapper. Then on top of all of this, the suspect is her brother that was born one year after she was taken away from her parents and the youngest of the O'Malley's has cancer. This is a book of a group of adults who have been hardened by their past trying to find god's mercy and power in a time of despair. 	I liked almost everything part of this book because it was a mix of books that I like. The only part that I didn't like about it was that is some places it was dragged on a bit too long.  	I would recremend this book to any body who likes novels of suspense and people over coming odds and ending up at the top.     
    The subject matter being an intrnet porn star's life. It is not a movie, it is cheap explotation.  This piec of trash looks like it was shot using a cheap ditiga camera, and  lousy editing skills. (That's all the internet is good for is porn web-sites).   Not surpriseingly, it was never given a theater release, I think even if the MPAA had rated it, it would have been NC-17.  How about rated T for TRASH 
 I have read this book more than halfway now and have seen MANY inaccuracies in it.  People who think this book is informative are so uninformed.  There is so much proof of what did and didn't happen on 9-11 there should be no question now and this book does not have the facts 
 ordered size XXL for my brother for christmas, he said it fit great overall but it was too short! he's 6'5" and ussually an XXL sweatshirt fits just fine all over, including length. He loved the sweatshirt, so was disappointed that he had to return it 
 If you want to have a less fantasized and a more detailed biography of Ataturk, you should read Patrick Kinross or Andrew Mango. This book is close to fiction than to history. Some parts are exagerated to create a tension and a push to read the text. Moreover the narrative usually does not give any clue why he moved in a certain way. During the book the plot is more important than the information. If you are distant to the history of Ottoman Empire or Turkey, you may easily adopt an unrealistic view 
 Rarely is pretentious drivel so profoundly trite.  Perfectly exemplifies the great post-modern con.  A chaotic assemblage of random terms to which meaning is later ascribed, so much like a certain nostradomus.  There are two principle types of literay work:  1. That which is to be read. and of course  2. That which is to be carted about, the title clearly visible, with a look of supreme smugness upon the owner's face.  Gravity's Rainbow is quite obviously a work of the latter category.  You see, I've come to the think of myself as something of an amateur post-modern poet; here is an example of my work:  Ball, Kite, wolf, sky, space, heart, moon, expand, window, flowing, profound, pompous, gravity's rainbow.  You see i'm quite the literary genius, somebody give me an award!!!  What you fools fail to realize is that the post-modern style is simply a tool enabling those of simple mind to veil their lack of true artistry behind absurdity 
 I bought this drive a little over one year ago and with 2 years warranty. Around 8 months period, the system cannot boot from the drive and the test software provided by WD also proved it's dead. So I mailed it back for a replacement, and (surprisingly) I got back a re-certified one with only 3 months warranty. Literally, my warranty plan was cut to 1 year. I didn't bother to call them to get a new replacement. Unfortunately, another 2 months after the warranty expires (from the re-cerified one), the disk went dead again.   I would not recommend this model to anyone, since within 1 year, 2 went bad. Also, I don't like the way they handle the replacement within warranty period. 
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 This book teaches people the unethical way to advertise on the internet - spamming.  Following these methods, at worse, will put you in legal trouble. At best, you will be making money unethically and making lots of people angry.  These stupid get rich quick internet schemes don't work anyways... don't waste your time or money 
 I bought it expecting a "history"  book.  Instead,  I got a compilation of anecdotes and generalizations  told in chronological order.   I consider this book  to be a  polemic on women's issues,  an angry feminist history,  rather than any kind of scholarly or even exploratory work in history.  Needless to say,  I was  disappointed.  Historians today are looking at how women have been able to contribute to their respective societies  even in oppressive conditions.  The author is still male bashing and playing sexual politics.  (Miles is primarily a writer of popular feminist historical novels.)   Yes,  there was a tidbit or two that was new,  (the first and second chapters were pretty good)   but when I checked the notes  there were precious few primary sources or even secondary source histories;  women's studies and sociology texts constituted the bulk of resource materials.   Even the bibliography is skewed toward the "women's studies" department rather than history and there were certainly far more works mentioned than apparently used.  No wonder the title was changed -  it's not a history book.   And it certainly is popular with women's studies classes.   Perhaps the "old" title (which was changed for good reason) indicated that this is a "women's history,"  in the sense that it's told from a woman's perspective - not an historian's.   I  appreciate that the history of women needs more examination and that it cannot be done in the same "just the facts, ma'am" manner of the old political, economic and  military histories.   I  appreciate that it's books like Miles'  ("history from  below"  with somewhat more emphasis on generalizations than the pre-revisionists would like)  which contribute to historiography of women's history in that they can give creative direction to historians.  But  with this book,  women are just continuing to receive the same appalling treatment that has so often been their plight.  Women's history is being given short shrift indeed, and women  deserve more attention,  more respect and more validity.   This book doesn't change a thing 
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 There were multiple recordings of some of the same songs on this ablum. I can see doing maybe one song, two different ways. However, there was one song done three different ways and another song done twice which almost sounded the same 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 I found this title on a list of recommended academic satire, and the premise sounded too promising to pass up.  In similar books I've read recently (Moo, Straight Man, Small World), the level of writing skill is deliciously high - perhaps because the authors themselves teach the craft.   The influence of HP Lovecraft on the author is obvious, even before he drops a reference to Miskatonic University.  The plots and execution of the tales, however, are disappointingly and distractingly clumsy, compared to those of Lovecraft and other writers of academe.    All three stories are told from the third person in roughly the same voice, they are predictable, and there are strange inconsistencies that an editor should have caught.  In the first story there is a "teaching assistant" who is later referred to as a "postdoc."  Which is he?  Overall, I'd have to recommend giving this book a pass, unless you are tolerant of thin plots, clumsy foreshadowing, and cardboard characters.  Go re-read The Dunwich Horror, instead 
 Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
 I agree with the other reviewers in the sense that it is ture Gallian's book is soft on theory and rigor, but oppositely I find this lack of real substance to be Gallian's deepest flaw. I give Gallian one star, basically for effort.    I divide my critique into the following subcategories:  Organization:  Gallian's book is organized well enough in the sense that he opens each chapter with some commentary about the problems to be studied, or motivation, and then proceeds to go example, theorem, proof, example, example, example, example,..., example. This doesn't work, I think, because he spends too little time actually showing theorems and proofs, and sometimes he'll build an entire chapter on just two or three theorems, and fill the rest with useless commentary (which I'll mention again below).  Readability:  As for readability, for people who read math books at all (i.e., those who study outside of class), this book should be a nightmare. If you were to strip away all of the useless commentary/endless biographical insets/weblinks you would be left with probably about 30 pages of theorems and cumbersome proofs (by cumbersome, I don't mean involved, I mean unrefined). Gallian has failed to make a readable text because he presumes to have the omnipotence and foresight required for putting a full understanding of algebra and algebra history into one book. As a result, the excess commentary he makes and useless statements (for example, "In high school, students study polynomials with integrer, rational, real, and sometimes complex coefficients") distract a reader from the main points, and I rarely found myself rubbing my chin thinking how insightful something he said was. All in all, I feel as though the reading felt "hoakie" at best--like he was elbowing me in the side, winking, trying to get me to lie and say I thought what he was saying was insightful.   Exercises:  The exercises are often clumsily put together and the quotes before each problem set can get extremely patronizing. I remember thinking how cocky this Gallian fellow must be to presume that people can't do "his" problems. A joke, to say the least. In any case, they seem fine for all purposes -- if you're going into chemistry or an applied science that uses group theory. It's very obvious that our author believes that group theory is the pinnacle of the algebra experience and struggles to present topics from rings and fields. IF you are someone who likes group theory, fine. BUT Artin's book does everything Gallian does and more with group theory and builds the same ideas on more solid footing, using linear algebra excessively throuhout the book. For example, if you think I'm joking about Gallian's weakness, just look at the chapters on isometries and compare them to the chapters in Artin, and you'll see what I'm talking about.   Peter Rabbit:  Well, I do have at least one nice thing to say. As anyone can see, Gallian has a lot of examples, but this seems to be the only redeeming quality of the book. But that alone doesn't make an algebra book.   Broad Commentary:  If it's a softer touch you're looking for, I'd say go with Durbin -- he's easy to follow and an excellent writer. If it's group theory, examples, and a lot of wonderful exercises you want, go with Artin. Neither of those books get caught up in useless commentary. I've heard good and bad things about Fraleigh (sp?), but have no direct experience with that book. I would suggest, for those who don't want a hardcore book such as Herstein's Topics in Algebra, or M. Artin's Algebra, you should see Durbin's book. Durbin is also a softer book; it has many nice examples and is very well written. IF you are unavoidably made to use this book for a course, and if you want to learn to be more insightful/challange yourself to think/want to study, then I suggest you use any of Artin, Herstein, or Durbin as a companion (in that order, but I only place Artin above Herstein because Artin has more material in it, Herstein is a much better writer so you might choose him depending on which book you'll spend more time with).  * EDIT * Several years later, I can say that EVERY student I have known personally who used this as the primary book for an undergraduate course and later took graduate algebra courses ended up having much trouble with graduate algebra courses or quitting them completely. 
 I really looked forward to reading this book because I liked all of the books by Daniel Hecht that I have read. City Masks was very good and I thought Land of Echoes was great. I tried so hard to finish this book but I was fighting boredom and finally gave up 
 more hate books.  How could anyone write anything so wrong 
 Of all the Organic Chemistry text books I have reviewed, this one is at the bottom of the pile.  It is not logically presented and figures are confusing.  For an excellent undergraduate (200 or 300 level class) try  Brown and Foote 
 While this unit may be as accurate as described, I nonetheless had to return it because it was an extremely uncomfortable, annoyingly intrusive fit on my wrist. 
 Since you can tell how I feel about this book based on the title of my review, I won't repeat everything that's been said by the other reviewers so far.  However, I will say that, as a small business owner who tries very hard to spend money wisely, I am SO NOT HAPPY that I spent close to $20 for this book that is of absolutely no value to me.  I don't want to throw it away, but I certainly can't see where anybody would want to buy it if I re-sold it. This book was a total waste of money--if there were a 0-star rating, I'd give it that without hesitation 
 This was the first backcountry cookbook I bought. I was looking for recipes that could be mostly assembled at home, would be lightweight to transport, and were easy to cook over a backpacking stove.  On first glance, this book appeared to fit the bill. Most recipes are assembled at home, dehydrated, and then rehydrated as a one-pot meal. However, I tried several recipes this past summer while canoeing and camping in the BWCAW and found the texture and taste of most of the meals to be disappointing. Many of the same ingredients are used over and over in "different" recipes, so many meals taste the same. Also, since the recipes are twice-cooked, the texture is often mushy.  Shortly after purchasing this book, I also bought Lipsmackin' Backpackin'. I ended up using this book for almost all of our camping meals, supplemented by hummus and candied walnuts, and a few other random recipes from Backpack Gourmet. I don't think that the purchase of Backpack Gourmet was offset by the few recipes that we regularly use.  I would recommend buying a different backcountry cookbook if you are intersted in eating something with flavor and texture. If, however, you aren't interested in flavor, but are simply looking for a meal that can be made quickly at camp and has all the calories and nutrients you need, then this is probably the book for you. 
 That anyone would mistake Greer's pseudo-philosophical rants for either an intelligent or thorough treatment of the subject is a testament to the pitiable state of Christian scholarship on the supposed "postmodern" turn in modern culture. Greer oversimplifies and misconstrues every complex philosophical term he touches, reading Derrida's "play of the trace" as a synonym for nihilism and spends a chapter "refuting" his views without ever providing evidence of having read (much less understood) him (no citations of Derrida's works are given).  If you are looking for a shallow, irresponsible treatment of the postmodern condition that restates evangelical fundamentalism with big fancy words, Mapping Postmodernism should be right up your alley. Those looking for an intelligent treatment of the subject, however, would be wise to find another map 
 The content is likely written by an expert, but provided commentary on only selected portions of the biblical Psalms book. This was admitted to as well by the author - but one must read within the book to see this revealed. For the reason that it did not encompass the entirety of Psalm, the book was a disappointment to me. 
 Call me a glutton for punishment, but I read many of the I-Hate-The-Clintons trash that is published and is trotted out as serious reading.  (you would think that books like this one are written with crayon)   I do it to try to understand why a President who was responsible for giving this nation the longest sustained period of PEACETIME ECONOMIC EXPANSION, who headed a shrinking government, who reduced waste and left office with a balanced budget and a surplus as well, makes right-wingers HATE him so much.  Was it that he had the temerity to beat george h w bush, for the job of president?  Or, was it that republicans simply hate to see the American Dream realized?    IF you can read aldrich's book, and if you don't feel the need to be cleansed by holy fire in order to feel clean once more, then this is your kind of hate-book.    However, if you do have a soul and you don't want to sift through more lies than a fox news broadcast, try a book by Joe Conason, at least you'll be assured of truth and some A+ writing.    This aldrich fella should stick to writing traffic tickets and lying to traffic court judges....  Yes your honor, she was going 30 in the 20 mph zone......... very good mr aldrich, very good! 
 This is an example of what happens when a writer gets too famous for an editor to touch him. It's repetitive, with too many coincidences, too little explanation, which would have been difficult to do, so, better left out, I guess. Every time they are starving, they find a store of food. The woman conveniently dead because McCarthy doesn't like to write about women. He writes convincingly of the relationship between father and son, but if the landscape is as completely dead as he makes it out to be, there is no explanation of how they survived this long -- must be seven or eight years, minimum, on what? Leftover canned goods somehow overlooked by other starving people? Like a previous reviewer, I also wondered what the people in the cellar were eating.  Also, the one good person appears at the exact right time, or perhaps a day late or too late, but in time for a rescue. Too many haircuts, perhaps the author lost track, but starving people do not need to have their hair cut twice in 100 pages. And he indicates they had been on the road over a year, again without explaining how they managed that. It wasn't hard to read, but it just wasn't that skillfully done. It has a fairytale quality that I found frustrating--poof, that's how it was.  I need details.  The whole point is to construct a believable world, even if devastated, not just to write whatever you feel like writing and let the reader try to patch in the rest. Nice to be famous enough to get away with it, though. 
 The content of this book should have been the informercial for this book.  Although I understand the need for self promotion.....this book goes way overboard. Everything has been said before and at the end you feel like this book was geared for these two mens' fans and not people who are really looking for ways and means to get out of the rat race.  Hey Robert! We know about your other books and your game.  Donald, we know about your show.  Its great that those things made you rich but we want books with less fluff and less talk about your crap!!!! Honestly, if you havent been living under a rock for the last ten years, this book is a BIG waste of time and money!! 
 I bought this from Motherhood and hated it!!! It is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones, which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and don't need more help!! The mother ez belt was fabulous though!! I wore it for the last 4 months!!!  Forget about this one though!!! 
 Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?  Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.  Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.  But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
 I was looking forward to reading this book on what I thought would be a keen insider's look at the Cuban missile crisis, and was somewhat disappointed.  I realize that RFK was not able to complete the text, and perhaps that is reflected in it's length (100 pages of narrative).  A large part of the printed material, about 1/3, is made up of supporting documents.  I had hoped for more detail about the minute-to-minute events of those 13 days.  The strength of the book is its undeniably interesting topic and author.  There was insight to the crisis that I had not previously known, and reading it here was interesting and informative.  For a mid-1900's buff, this might be one piece of a collection and its uniqueness may prove worthwhile.  This is the first book I read on the Cuban missile crisis, and I am left wanting a lot more 
 I wish I could give it 0 stars.  Davis writes more about himself than the blues.  The pronoun "I" is his favorite word.  BORING. P.S. Only one mention of Johnny Winter... 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 I've had this book through 4 cats and kittens, and if you have a really healthy cat who never develops any illnesses, it's great. I find myself using the Cornell Feline Health Center online for my cats.   The diagnostic tree is just too vague, the descriptions of diseases are also too vague and there's just not enough information. Using a vet's resource center with a dictionary handy does you--and your cat--more good, especially if your cat has something really serious.   
 I have to admit I was disappointed in this book.  I ordered it because I knew the author, Harvey C. Parker was involved in CHADD, a support group for parents of children with ADD.  This book does a good job covering the basics, but if you are already an educated parent about ADD and strategies, it offers nothing new or advanced.  I'd say this book might be helpful for a parent who has a child aged 4-6, and who knows very little about ADD.  The sticker charts in the book are definitely geared toward younger children.  One example:  there is a "Good Bedtime Behavior" chart with a picture of a bed with a teddy bear on it.  There are ten circles on the headboard/footboard of the bed to put stickers on for behaving at bedtime.  Definitely not for my ten year old boy 
 Having read both the Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog, I thought that nothing written by Connie Willis could go wrong.  Unfortunatly, this book shows that perfection is not a constant.  I don't  know how this got through (maybe the publishers were eager for another  Connie Willis book to sell), but this book for me was uninspiring,  pointless, and confusing.  Although the interaction of the characters were  humorous at certain time, for the most part, I was left wondering if  anything was really happening.  Another problem I had (and maybe i'm just  too dense) was the fact that none of the characters were introduced.  I was  halfway though the book before I realized that Fin was female.  Unless if  there was a prequel that explained it all, anyone could be left wondering  if a name belonged to a person, place, or a thing. All in all, this book is  a disspointment from someone who has won Hugos and Nebulas for her works,  but then nobody should expect perfection all the time and should be  grateful for the other books Ms Willis has written. : 
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 I have used Intuit products since 1992, and was quite satisfied until 4 years ago when Intuit began installing hidden software on users' computers in an attempt to "stop piracy", which caused numerous problems for us honest users who paid for the program.  Secondly and even more significantly, I began noticing an apparent shift in Intuit's philosophy toward it's customers: cut back on customer support, and attempt to exploit them at every possible opportunity in order to make more money. In short, Intuit disrespects their customers. As a loyal paying customer, I will not be disrespected or taken for granted. Their level of service and support has declined. Their products constantly pimp you to spend more money on Intuit as you try to use their programs. That is why I have sworn off Intuit products when there is an alternative.  Why reward someone who treats you badly? 
 Having been a Setzer fan since his days with the Stray Cats, I eagerly awaited the release of this cd, hoping to find our Rockabilly Hero returning to his roots.  I was thoroughly disappointed by what we were given.  Setzer seems to lack the feel and love for this style that were so evident during his days with the Cats.  There are no stand-out tracks, and rather than real Rockabilly, we're given more a honky-tonk sounding selection of songs.  Final analysis:  Setzer should bury the hatchet with his former Stray Cats sidemen, Slim Jim Phantom and Lee Rocker and give fans an album of Real 50's Rockabilly, the likes of which we haven't seen since the Stray Cats 1989 release, Blast Off 
 As one reads the various customer reviews, it becomes obvious that the commentary in this book is skewed sharply to the right. Conservatives think it's "fair and balanced"; liberals don't. That's a tell tale sign as far as 24 TV news networks are concerned.  I have bought every edition since I turned 18 in 1978, but have decided not to purchase the next release after the 2006 election cycle. The hard factual information is accurate and well-presented. But the partisan slant compromises the book's credibility as an analytical product. With so much tendentious material, how can anyone not desirous of receiving the Fox News party line have  confidence in the soundness of the commentary--the "soft" factual information? Michael Barone made an excellent and original contribution to political political research when he introduced the Almanac back in the '70's. He now generates a product that's "in your face" if you're moderate or liberal. If you like George Bush, you'll love this book 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I was expecting a lot more from these two CD's. It teaches you a few items of food, basic words like "Hello", Please" and "airplane" and even teaches you to ask "Where are the suitcases"... but then that is about it. I was really hoping for more... much more 
 Reading this book reminded me of how you sometimes watch a bad movie just to see how bad it can get.  I did a lot skimming (fast forwarding) to see if it was consistent right up to the end.  It was.  Don't waste your time.  This was my first Iles book and will surely be my last 
 I purchased this game pad due to good reviews. Found it online for $15 with free shipping so had to try myself. Its true its built well and pretty comfortable in the hand. The programming software is alright as well, not as nice as the Nostromo n50/52 software for example.  But what i didnt like about it was much more relavant. Firstly there is a toggle lock shift button. This button is easy to press by accident and since it is not a momentary button you have to go back and press it off agian. Interupting game play.  Also buttons 7 and 8 are not paddles but rather thumb, and quite far from normal thumb use. I had a hard time using those buttons quickly.  Also the toggle and digital buttons cant be mapped for other uses so your limited to 8 total buttons rather than 10.  And finally, for some reason there was no way to invoke fight in NHL06, i couldnt live with that so i had to ship it back, and ill soon go with the logitech 
 Weekend Buzz is the only track worth listening too and you're better off saving your money if you didn't like the Harmony's Bhudda Luvaz 
 I am surprised by all the good reviews this book has received.  To start with, this book is mainly about a woman who says 1) she isn't very good at housework and 2) just plain doesn't want to do it, so she hires it out. Now, mind you, there is *nothing* wrong with that attitude, people hire out tasks all the time for those very reasons.   However, throughout the book, she makes derogatory assumptions such as:  Housekeeping is a no skills/low skills job People who choose to be housekeepers aren't very smart Children can't be trained to take over housekeeping tasks  And so on--too many to list here, and then in other parts of the book she goes and contradicts some of her previous statements.  Her arguments for hiring a housekeeper are of the whiny, I-shouldn't-have-to-do-this-demeaning-work type, and she brings up the tired, "traditional" man vs. woman arguments, as well as "we're all too busy". Do men and women argue over housework? Of course, but these days usually the arguments are neatnik vs. slob, not about who's doing (or not doing) the dishes. Are people busier than they used to be? Maybe, but that is a choice you make, not something forced on you.   Children need some chores to teach them life skills for when they leave home--the few chores she leaves for children in her book are a joke. If you're willing to take the time to train a new housekeeper, why not spend that quality time training your children instead? Not to mention that, if you're truly willing to pay for housekeeping, why not pay family first?  She has a cost justification worksheet, where for example she states that you save money by having your housekeeper prepare your meals. Well, no, you're shifting the costs from buying convenience foods and/or eating out to paying your new employee. And, by the way, her website where she says there are forms to use does not work.  In one way, this book was unintentionally funny--in the back she has a list of references. In it, she lists books such as The Sidetracked Sisters Catch Up On the Kitchen.  If she'd taken time to actually *read* the book, and their first book, Sidetracked Home Executives, she would have learned that it would not be necessary to hire a housekeeper. Once you go to all the trouble to clean up for the housekeeper and get a system in place (which Sherman insists on, by the way, so that a housekeeper will *want* to work for you), the little that is left to do could easily be accomplished by her children, her, and her husband. For example, one of the DAILY tasks for her housekeeper is to vacuum the entry, living room, etc. Well, if you have a "no shoes" policy, you could vacuum once a week, or even every other week.    After reading this book, I still was not convinced that hiring out your housekeeping would allow you to increase your income, or even save you money, although it might make you feel better.   Now, on the other hand, a housekeeper would be quite helpful, say if you have several children under 5 at home, or are looking into one for an elderly parent, you're recovering from surgery, etc., and for someone in these situations, this book would be helpful for overcoming objections to hiring one.  But for the vast majority of people, let's be honest, hiring out housekeeping is a *luxury*, not a necessity.   The book has a few useful food recipes, some tips on getting your point across, and a sample housekeeper schedule that you might find useful. Borrow from your library first, before buying.   I also suggest that people read "Your Money or Your Life" along with this book to get some perspective. Would you rather do a little housework here and there on your terms and timetable, or work at a job that not only costs you money to go to, but puts restrictions on how you spend your time and creates extra stress in your life so that you can hire a housekeeper 
 Coffeemaker just quit yesterday makes cold coffee now unable too use. got a three year warranty and lasted three months. Biggest waste of money yet. Now call customer service get a busy signal last 15 minutes. never buy another hamilton beach product. 
 I was expecting a lot from this book, and I certainly walked away feeling disappointed.  Jayna Davis comes off as something of a literal Michael Moore for the right here.  I say that because much like Moore used his film to ambiguously blame the 9/11 attacks on Saudi Arabia, Ms. Davis seems to be insinuating that Saddam Hussein was responsible for this attack.    First, yes, there is much more to this story than has been told to us.  John Doe number 2 is a legit question and the evidence does seem to indicate that he may have been a former Iraqi who was brought over to America by the first President Bush (along with many others).  But that does not mean that he, or anyone involved in the bombing, was funded or linked to Saddam (or Al Qaeda).    A things to take into consideration: I've read a few of the previous reviews that seem to indicate that because there are endorsements from former CIA director R. James Woolsey and Reagan DOD official Frank Gaffney, this makes the book completely legit.  Not quite.  Woolsey and Gaffney have become two of the loudest underground neoconservative voices of the last few years.  Woolsey also endorsed "A Study of Revenge" which pins the first WTC bombing on Hussein.  Clearly, he's more interested in justifying the war started by his peers than helping the American people find the truth.   Further, since these are two people who have the ears of the White House (especially the VP), why wouldn't this have been used to justify the second Gulf War if the evidence is so strong linking Saddam to this attack??  It certainly would have helped make the case, and given the American people a solid reason for taking the man out.  Considering that this adminstration has no problem playing fast and loose with the facts, I would imagine they would have run with this premise, even if they have minor doubts.    Personally, I don't believe Saddam had the ability to pull something like this off.  Throughout the 90's he was heavily contained and monitored.  I can't see him pulling off an attack like this (or the first WTC).    Still, this book raises some important questions that remain unanswered to this day.  And those questions should continue to be asked, just as many questions about 9/11 persist.  But raving endorsements from Glenn Beck, Woolsey and Gaffney actually hurt the credibility of this book rather than help it. 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 Pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought; he mistakes child abuse for some form of "real" child rearing.  I just read his interview in the Guardian UK.   Although it has been years since I have read this book, it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when I think about it.  I have read philosophy from classic to contemporary; I have lived in Japan and practiced Zen archery and Zen meditation - this book has only incorrect views of Western AND Eastern philosophy yet Pirgsig, to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon. This is proof that Pirsig remains deranged.  Moreover, in the Guardian UK interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered; Pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son's murder. Pirsig is a perfect example of someone with Narcisstic Personality Disorder.  Pirsig's son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and/or capitulating mother.   If you are one of the poor souls who finds something "deep" in this very large pile of verbal manure then I think therapy would be money well spent 
 An awful yawner.  It shows all the reasons chivalry made for tiresome tales, and why the world needed Don Quixote so badly.  The Chretien de Troyes version of Lancelot is repetitious, has many loose ends, and is full of plot holes.  Lancelot jumps into a cart to shame himself in pursuit of Guenivere.  Before Lancelot jumps into the cart, the narrator states that "reason is the enemy of love."  In the scope of the book, and the code of chivalry, reason is the enemy of this genre.  Take with Nyquil. 
 How do you write a mystery starring Benjamin Franklin and make it inconsequential?    This book started out well enough, plenty of neat "I didn't know that!" moments about the founding fathers but especially about Franklin, but the book fell far short.  the villain was incredibly one dimensional, the many threads of the story were left unraveled and the whole exercise seemed contrived and forced.  The mystery itself was trite.  I am very disappointed.  I am big fan of Mr. Lehrer but this book left me cold 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 It is clear that Professor Butler does not know Greek, knows little or nothing about both ancient Greek culture and the critical tradition of the play.  This work is a travesty of scholarship at every level: it is poorly written and tendentious, but above all it will be totally irrelevant to the group of scholars whom Butler might have intellectually transformed (or at least moved), namely, classicists.  The already converted will find this book indispensable--I can see it gathering dust on many theorists' bookshelves next to those other books it is so necessary to own, but never read (e. g., Bourdieu's Distinction and Derrida's Glas).  I await the day when academics as smart as Butler clearly is actually try to speak to people outside a coterie audience 
 At least until Ascension Coltrane could do no wrong for me. However, I recently heard Cookin' for the first time and was shocked at how bad his soloing was. Every one else - great. But I can only think something was wrong with Trane during the recording - maybe drug problems - but I am now wary about buying any of the rest of the Prestige 'set' despite all of the good reviews 
 We bought this wet/dry vac because we thought it would be handy to use on spills that occur on carpeting.  This does not work at all on wet spills - just smears them around making a bigger mess. I would not recommend this product.   
 Type Cooper's name into Google and learn about what a nut job he really was.  He allegedly threatened a neighbor with a hand gun.  A court issued an arrest warrant.  When two deputy sheriffs attempted to serve the warrant he shot one of them.  They returned fire, killing him 
 This book is pretty much the same as the rest, only more amateurishly done in many ways.  The rpint is big, it sort of looks like it was self-printed, and it has little research to back up what it says.  It offers idyllic, utopian notions of what teaching "should" be.  It doesn't ground itself in the real world, and the only saving grace is that the author admits that many of his ideas are more ideal than realistic.  He occasionally uses phrases like "I would be willing to bet...", as if somehow making guesses based on personal preferences  counts as quality educational theory.  There's nothing new offered by this book; it's the same issues being rehashed by another author.  It's not that the ideas are bad, it's just that there's nothing here that will surprise any teacher with more than a week's worth of experience 
 I got this Zafu(meditation cushion.) It is round in shape and too  high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on, around 9 inches high and 15-18 inches in diameter. It is also pretty heavy, around 4 pounds due to the sheer size.  I could not sit comfortably on it due to this reason returned it. I would recommend trying it somewhere before buying.  The filling seemed of good quality 
 I am yet to understand why this movie is compared to the likes of Platoon. There is no question which of the two is the better one. I was bored out of my mind after an hour. I turned it off and then when I had time to waste, I finished it. I am sorry I did. 2 Hours I will never get back. I know that evertone is different, but if you have not seen this movie and are thinking about viewing it, do so on a Sunday when you have NOTHING else to do. The only highlight was the Drill Instructor. He managed to crack a smile out me on occasion. 
 These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much! 
 If you know this music well, either from recordings or, better yet, playing it, the strengths and failures of Lang's performances are obvious.  He possesses a wonderful digital dexterity; he can play complicated, dense scores with real technical mastery.  And in Liszt, for example, this works reasonably well.  Yet, in contrast to Liszt, as Arthur Schnabel remarked, in Viennese classical music -- say Schubert and Haydn -- playing the notes in time is only ten percent of what's required to realize the music's potential.  The pianist needs to sing his way into the heart of the score.  Lang's failure, at this early stage in his career, is a failure to grasp the inner voices of pieces like Scubert's Wanderer Fantasy, performing a showy razzle dazzle instead of the profound song Schubert wrote. He has the raw talent to do this.  Does he have the heart and imagination?  Time will tell

 This is an unbelievably bad film. Its only redeeming features are the snippets of actual killer Gary Ridgeway's police interviews that are ocassionally spliced into the film's tawdry, fictionalized action scenes. I hadn't known this footage of Gary Ridgeway existed. A documentary consisting only of these interviews would have been infinitely more interesting than this trumped up movie.  The movie doesn't even minimally seem to care about accuracy or authenticity. For example, the extremely amateurish actor who plays Ridgeway doesn't match the real Ridgeway's physical description at all. The real Ridgeway was not a "tall, handsome, muscular" fellow. He was shorter, and unassuming-looking. Also, the majority of Ridgeway's victims were not the glamorous, seasoned barroom prostitutes shown here. They were lonely, struggling teenagers whom he picked up along the Seatac Highway.  If you want a better insight into the character of Ridgeway's victims and crimes, read Ann Rule's book, "Green River, Running Red." In any case, avoid this movie mess.  
 ... But even Ted Rall's best work doesn't merit 5 stars.  5 stars should be reserved for the giants of the graphic novel medium, Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore etc. I can understand how someone could like 2024, but five stars?!? I mean, come on!    I've liked Rall's comic strips.  His drawing style is unique and fun, and he's an intelligent guy.  He also has a lot of high quality ammunition to fire at this distopian comsumerist/techno crazy society.  Yet, 2024 lacked the #1 thing I've gone to his comics for ... humor!  Yes, there were a few funny parts, but not nearly enough to justify this much ink shed.  As for the politics, I'm afraid he's just going to be preaching to the converted here.    Try his web page for his free stuff, and maybe his collections (the worst thing I've ever done) before buying this.  
 I have read all of J. Kellerman's books and always found them fascinating..this one is just confusing.  Too many characters with way too much "conversation" with each.  One gets confused as to which one is which and why they are a concern to the case of the confession.  By the time you are half way through, you don't really care who died, you just want the story to get finished. Alex seems to be sort of the "outside looking in" and observing all this.  Thank goodness Milo is still Milo.  The Robin character is in need of some sort of mental therapy help herself and it seems peculiar that Alex would bother with her. 
 I really liked Platypus' Ice Cycles (at least the first half). This one is, however, forgettable. It has a few good licks but nothing catchy tyhat I remember like "Better Left Unsaid" from Ice Cycles. I think I listened to this CD two times max 
   This book was a disapointment for me. I am going to vacation on the northern California coast this Fall and was hoping to learn something from this book, but it is mostly just the well worn mainstream information that doesn't need retelling. It completely omits the area I'll be and the areas it does cover are handled more effectivly in other books. The pictures are great, though 
 This is the WORST prep book for the SAT (along with the Princeton Review's Math workout). Do not buy this, it is extremely short and is filled with errors ranging from incorrect answers to faulty grammar. Having grammatical errors in a SAT Reading and writing prep book shows how seriously PR takes the SAT. I felt like I was editing the damn thing.   Another thing to note is THEY USE THE SAME QUESTIONS MULTIPLE TIMES. I do not understand the point of this... too lazy to make up new questions? I bought both the Reading and Math book and feel cheated and used. This is a warning out there to everyone, do not waste your precious time on this book. As I have said in my other review, somebody sue these flukes. 
 This book at least had the redeeming quality of letting me know what not to do if I ever get laid off again (its already happened twice).  Networking with other unemployed individuals - a waste of time.  Resume polishing - get a book for $10 and do what it says.  This woman spent thousands of dollars and almost a year looking for a job with coaches and networking sessions (with other unemployed individuals!!).  She thought her problems might be related to her age or some other reason not her fault.  How about her work experience?  How about her skill set?  If you are looking for a job in a field where there aren't many available, then you might need to develop new skills.  I was 40 and had spent 6 years at home with my kids when I decided to go back to work.  I got 2 interviews and one job offer, which I accepted and was at work 6 weeks after starting my search. Due to being in a consolidating industry (banking) and to my lengthy time at home, I had only one reference from my previous jobs.  In 2001 I was laid off when my job was moved out of town, but I had a new one long before my severance checks ended.  The corporate world is very different from the writing world.  Barbara Ehrenreich is probably fine being a writer, but her comments make me believe that she would be a very poor participant in the corporate world.  Her comments about some of her fellow jobseekers were curious - didn't she realize that the woman who continued to wear suits to work into an environment where they were not considered appropriate & got fired for it, probably had a hard time getting a decent job because she did not take the clues around her about how to behave?   Her condescending attitude towards corporations is ridiculous.  She uses a computer, flies on planes, stays in hotels, visits Starbucks - all corporations that provide useful products & services and employment for millions.  They're not perfect, but neither are writers.  There are plenty of bad writers, just as there are some bad apple corporations.   Unemployment can be a problem as you get older.  My husband was laid off after 30 years at his (failing) company, but even at his age he was able to find a job before severance and unemployment ran out.  It wasn't easy but if you develop skills that are marketable (and PR may not be) and you are looking in an area with a good economy, then it is not impossible.  
 The story didn't seem believable..the editing was questionable and I just didn't care for it. I expected much more, I can't recommend it 
 This diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags, both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail BEFORE the reality of dirty diapers. Even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with Lysol between uses, it still smelled bad every time we opened it. Sometimes the smell seeped out, so it made the whole bedroom stink. And my kids have no problem pressing the blue lid-popping latch-and, of course, adding their toys or other opjects to the contents of the dirty diaper pail. The twisting mechanism to remove the full bag is a great idea. It helps you not get the face full of odor when you open the pail... BUT you cannot let the pail get even close to full, or it wont twist. And after two years of use, the twisting mechanism doesn't work anymore. The latch for the small opening is also broken 
 I was on a website reading about the current Mid East happenings (I am working in Kuwait now), and a banner ad talked about Nostradamus and world war 3 starting in 2007. Well I came to Amazon and came across this book, its one of the few that have reader comments on it. Then I read the excerpt : "Whereas prophecies up until this century have claimed that Israel and the Promised Land would be settled seven years prior to the arrival of the Messiah, this book proves that the advent period is, in fact, forty-two years, not seven. This discovery dates the settlement to the end of the Six-Day War in 1967, and indicates that the Messiah will therefore come in the year 2009." Does any of that passage raise an eyebrow? It does for me. Israel was made a country around 1947/8 I thought so where does this writer come up with using 1967? Well there's one explanation that I would believe, IT'S TO SELL A BOOK! Another comment, someone here said the world will be at war if our US leaders have their way, HUH? So our current leaders WANT world war 3? Please take a deep breath and go out of your apartment (maybe find a big park and walk around and look around, you've been cooped up on fringe web sites too long bouncing hate against others and its magnifying inside you). Did you think that the trade center bombing in 1993 was done by people who had a right to do it, and that the 9/11 attacks were a conspiracy by Bush? I really hope that your all talk and don't vote because the leaders you would put in power will probably empower more of this terror upon our western society. As for the book, I'll pass, thanks. 
 While Ms Shomon's book quotes several CFS doctors, she relies mainly on Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum's advice which includes a barrage of vitamins.  His book is titled "From Fatigued to Fantastic" and he wrote the introduction to Ms. Shomon's.  It bothers me that Ms. Shomon presents many alternative therapies that are highly suspect and cost prohibitive for the most of us.  However, she speaks from experience having suffered from CFS.  It bothers me that she does not mention Kutapressin, an amino acid injection that my doctor and many others in the field use 
 After enjoying the first novel in this series I was really looking forward to this sequel.  It started out pretty well but soon went downhill.  The plot is barely believable and the "woe is me" and handwringing gets old.  I don't think I'll even bother with the third book - wish I hadn't already bought it 
 I have only read the Neon Genesis Evangelion section (for a paper). From what I've read, it seems to me that Redmond makes provacative assertions that are annoyingly lacking in evidence. The Evangelion chapters largely consist of episode summaries, the majority of which has nothing to do with his thesis (that Evangelion is an allegory for East Asian regionalism). Redmond occasionally throws in generic terms such as "Asiazilla" and "East Asian subjectivity" to maintain a link to his thesis, but his weak analysis and sparse evidence on them only confused me. A book worth a glance only for its brevity and originality, as there isn't much literature that closely examines anime in the scope of East Asian regionalism.      
 The movie had potential: good cast and interesting plot.  Its the kind of movie you want to like, but just can't.  I did not find it all that funny or romanic.  It seemed that the mother and a bride's maid were suppose to be funny characters but I found neither very amusing.  I have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other; this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie.  Their relationship is not developed well at all.  As another reviewer noticed, there is a bit of Pretty Woman here, as Dermot plays a male escort.  For whatever reason, Julia Roberts as a hooker is cute, whereas Dermot is not.  I found is pretty disgusting that Messing falls for a male prostitute.  There is a lot of crude sexual humor that I didn't care for.  My favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the English countryside, which is really beautiful.  Its not a terrible movie, but I would be upset if I paid $10 to see it in the theater 
 this book is complete garbage....it has no moral or purpose just a bunch of bragging(ALTHOUGH IM A BIG LAKER FAN! 
 I just started back to work part time and thought this book would be a good system to help me get meals on the table for my family of seven. Big mistake!  This book has so many positive reviews that I thought I would give it a shot, but I should have listened to the few reviews that griped about the recipes because they really do stink. If this is the way the majority of Americans are eating, no wonder this nation has an obesity problem. If you aren't obese, you will be if you use these recipes. Examples:  Cheeseburger Quiche 45g fat Beef Cube mix 22g fat Make-ahead Chimichangas 19g fat Baked Salmon with Mustard Crumb Crust 26g fat  Lite versions are given, but they include things like fat free cheese and mayonnaise which I think is disgusting. Many of these recipes call for a can of mushroom soup or other soup mixes which my dietary friend said are extremely high in sodium.  After freezing meals, they still need to be thawed and reheated which takes as much time as preparing something fresh. In my opinion, if you want something quick and healthy, stick with grilled chicken or fish brushed with olive oil and seasonings, a bag of salad, and grab a loaf of fresh whole grain bread on your way home from work. The best facet about this book is that it forces you to plan your menus, shopping, and cooking sessions, but with discipline and motivation, you don't need this book to do that. 
 Fable is a sprawling and beautiful game with many layers, many puzzles, and many many little details that a player might want to keep better track of. The dual nature of the game allows one to follow paths of either good or evil to the story's end - or a meandering walkway somewhere in between - allows just enough room to complete the game without ever exploring vast portions of the world provided.   These strategy guides do make a good quick-reference manual to flip through as you play should you not wish to get up and run to your computer every time you have a specific question you need answered. So if a player lacks internet access and feels lost, or would like a exhaustingly complete manual at hand to decide whether you really want to use the obsidian longsword or the steel katana - or you just want to make sure you've seen everything and haven't missed anything on your grand tour of Peter Molyneux's vision... then I still really recommend consulting the internet.  While these paper guides do have very high production values, with great art direction and some well-rendered stills or original concept art supplied directly by the game's producer - and they might hold some sentimental value as a collector's item to the ultimate fan, they are worthless as an informational source in an age of internet. There are plenty of fan sites offering detailed lists of equipment and monsters (what they do, and where to find them), and walkthroughs for every quest in the entire game - and they will cost you nothing. 
 I bought this shopping cart for my grandaughters age 22 and 23 months old. They love pushing it around without the baby seat, without the basket. In other words they are quite adept at taking it apart & rolling around the frame. The doll is difficult to put in, the cardboard groceries were put away until they are older. The other groceries are fine, the pouring milk container is great as are the pretend veggies & mac n cheese. They both put them in the containers. I am disappointed and was looking for a shopping cart that my own daughters had, that actually looks like a cart & doesn't disassemble so easily 
 Misled by its title, I was expecting that this book was about making rustic furniture. However only the last third of the book is about this. Two thirds of the books (100 p.) consists in  a gallery of pictures (with some comments), mostly chairs. Their style is not modern, but not traditional either. I find most to be weird or snob. Actually many look postmodern to me (they may not all be from the author, but from his friends -many being also from New York City like him). These may be a source of inspiration for some, but definitely not what I am looking for.  And that last third of the book, about making things is also quite a deception in itself. It is a collection of shallow articles by other authors, who show projects they make,   with a very vague and general talk about the technique they use. One uses tenons and mortises (anyone knowing a bit about conventional woodworking will not learn anything here), and worse, others use nails and even bolts (the last one). I really learned nothing from this. In addition, this is all about dry wood.   I recommend instead Les Smith's Build your own Log Furniture (only a little bit of technique, for dry softwood, but at least something...), and much more a book where you really can learn many things: Drew Langsner's Green Woodworking 
 Amanda Pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity, but otherwise this film did nothing for me. A bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests? I can't even relate. And they're trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness? Yeah right! See it if you're a big fan of fart jokes, or whatever.. 
 I received 50% refund on returning the product in original condition since I did not like what I received. Why such a high deduction? You should require merchant to post the refund amount when ordering. I also paid for shipping the product back thus resulting in only 25% refund of what I paid originally.  
 This is a waste of black ink on white paper. Save your money 
 I never quite understood why everyone seemed to love this book so much. I read it, along with my entire grade, in seventh grade, and found the book to be annoying. I was especially annoyed by flawed characters, and a not very impressive writing style. Many people are impressed by this book, saying it is an accurate portrayal of life then. I understand and respect that. Many books are accurate. That does not make them good. In this case, it's a book that is reasonable (not terrible, no), and at the same time has many deep flaws, the chief of which is the characters. To put it simply, I was unimpressed by the book, and don't understand why it is considered something so incredible. It is just an ordinary, okay-quality book 
 I personally did not like this book.  I am pretty new to Access but I am young so I pick these programs up pretty fast.  My work involved some advanced query work for data scrubbing.  The book goes over every single function but does not go into depth about it.  When it described a object (IE: list boxes), i really needed to know how Access stores the data and how i can access it, but the book was no help.  I got a feel for the program's functions but could not use this book as a reference when i was coding.  I wanted to use this book like i used Excel 2003 Bible, with the detail that I could refer too.  Maybe I was looking for too much 
 This is THE perfect book for those that hate SUV's, dispise Republicans, love political correctness, and don't care about accuracy.  If inaccuracies and blatant science nonsense offend you, this book will offend you.   
 Brenda Maddox' ROSALIND FRANKLIN: THE DARK LADY OF DNA and ROSALIND FRANKLIN AND DNA by Anne Sayre both imply that Rosalind Franklin was the true discoverer of DNA and that James Watson & Francis Crick, with the help of Maurice Wilkins, stole her discovery.  Rosalind Franklin was no doubt an excellent scientist, a molecular biologist, who, along with Linus Paulding in the US, sought to solve the puzzle of DNA. She was a painstaking researcher, who compiled much of the fundamental data on the subject (in the form of x-ray photos of DNA). Her work provided the crucial information that enabled Watson & Crick to make their breakthrough discovery of the structure of DNA.  But the fact remains that, while she had the information, she did not make the discovery. Watson & Crick did. Could she have arrived at their conclusion give more time and more research? Perhaps. But the question is irrelevant. She didn't. They did. Watson & Crick did not "steal" her discovery. They made it on their own - no doubt with the invaluable help of her data.   But that is the way scientific discoveries are made. The great breakthroughs are always based on previous inconclusive research and data compiled by other scientists. Such information is the common property of the scientific community, not the private property of individual researchers. Progress is made through the sharing of data, studies and findings. Science progresses not in secret, but through an open system of shared information.   The credit for any scientific discovery goes to those who reach the solution first, not to those who work toward the solution or provide the data on which the solution is ultimately based.   The fact is that such discoveries are often the result of a combination of painstaking research and illuminating insight. Rosalind Franklin was a painstaking researcher. But it was Watson & Crick who had the brilliant insight.  I believe that this episode is an example of Thomas Kuhn's theory of the function of paradigms - the framework of existing concepts that dominate any field of human endeavor. The effect of paradigms is to "blind" those who work within the existing conceptual framework to possibilities that become visible to those who work "outside the box," - i.e. outside the paradigm. To work within an existing paradigm is to expect a certain solution and, inevitably, to look for that solution.   I believe that this is probably what happened with the discovery of DNA. While Rosalind Franklin was working within the framework of the existing molecular biological paradigm, Watson & Crick stepped outside the box and were able to view the data in a new and different way. This was because neither Watson (a zoologist & bacteriologist) nor Crick (a physicist turned chemist) were molecular biologists and were therefore not trapped in the existing paradigm of molecular biology. This enabled them to see what Franklin and Paulding didn't see. Therefore, it was Watson & Crick who became the discoverers of the structure of DNA and received the credit, and the Nobel Prize they fully deserved.  To give Rosalind Franklin credit for the research she did and the data she so painstakingly assembled (data which enabled Watson & Crick to make their breakthrough discovery) is a generous thing. But for these authors to imply that they "stole" her discovery is inaccurate. It has far less to do with the pursuit of scientific or historic truth than it does with the pursuit of a feminist agenda. 
 Now I like Neruda. I think he is an important poet, and I fully expected to love this collection. But as I read it I found that I didn't really like any of the poems. There were a few that were almost passable, but only a couple. I don't know if it was Merwin's translation, Neruda's writing, or just me not connecting with the poetry. I say read Neruda, just not this collection 
 The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.   Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who Meredith is, and what she looks like.   Meanwhile, Princess Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry.   Jesus wept.   And for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope, she's just incognito, baby.   At which point I almost threw down the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels, including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually 
 Bad news is that I wasted my time listening to this whinefest. Good news is that I bought it used.  I give it two stars because there are two tolerable songs on the CD and she is a cutie.  More good news. I re-sold it for my purchase price 
 The writer of this book is so much in love with himself and it is so much of a theme that I simply had to put the book down.  You can find what you need elsewhere if you cant bear to listen to Bob Glover praise himself, thats what I did 
 In my opinion I don't suggest this book to kids that are younger that 13 years old because of the language it has and how it tells you that drugs are the only thing that could make you feel better. As well as, how the teenagers made a bad choices in their life. When I finished the book, I felt like drugs is the only thing I need now, which I know is wrong and I'm not even going to take any, but my point is that someone who'll probably finish the book might think that and do it.  This book is basically about two young teenagers Gemma and Tar who decided to run away from home and go to Bristol. Where they met new friends and started taking drugs and making bad choices, but then they started to realize of what they were doing is wrong, but they cannot stop taking drugs, and so this story unfolds of how Gemma and Tar find their way back home, through the path of where some of their friends had died or even went to the hospital and jails for the rest of their lives, but Gemma and Tar work together to make it safe and sound. 
 I bought this CD for my girlfriend who has gotten into Irish folk music just recently. She quite likes it but I was  disappointed with it.  The problem with The Corrs and some other Irish & English performers is that they feel a need to adopt a 'mid-atlantic' accent while singing, which means much of their native tongue goes missing. This works well for pop & rock etc but less so for folk singing.  Irish artists like Maura O'Connell, Mary Black or even Enya in a pinch could have performed any of these songs better than The Corrs.  I did note that acoustic guitars made in Northern Ireland were used on the CD - that was a nice touch. Otherwise The Corrs should stick to the bubble gum, eye candy pop singing they're used to 
 This book didn't cut it.  Too contrived for my taste, and unlike the first 2 books, there was some real slow going.  This series should have stopped at 2 books--there really wasn't more to tell, and Sergeril's homeland just isn't enough to fill a book.  Still, check out the first 2 books and read some really good fantasy with a nice take on the orphan boy plot device 
 I was amongst a small group of forensic physicists/archaeologists studying the effects of the Tower collapse along Liberty Street and near Ten House. After a year of balking at FEMA video showing the cab of 4 Truck empty during its discovery and excavation, Mr. L. finally admitted in late 2003 that he was in fact not present in New York City during the December 2001 excavation of 4 Truck. This did not prevent him from presenting, in his book, his firsthand eyewitness account of 4 Truck having been stuffed to the gills with stolen jeans, folded and tagged and, according to mr. L's own forensic archaeological interpretation, forming the basis for a broad accusation of looting, by firefighters, as the Towers burned. Much as FEMA video of 4 Truck, showing a complete absence of Mr.L's observed stolen items, proved no obstacle to his accusation of looting... Nor did the April 2002 discovery of 4 Crew's remains at the South Tower elevator banks, with their Hurst cutting tool... nor the two women survivors cut free by 4 Crew, with their Hurst cutting tool. Mr. L. just had to tell his tall, and controversial, and money-making tale - with no indication whatsoever that he gave even an atom of thought to the pain he inflicted upon the widows and children of 4 Truck. I will add that before the Federal government came in with an acceptable protocol against a "dirty bomb" attack, I worked briefly with the crew most likely to be first responders. At one point these men were told that this was not what they had signed on for; and anyone with small children was practically ordered to transfer to another unit. They all stayed. Every one of them. All of the FDNY, PAPD and NYPD people I have worked with (add to this the "civilians" who ran toward the fires, and assisted in the rescue operation)convince me that this city and this country have more good people than bad, and that whatever challenges lie ahead, it is the good people all around us who virtually assure that we shall prevail. During this very same time period, having observed from within how the publishing industry coddled Mr. L., even after it was revealed beyond all serious dispute that he had lied about 4 truck, I have become equally convinced that the only truth Jayson Blair (of "Burning Down My Master's House" fame)ever told was that he found himself being singled out and punished in public for what was, in his industry, "simply business as usual." 
 J.D. Salinger's last published work is more than 43 years old now, and still stirs many in the same absent way Seymour Glass animates his brother Buddy in this pair of stories first published in 1963. Are both cases of delusional devotion?  In the first story, "Raise High The Roof Beam, Carpenters," originally published in The New Yorker in 1955, we get what amounts to Salinger's first deep-dish treatment of the Glass family saga ("Zooey" saw print later, and previous stories featuring the Glasses were far less insular) as Buddy shows up for Seymour's wedding, only to find Seymour stood up his bride. In the second piece, 1959's "Seymour: An Introduction," Buddy foregoes any semblance of plot to explain who Seymour was.  Like a lot of other people, I am put off by the convoluted nature of "Seymour," as well as the explanations of those who defend it. Actually, there could be something to the idea of writing a plotless story, using characters like the Glasses people know from other works, but this is assuredly not it. Salinger too obviously indulges himself, spouting contempt at his generation and his critics, throwing up lame jokes and referencing obscure Japanese poets as a smokescreen to conceal his literary, intellectual, and metaphysical nakedness.  "What a marvelous convenience it would be if writers could let themselves describe their characters' clothes, article by article, crease by crease," Salinger writes in the role of Buddy, pretty much summing up the approach of "Seymour" as well as its underlying failure. His interest in his subject is not only all-consuming, it is not all that deep.  "Raise High" is a better story, though that's not saying much. "Franny And Zooey," the previously published Salinger book, also combined a better story with a weaker one, but there at least you got one terrific story in "Franny," a bold, empathetic tale of power and focus. "Raise High" doesn't know where it's going, and is in no hurry to get there. You get nice asides, like when Buddy sees an old chair and remembers a beloved bulldog, long dead, who slept there and left his chewmarks. There's also some arresting ambiguity, as when Buddy reads Seymour's journal and we get maybe a suggestion of unease at some apparent insanity.  But "Roof Beam" doesn't end so much as fizzle away, with Buddy snoozing in an empty apartment after the mystery of Seymour's absence has been resolved via an unseen phone call. Emptyness is a recurrent theme in Salinger's Glass writings, here as in "Franny & Zooey," where various Glasses are often seen in isolation thinking or writing about absent kin. For such a happy family, there's an overwhelming sadness about the Glasses that suggests Salinger found himself in a bit of a dead end with them, one from which he never emerged. Further evidence of this can be found in the web-available "Hapsworth 16, 1924," Salinger's last public blast, published in The New Yorker in 1965.  Salinger was one of the most important American writers of our lifetime, not to mention a seminal figure of our culture, but his greatness lies elsewhere, not here. Read this only if you are a Salinger completist, or else interested in the price genius can extract from its recipients 
 I felt like I was taking a piss on myself the whole time I listened to this album. What happened to the 40 water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1, 2pac, and mc breed? This clone of 40 raps with the likes of Lil jon (wack as hell), washed up 80 year old too short, and a bunch of losers I have never heard of. The album only gets props because eightball and mjg are on the album and ugk. And they almost played themselves by appearing on this god awful so called "album". E-40 has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk called "hyphy" in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless career. The album has some decent beats on it but there is no kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. E-40 wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Krs-One cd. This cd is wack simple and plain, Pee-40 is a beat waster, and he needs to find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!! 
 I admire Dr. Virtue and her Healing with the Angel cards are absolutely incredible.  But when I purchased this tape, I expected something a little more educational.    The message I took from this is that if you pray and visualize, your negative karma can be taken away.  It seems like the meditation just focuses on and repeats that message, which I found overly simplistic.    The tape is ok for neophytes -- but if you're looking for something with a little more meat, try some of her other materials.  Even for neophytes, I would highly recommend Marianne Williamson's Return to Love tape over this one.   
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 I enjoyed "Temple" but this book was just awful.  Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes.  You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time.  In this book however there were two elements that were just so bad that they ruined the rest of the adventure.  1) The career Marine captain has a romance with an NCO who reports to him.    and 2)There was a bear family that played a key role in the story - mama bear, baby bear and papa bear.  Right.  The only place you will fine a papa bear in a bear family is in Goldylocks.  Read "Temple" instead 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 This book gains no real traction beyond the dust cover's framing of the conspiracy theory around the Carlyle group.  Facts stated in the first few chapters are often repeated later on in the book and you end up asking yourself, ''yeah so what?''.  Not clear what the author's angle is, he doesn't appear to have any special information on the interworkings of Carlyle and remains just an outsider compiling information easily available from various sources.  Ultimately the book fails to tell a cohesive story and instead results in a semblance of newspaper articles or magazine features with the author's views often repeated and reiterated throughout the book in a monotonous and droning voice with not the slightest bit of climax. However, if you are rather simple minded and a non business oriented individual, you may find the book's lack of factual basis and meaning is quite just your speed. 
 Published in the early 1990s, this book puts forth the thesis that the end of the Cold War, and its victory by the US, marked a significant turning point in history.  Specifically, mankind can see the light at the end of the tunnel of history, that the liberal democracy that is America at the end of the Cold War is pretty close to a perfect society and once every society reaches this stage, mankind has reached the end of history.  No more wars, no more revolutions, no more upheavals, etc, etc.  Of course, events in the next decade up to and after the 9-11/2001 terrorist attacks proved this book all wrong.  Mankind is nowhere near the end of history; in fact we might be staring at a very long war between established governments and multinational terrorist groups.  And the dot.com bust, the Enron and related scandals, and now the economic and social wreckage due to a summer's worth of hurricanes shows that liberal democracies like the US are not even close to being optimal societies in terms of managing people - people or people - nature relationships.  I believe this book is even more foolish; that its thesis and its premise was flawed even in 1993, and that the author should have known better than to publish such bullcrap.    First, the human population continues to grow.  Yet the amount of arable land and drinkable water is not increasing.  This can only lead to conflicts.  It led to conflicts in the past, and will only lead to more conflicts in the future.  We are seeing it happen already; every year the SW states in the USA duke it out in courts over water access.  Every year the Jews and Palestinians in Israel bicker over water access.  And of course we have at least one war per decade over oil; whether it be in the Middle East or somewhere else.  As the world's population grows, we are only going to have more wars, and since wars make great history, a lot more history to go thru.  Second, the author's premise that America is a liberal democracy is totally false.  America is a corporate democracy.  Pull over 100 people on any American city street (D.C. excepted) and ask them who their congressmen is, or who their state representative is, or even who their mayor is, and after a slight pause, the most common answer would be "I DO NOT KNOW".  On the other hand, ask him/her how their 401K is doing, or how is their mutual fund performing, and you will get a certain answer.  This discrepancy of awareness and involvement between civic society and the corporate world can only mean one thing; America is a corporate democracy.  An even more potent sign; many of the prisons, schools, and health care facilities in the US are increasingly run in part or in whole by corporations.  Three of the most fundamental aspects of any society; criminal punishment, health care, and education, are run by corporations in the US.  Third, democracies don't always last.  A Roman Republic over 300 years old converted to dictatorship in under a century.  The area that is now Poland was comprised of democratic states throughout the Middle Ages.  These were successively conquered by their bigger neighbors (France, Germany, Russia) and subjected to dictatorships.  The Native American tribes throughout the N. American continent were all democracies in the purest sense of the word.  From 1776 - 1910, each and every single one of them was either destroyed, displaced, or absorbed by one nation that only allowed white males to rule; the USA.  Last, in any given time period, the democratic nations that exist are usually expanding their possessions, usually be conquering less democratic nations.  Semi-democratic, aristocratic England conquered the Middle East and India.  Democratic France conquered N. Africa.  And of course the US has defeated or taken over various countries such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Spain and the Philippines, all of which were less democratic than the US.  Democracy does not put an end to man's greed, it only channels it outwards towards its neighbors near and far.  All in all, a book of false conclusions based on false premises.  It is worthy of reading if only to see the mistakes in its logic and arguments 
 The author keeps referring to the LDS church as a cult. By definition a cult is: A religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader. In Christ's day many would have considered his movement (Christianity) a cult by definition and now it's the largest religious form of worship in the world. So let Mormons do their thing. There's upwards of 12,000,000 of them now so I guess they're not a cult anymore 
 This item is not as functional as I thought.  I miscalculated the size which is not big enough for my purpose.  Also, the brittle like surface is cracking and peeling off. I was going to exchange or return the item but the packaging was discarded too soon 
 After the many glowing reviews of this book, I was ready to love it.  But I just couldn't.  What really bothered me was I felt Daniel made totally unrealistic advances in a short period of time.  In real life, language acquisition in non-verbal autistic kids is a slow process.  My son was diagnosed over 5 years ago, and I still remember the pain the diagnosis brought, so I could relate to Melanie.  The disorder is not as easily improved as is shown here. 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 The book seems to be more for scoring political points rather than genuine scholarship. The first line in the description says it all - "A book the government of India demands be ritually burned". The BJP led govt. is "demanding" and book to be burned, but "hasn't". While individual members in the BJP govt. are entitled to their own opinion, the govt as a whole hasn't made a policy of banning it. The Allahbad high court (which is totally different than the BJP led govt) has on grounds of hurting public sentiment. Which means this book is banned via the valid legal process.  This book is a publicity stunt and rehash of the work done by other renowned authors/historians previously 
 This book is really only for a man who is married with 2.3 kids a good job and goes to Christian that goes to church every Sunday.  It is not for someone who is single, not Christian and has no kids.  In one of the last chapters is says the best help comes from your employer, your wife, your kids, your church and your friends.  What if you are self-employed who is going to help?  What if you have no wife? No kids? No church? No friends to confide in?  I find it hard to believe that the author has a Ph.D. and is President of a mid-life crisis centre and still has such a narrow view on society and on how people live today.   Don't get me wrong this book is not all that bad, it did help to see that there are other men going through the same thing as me.  Just be forewarned that one of the PhD's mentioned above is in theology and that the author is a pastor even though he says this book is for Christians and unbelievers that there is a bible passage at the end of every chapter.  ....Hmmm what if your Jewish, does that make you a unbeliever 
 Sharon Stone reprises the role of crime novelist Catherine Tramell that made her internationally famous back in 1992. The truth is, she shouldn't have.  `Basic Instinct 2' has no sizzling sex appeal of leg-crossing Catherine 14 years ago. She is (I mean Sharon Stone) is still beautiful, posing before David Morrissey's police psychoanalyst who diagnoses her as `being addicted to risk' with his very serious face. In fact, she is seen in the opening scene doing you know what in the car madly driving in the street of London that ends up with a bizarre traffic accident.   I know Michael Caton-Jones is trying to set the tone of the entire film. He succeeds, but unintentionally as making it a campy comedy. Sharon Stone does not miss a single chance to change her fancy dresses, posing before the embarrassed and ensnared David Morrissey, delivering such lines as would be imprinted in your memories long after watching the film, about very insightful commentary about Oedipus and the smell of the crime scenes. Seriously, I am greatly impressed with Sharon Stone who can deliver such nonsense without making us bored.   Aside from the uncanny ability of Sharon Stone who can be in outrageous character, `Basic Instinct 2' has nothing that would justify making the long-delayed sequel. Murders are shown by the number way; the trauma of the psychiatrist (virtually recycling the same material as the original) is just uninteresting; and the worst is the dearth of sexual thrills surrounding Catherine. Sharon Stone looks sexy, that is good, but few scenes can successfully convey the suggested dangers behind this character.  The supports like David Thewlis, Hugh Dancy and Charlotte Rampling are also wasted (especially Dancy who appears and soon goes away). The confusing climax and a `big surprise' (or is it?) is annoying bad, having no impact on us whatever. Do those who made this film really mean THAT as ending?  It is true that you just cannot take your eyes off Sharon Stone, but not the same reason as she was in the original, which was really erotic and exciting. This one is simply not 
 Outfoxed is a propaganda pure and simple.  It is made by left-wingers and is prejudicial, if not more so, than the Fox News.   It is made by people who see some kind of Great Right Wing Conspiracy in the media.   It is made by people who like to silence any fair exchange of ideas and who want to dominate the news cycle with their contrived and simplistic stories that left-wing Democrats are the good guys and right-wing Republicans are monsters who want to molest children, take away lunch programs, and discriminate against women and minorities.    People who praise this film think it meets some kind of standard of real journalism, but it doesn't.  It is not necessary to pretend that it is anything other than what it is. It is a  propaganda film as was Triumph of the Will.  The ersatz "journalists" behind this anti-Fox diatribe are objecting to the fact that there are conservative opinion shows on Fox news channel.   They don't like that some News channel would give a voice to conservative opinions because that makes it more difficult for them to achieve their own hidden agendas.  The would prefer that if you have to put conservative voices on the airways you surround that one voice with five or six liberal voices to keep it in check and to make it appear that the conservative voice is an out of the mainstream of American political life point of view.  The propagandists behind this film deliberately confuse that fact with the fact that there are also news programs on Fox.  It is the necessary plot of their lame story line.  People who praise this film as some kind of real journalism, either don't understand the difference or are themselves political hacks.   The bottom line is that they are jealous that Fox has been successful at what it does, and that they are nothing but failures at what they do. 
 Every summer brought the drive in my in-laws' car from Stockton to Santa Cruz. I was not a California native,only marrying into a California family so I was not familiar with the state's history.I just remember California seeming so vivid and alive.  Joan Didion narrates her family's move west and the intertwined history of the state and her family. Not only do we learn of family, but of the changes in the society. California has always struck me as a restless  state, ever on the move, turning to the next idea or trend. Didion follows her family's history, the eventual erosion of the ties to the land and agriculture and the huge immigrant wave. There are the huge industrial closedowns and the urban sprawl and growth. This is a book for anyone who loves California, but not nearly as revealing about the author nor her roots.  
 This album is probably one of the biggest wastes of money I ever spent! Streisand needs to get some advise on what to record. Her albums were once such a joy. Now, just pure junk! And the photos-- it made me want to puke-- almost more than her dedication of "Higher Ground" to Clinton's overbearing mother. Well, what do you expect from a clueless socialist 
 One of a few dozen books from the right upset that the Courts are working exactly as the founding fathers intended: independant and not accountable to the political hacks who run the other two branches of government. 
 My 3 1/2 year old son enjoys this book, and I'll admit that the illustrations are great, but I find the text of this book lacking.  For example on page 40, the text reads: "I'm supposed to be played with," he decided"--is this even correct grammar?  The choppiness of the text, lack of flow, and overuse of exclamation points makes the story a disappointment to read 
 I haven't read this book, although I expect that it is probably very good since J.A. Jance wrote it.  I have buying all her books for some years. However, I have been buying paperback books for a lot longer, probably longer than Jance has been writing.  But NOW, book publishers, not satisfied with an average increase of more than 30% in the retail price, have come up with a "new" size for more comfortable reading.  BALONEY!! It's for greed! I do not intend to buy this new size.  Having carried paperbacks in my briefcase for more than 50 years.  I doubt that the publishers will even notice.  After all, I am 80+ years of age and the volume of my book buys are of little interest to the new breed of publishers. I will miss my many favorite authors but not for long. Goodbye, Adios, Adieu, and vaya con DIOS.  J. Dwayne Taylor - jdlet@tstar.ne 
 Cobra HG A1500 High Gear CB Antenna has an Item model number: HG A1000 and the Cobra HG A1000 High Gear CB Antenna has an Item model number: HG A1500.  So clearly it seems the inventory numbers are erroneously swapped-  Called two weeks ago- no fix and called today.  Hopefully it's corrected since I can't settle with the lower wattage rated antenna 
 Not EVEN one star... I really can't even constructively criticize this, as you have to have some sort of substance to build on in the first place. This is pure fluff at best. Cookie-cutter, bland, wannabe... take your pick. There's little or nothing there. Now Idol is a guilty pleasure for me as much as the next gal. But when you look at the big guns that have gone thru this competition: Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Chris Daughtry, Carrie Underwood, this album is not even on the radar.   In fact, throughout the entire CD, you can almost hear the Senator's daughter tugging on Daddy's sleeve whining "Daddy, they kicked me off their silly show! Daddy, I wanna make a CD, TOO! Daddy, make them listen to me sing! 
 I enjoyed the first part of this CD but it left me flat when it went into Hindu gods.  Don't get me wrong--if you can believe that wtuff feel free but as a Christian I don't plan to flirt with breaking the first commandant.  I thought the CD would be more in line with Buddhism.  Buddha, as I understand it, did not believe in God, per se, but he was a very admirable person and did a lot of good for the human race.  I am also a great admirer of the Dalai Lama.  I did give this CD to a nurse who is a Buddhist and she enjoyed it.  I also like Deepak Chopra and wouldn't I love to have his money 
 The analysis of the housing bubble in this book does not go beyond what is found in the general press.  Save your money!  We were looking for regional analysis of the housing bubble, likely scenarios as to how the housing bubble will correct, and how the correction will effect different housing segments (condos, started home, high end properties, etc.).  
 The acting was terrible, there was basically no plot. If this movie represents a woman's view of the Conan movie genre, then that's just very sad. Red Sonya was better 
 I was hoping this book would have more to offer. Its a fun read to look at all the various travel locations, but it didn't offer much at all in terms of helpful advice. It's more like a travel book than anything else and it actually caters more to readers in a high income bracket than to the average bride looking to plan a wedding her guests could reasonably attend 
 Not a great deal of new insight here. I did learn a bit more than I knew, however, about Meade's failure to pursue at Gettysburg. Mr. Boritt is the editor and author of one essay; other essays are by four historians: Stephen W. Sears, Mark E. Neely, Jr., Michael Fellman, and John Y. Simon. (Alan J. Jacob 
 After chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead-end romance, she finally buys the house.  Aha, I thought, the story begins.  But alas, not much happens.  Then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house, and I think, OK here's the story, but not to be.  Then there is the architect that enters - a good love story - no.   Danielle Steel had the makings of three great story lines but failed to develop any of them.  The story of the grandmother's life in the house would have been tremendous.  I think maybe she had a Visa bill to pay and had to get a book out quickly, because she did not put any thought into this one.  Where was the editor on this one?  It was a bummer.  Virgini 
 Dr. Gullo has quite a few good ideas here.  My problem is, #1, most of them are already in "Thin Tastes Better"; and #2, the book is blatantly padded, which drives me nuts. The useful material could be condensed down to about 30 pages -- so, to make the book long enough, he repeats every idea about 30 times.  He mentions the GG Bran Crispbread on literally every page... which brings me to annoyance #3:  as other reviewers have suggested, most of his recommended foods are nearly impossible to find.  Absolutely NO ONE in my area carries the bran crispbread; I finally mail-ordered some, only to discover that it's barely edible -- it tastes like thin sheets of wood.  It's bearable if topped with something, but really awful eaten plain.  Take my advice and forget about it -- just get yourself some Ry-Krisp, Finn Crisp or even reduced-fat Triscuits (my staple!).  I finally found Fage yogurt, and it's very expensive ($1.99 for an individual 7-8 oz. cup) -- AND it's only available in either fat-free (which I don't like) or very high fat (250 calories per 8 oz).  I did find Walden Farms salad dressings, but when I saw that they're labeled "Calorie Free," I decided they would probably be vile-tasting and put them back on the shelf.  I also found Vitamuffins, but if you read the ingredient lists, they are NOT particularly healthy:  the top three ingredients in their "Cran-Bran Muffins" are water, sugar, and white flour!  Bran is way down the list, and the fiber content is not high.  So I didn't buy those either.  I was glad to know that Alba shakes are still being made, although again, you have to mail-order them.    Dr. G. does have good behavior modification suggestions.  I think he's absolutely on the money about "trigger foods" and always carrying a snack pack with you.  But again, I believe all of that is in "Thin Tastes Better." 
 I live on the Vineyard and let's just say, this cook book does not represent island living in the least. The island is filled with an eclectic mix of people but you would never know it by this book. It tries a little too hard, says very little, is not innovative and seems to feel that it is better than the rest of us by showing some pictures and recipes of some celebrities and those who like to hang out with them. I have tried many of the recipes and few are memorable. The chatter written by the authors of the book and of each individual recipe seems overwritten and trite. Give me some humor, some grit, some wit. These are some pretty self-absorbed people. Lighten up, people. Let's hope this is the LAST of this series... 
 This is not one of Kellerman's best books.  I was so looking forward to the book coming out, but I was sadly disappointed with it.   The premise of the story was fine, Dr. Alex Delaware receives a scrapbook in the mail containing murder scene photos. These photos bring back haunting memories to Delawares friend, Milo Sturgis, who is a homicide detective.  As a matter of fact, these photos look familiar.  This was a great way to start the story, and I was hooked, but soon it all became confusing with too many characters and in a effort to keep the identity of the killer secret til the end of the book, the plot got fuzzy.  I usually love his books, but he missed the mark on this one.   If you are reading Kellerman for the first time, don't get this one.  If you are a returning fan, skip this one and use the 8 bucks for something better 
 I've just finished my first script. I suppose it's okay, but not awesome. I've read a half dozen books on screenplays. Of those books, this one is likely one of the least helpful. It was writen in 1983!! and hasn't been updated. I suspect that much of the formatting advice this book offers is now out of date, old fashioned to what professional script writers are doing this days. Two newer books I would recommend instead would be CRAFTY SCREENWRITING by Alex Epstein (2002) and HOW NOT TO WRITE A SCREENPLAY by Denny Flinn (1999). You'll get modern formatting information from these books PLUS a lot more useful advice about how to write well 
 This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales 
 The WHO sound tired and uninterested, espessially live they are horrible.....whatever happened to this great band... 
 Cagle's book has a wide variety of cartoons in various styles, but the book is badly hampered by Cagle's insistence that political cartoonists are primarily left-leaning (10 to 1 was the claim, which he ironically justifies by suggesting that liberals think that people are mostly "stupid" and so since that's where humor lies, there are naturally more liberals in cartooning.  He also refers to conservatives as humorless - as a stereotype, to be fair - but one that makes you wonder if the man has ever read P.J. O' Rourke, Jonah Goldberg, Rob Long, Mark Steyn, or listened to Rush Limbaugh, just to name a few.)  Cagle then goes on to pander to that assumption my placing an overwhelming number of liberal cartoonists in the pages, mildly broken up by the odd conservative cartoon.  The intros to the chapters are full of misinformation (One example is the matter of fact state ment that there's a civil war going on in Iraq...not yet, though sadly I'm sure that's wishful thinking on some leftists' part - but a country whose factions are all working towards a single government is not in civil war - there's a difference between that and a country wracked by terror.  Another: In the intro to cartoons on Hurricane Katrina, there wasn't a single mention of Governor Blanco or Mayor Nagin, an appaling omission.)  Even the chapter selections, including a section on Pat Robertson, but leaving out Howard Dean and the DNC which got a fair amount of attention from political cartoonists (and writers) this past year demonstrates a kind of calculated bias on Cagle's part.  The main problem though is that the intellectual quality of political cartooning has diminshed considerably in the past two decades.  This was already apparent when Berke Breathhead won a well-deserved award for Bloom County some years back, an award richly deserved over the polemical and often plainly didactic work of the majority of political cartoonists then and unfortunately now.  Cagle's collection is full of works that rely on the most biased, unfair, and extreme take on events, a take which will leave many readers on both left and right scratching or even shaking their heads.    However, to be fair to Cagle, this sort of simplistic bias is well rewarded by the media and the same establishment that liberals always seem to rail against, forgetting that they form a large part of it.  Anderson's Pulitzer portfolio was embarrassingly didactic and ham-fisted, and example of an award that seems to have been given out because it was one cartoonist's time.  The art of the cartoons vary and it is still nice to see some artists using brushwork and detail, even in the face of the increasingly small spaces newspapers give their artists to work with.  Ultimately though, Cagle's book is a sad reminder of the fact that the polemics of the overrated Post cartoonist Herblock  have trumped the more balanced and thoughful approach of a cartoonist like Mauldin.  That probably shouldn't be such a surprise in an age where partisan rancor is extremely high and unbearably dishonest.  To see it celebrated though is a kick in the gut to those of us who have followed and admired political cartooning for decades.  One hopes this the a deep valley from which this valuable craft shall emerge.  Right now though, that's seems a day too far off 
 first off 1 star because you can't give no stars!! THIS IS ONE OF THE DUMBEST AND SILLY HORROR MOVIES EVER MADE . IT REALLY STINKS AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY BOTHERED TO PUT IT ON DVD. NOT SCARY,NOT FUNNY, JUST THE WORST!!!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY ANYTHING BUT THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!! 
 Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages 
 Maybe it was just that this book was too simple but I found it very boring and the story line is basically what people go through in their lives. Someone close to you dies and you move on I would not recommend this book to you basically because it is a played out storyline and I do not think the author spent too much time on this book which I think was probably thought of in ten minutes and written in twenty minutes and published. I mean come on dying from a bee sting I find that more comical than sad in my eyes 
 How does one write a book on city planning and not include a single illustation 
 Wal-Mart has become a controversial company because it has grown immensely powerful - by revenue the biggest company in the world and the largest private employer.  From its origins as a southern mid-western company going for neglected rural markets, its story is one of remarkable success.    This book offers a succinct history and some explanation of how Wal-Mart succeeded:  it went to markets that its big competitors ignored, made everyday low prices an essential part of its brand image, cultivated a conscientious service mentality in workers, and pursued efficiency through both scale and operations.  That is its business model in a nutshell.  Slater presents this matter of factly, as a natural evolution that carried the seeds of genius in the personality of earthy founder Sam Walton.  The bulk of the story is how Walton's successors expanded the company far beyond what the founder achieved, making it truly global and putting a bureaucratic system into place.  This was a bit useful for me as I start to investigate the company for a writing project.  Unfortunately, this book felt to me like Slater was happy to propogate the myth that Wal-Mart wishes observers to believe about the company.  He recounts how employees are taught to cheerlead, and acts like they want to, like they feel it sincerely rather than do it because they have to!  I can say that I found it hard to believe:  big companies are rarely happy and enthusiastic places.  Is that conclusion surprising to anyone?  It would be for Slater, who himself is a cheerleader.  Even worse, he only perfunctorily asks himself any of the hard questions - such as the company's treatment of labor, its transforming impact on local communities, its use of sweatshops, etc. etc. - and then quickly implies that they are largely superfluous or silly exaggerations.  This is nothing short of a simple white wash, and reads like PR that is trying to pose as thoughtful.  This is really mediocre and shallow, almost like a company brochure.  Slater failed to get inside the company, though he did do some interviews with prepped top officials, or so it appeared to me.  Oddly, as a relatively conservative business writer, I would give Wal-Mart the benefit of the doubt, pending my own investigation as a reporter.  But Slater seems to be openly endorsing the company as if it lived up to its own PR.  It is appalling to me, and I am no leftie or automatic critic of big companies, but I am a skeptic as a reporter.    Indeed, where he did address issues, they were never detailed enough, but instead were the most simplistic and narrow-minded generalizations.  For example, he writes:  "A new attitude was beginning to surface...Rather than show disdain for the negativism, the feeling was growing that there was virtue in having the media and community activists monitoring Wal-Mart."   That pap is emblematic of the tone of this book and perfectly reflects how superficial it is.  It also flatly contradicts what I have heard through the corporate grapevine with only the most simple of inquiries among my contacts.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book.  Reading it is like getting a huge vanilla milkshake for dinner rather than a steak.  I will have to look elsewhere for more balanced treatments of the many thorny issues that this huge company has helped to create 
 Don't be fooled by the cover. I bought this movie because I am a fan of Ong-Bak and The Protector. As soon as the movie started I was dissappointed. The voice-overs were absolutely horrendous and the captions would not even come close to what you actually heard. But still,I thought, it has Tony Jaa in it so the fighting will probably be good.!!Wrong!! In one of the reviews it says that Tony Jaa was at the end. I never even saw him at any point in the entire movie. As a matter of fact, the pictures on the packaging are from Ong-Bak. On the inside casing it has a picture of Jaa's mentor Rittikrai and on the opposite side it has a picture of him again with Jaa's head pasted on. You can tell because they're wearing the same jacket. A jacket that Rittikrai is the only one to wear in the movie.Tony Jaa's name never even appears in the credits. Unless you like to buy things that are an absolute lie,stay very far away from this product. Hopefully the companies that have been fooled into selling this product become aware of it and seek retribution on the people who fabricated this scam 
 I personally feel that the  the book is small, being rightly meant to be carried by residents in wards, but cramped with borrowed information which exceeds the capacity of the book. A lot of it feature in other standard texts and nothing is new.The algorithms too are borrowed. Information on antibiotic usage and common tropical disorders in detail are lacking. Unnecessary publicity is being given to the book and The Osler Medical Handbook by Cheng and Zaas is far superior to this in all aspects. Another important aspect is that students reading the book do not read standard texts and are clearly at a disadvantage while appearing in examinations.The book needs to be rewritten in another format to be successful.

 This book suffered from the same things the movie did--namely, a lack of action.  The book even left out some of the major parts, like a great deal of the space-based assault on the second Death Star, and instead concentrated on intangible elements like the Force.  Don't get me wrong--I like the Force--it's just that it does not lend itself to description in a book 
 this is a crass emotional manipultion..all be it well produced manipulation that gives the viewer a warm fuzzy feeling while very slyly promoting war..suggesting war is a duty to your country or what have you. At the same time manipulting the viewers emotions very very effectively.  War is mass indescriminate death of fooled young men and innocent civilians directed by millionaires who's prime purpose is to profit from the killing.   Think for a minute about what you're being told behind this mass of emotional manipulation 
 This book is often rude and self-indulgent.  I don't want my kids reading about humiliating opponenents, especially when the grammar is bad: "Victory for the team and I; humiliation for you."  I don't care for the self-congratulatory tone: "I remember challenging the star of the freshman team and beating him in one-on-one."  And the list of street court "excuses" seems lazy when half involve something wrong with the player's shoes.  My wife hates this book.  But my basketball-obsessed 20 month old likes the pictures (and he's too young to pick up on the obnoxiousness).  Thankfully, my four year old isn't interested 
  I did not like this film, surprising to me because I have liked all the other films in which Daniel Craig appeared, after I saw him for the for the first time in Casino Rayale. Also, the copy of the film which I bought used hat many black spots in it, a first for any used products I have ordered from Amazon 
 This book be a load o bull****. First off if you sleep with men and you a man, your a fa****, and thats all there is to it. And if your a fa**** with a woman, have some decency and respect, to let her know and get the he11 out of her life, instead of commitin murder by killing her with aids. And on another note; I dont know if its just me, but it seems like the author trying to say the only down low f***s is black guys, so I guess he's never been to the village on west 4th in NY city. 
 I bought the book thinking that it would be accurate and helpful in everyday conversation.   I feel that most of what I read is simply not factual.  As a person, I feel strongly that I would not want to tell anyone that I knew the author or was his friend.  maybe it is just that we come from different backgrounds and experience.  
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 I recently bought this book at a book store near me to try and teach myself how to draw.  I must say I was very disapointed with the text. There is more content in this "drawing" book, it seems, concerning ancient histories and theories than about drawing. If I wanted a history lesson I would buy a book by a qualified historian! Do yourself a favor and buy another book 
 My daughter was thrilled to get this for christmas with the rest of the set for the Little mommy doll.It came out of the box with easy basic instructions to put it together.BUT once it was put together my daughter went to put her doll in and it fell apart.Not the whole thing but the arm that holds the swing onto the base keeps falling off.My friends does the same nthing. Very cheaply made.Was not impressed at all. 
 I ordered this book having loved some other for dummies books.  Thank goodness I ordered several other saltwater tank books.  As I was picking through each of them I noticed that the for Dummies book contained information that completely contradicted the others!  I was so angry at the wrong information in this book that I sent it back at a $5.00 loss.  I'm actually considering checking some of my other for dummies books for errors.  Yes, the language is simpler than in other books, but the amount of wrong information is not worth the cost of the book.  Buy this if you want to kill some fish 
 This has been a very absorbing read, very detailed, chronologically ordered account of each sector of this war. Each battle is described right down to almost every single trench fight, while constantly invoking the strategic aim behind the battles.  However, at a soldier's level, this at best is an account of how the British saw the war. How the British felt about the war, and how the British saw other Allies and Enemies seeing the war. While there is enormous amount of coverage of British soldiers' record of letter-writing, diaries and poem-writing (there must be a hundred poems in the book - it seemed like every soldier was a poet at heart), there is not a single mention of any feelings of any other soldier who took part in the war. You want to know what the ordinary German soldier was thinking? Or even Britain's allied French, and American soldiers? You get an acount of what the British thought they were thinking. That's it! And its not for the lack of existence of any record. Its simply that the only research done was from British sources. The only account of any other country taking part in the war, has been of leaders, so you'll find some statements from the Kaiser of Germany, some generals in the French army, Adolf Hitler's letters to his landlord, etc, but no mention of any ordinary soldiers. It was refreshing to read at one point an account of a British soldier writing in his diary how a few German soldiers on the opposite side of the trenches at the frontline let it be known that they too were sick of the war. It finally gave a human face to the "German Soldier". It would have been great to know what a lot of these soldiers were actually writing in letters to their mothers, and what's recorded in the official German history of the war. But there's nothing there. Not for Germans, or the Austrians, or the Turks, and not even for the Allies.  And now for the truly disappointing part: Germans were "cruel" to use poisonous gases. British were forced to use the same gases, such had become the deterioration in mindset caused by the war. Turks and Austrians "butchered" the soldiers, while the naval blockade by British Navy of Germany causing over 80,000 civilians in Germany to die of starvation is mentioned as a matter of fact. Account of Turks handling the British POWs is deeply humanized from the prisoners' letters and poems, talking about the cruelty, but nothing is mentioned of any of the millions other prisoners that any other country possessed.  Churchill was as big a colonist as any other of his time. This is completely over-looked by the British historians, as if this wasn't really a bad thing. It flies in the face of what leaders on the opposite side were trying to do. So while the annexation of Belgium and Serbia and Poland are accounts mentioned in terms that a reader should find disturbing, British proposal of breaking up the Ottomon Empire, handing Syria, Palestine, Baghdad, Basra, Beirut etc to other countries as incentive to join the war should simply be read as military strategy.   If the wording had been the same for annexation of land and killing of people, this book could have been qualified as an impartial history of the First World War. 
 doom comes out fresh with lyrical skills but the production suck's i'm just being honest. but it's not doom's fault it's the people that produced it, anyways i reccomend thet u listen yo it first before buying it 
 Unfocused, repetitive, and worst of all - boring!  What should have been a slam dunk documentary about one of the worst blights on the modern age of politics instead turns out to be a damn shame.  Ronnie Earle, the district attorney at the center of the film, says,  "This isn't about Democrats and Republicans, this is about cops and robbers." If only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say. Instead, from the start, The Big Buy feels like a film you've walked into thirty minutes late. Following the theme stated by Earle of cops and robbers, The Big Buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic, but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely won't notice. Somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story, to bad it's not being told here.  
 Thought I was actually going to see a sequel to the original movie.  Instead It looked like a cut up version of a tv series.  Not much action and story was confusing because too many pieces were cut out 
 I have a 3.2 ghz, 2 GB, PC, clearly ready for Vista.  After running the compatibility wizard and uninstalling all the software that would conflict (even the optional conflicts the second time around), they told me it would install, yet, it didn't.  After an hour of installing, it tells me the installation fails and restores XP.  I realise that mine is an isolated case, but it's typical Microsoft.  If you want something that works, buy a Mac 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I've been a user of quicken for at least ten years. I've liked the product historically, but this version is garbage. Like other users, I too have fallen victim to the 'out of memory' error. Guess what? There's nothing I can do. I can't go back to a previous version of Quicken, because my data file isn't compatable.   Honestly, I blame myself for not reading the feedback others had left first. I was brand loyal to Intuit, but now I'm paying the price. The software is garbage, stay away. 
 Soulless is a personal attack on Ann Coulter, The cover shows how un-original liberals are, it's supposed to be her dressed as Ann. It looks more like a cross between Ann and Meatloaf.  If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. That's apparently the mantra of liberal authors who can't stop Ann Coulter's popularity on TV and in the book world.   Ann Coulter is brutally honest. At times honesty proves to be most unkind. But that's just the way it is. Sometimes Ann Coulter treats the liberal left as they have treated her, and they don't like it. But I can't recall anytime where she was hateful as Estrich has been. As far as her detractors calling her brainless, well, just consider the ignorance of the  source.    Susan Estrich's Dumb Ann Coulter Attacks are "WITLESS 
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
 My mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into Christianity.   I tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible. It was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book. In my personal opinion, the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on many occasions, this seems to be his only method of proving that the "Bible Code" does in fact, exist.   Not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in God or prophecies.' This gets very tiring. Drosnin does not provide solid evidence, no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms. The author kills his credibility on repeated occasions.   Overall, I found this to be an interesting read, but the author's arguements were not convincing enough for me. 
 The sewing machine, is built very cheaply, does not even sew correctly, I understand i didnot pay that much, but to feel you really are just ripping people off,its an item i ended up throwing out, for it just took up space 
 I wanted to read something "light" but the characters were too simplistic and lacked depth. The story was predictable and the plot presentaton was choppy.  Comparing this book to others where, I believe, friendships were the main theme, this book lacked substance 
 It is very important to me as a serious artist to be able to understand thru detail of how am image is painted. Why buy and spend the money for a book unless it is completely useful. I can look at pictures all day and try to figure out how to paint it but if I buy a book to show me, I expect to learn a lot 
 Like several of the more positive reviewers, I'm a lifelong Toto fan.  And I did all I could to try to get into this album, but I just never could.  Yes, there are a couple of good songs - "Angel Don't Cry" is a pretty good rocker, I love "How Does It Feel" and "Holyanna" is a good closing song.  But for the most part, the band just didn't deliver an album that could stand up to the body of his previous albums.  It's not the style that was weak - the songwriting just seemed to be lacking on this one.  I would likely give this album 3 stars for almost any other artist...but Toto was capable of a lot more than this. 
 After 2 attempts at having this shipped to me, and both times having it arrive broken.  I have given up this model.  It's a shame that the poor packaging on the machine is the reason for the rowers rating.  If you can buy one at the store, it may be a great unit, but don't let it go UPS 
 I thought that Preacher's boy had an intresting first couple chapters but after that i started to notice it got boring.  i think there should be more of a plot in the book.  it is basically about 2 boys named robbie and willie who pull pranks and get in trouble. After Robbie meats Zeb and Vile it gets a little better but I still think it could of been a little more well-written 
 Hello Animal fans..... I work for an Oldies station and bought this Raven C.D. for one reason. The song, "We gotta get out of this place" has not been available in original mono since the Animals Greatest Hits L.P. was released many years ago so I paid the $17.99 expecting to get the original reocording and what I recieved is the same ALTERNATE TAKE as available everywhere.....I cannot understand why Raven did not choose to utilize the original recording as it appears they obtained the other Animal hits from the same source as the older L.P..(all mono recordings) with the exception of "Don't bring me down" which has always been available in stereo, the later hits are a fine mix..... I am returning my Raven C.D. RVCD-178 to Amazon for a full refund. I hope someday someone, somewhere will release the original recording of "We Gotta Get Out of this place" and not this same alternate recording in which Eric Burdon sometimes sings out of tune. Sincerly, Pat Maestro KXO Radio El Centro, Californi 
 Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious.  Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book.  I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was "forced" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug.  This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't.   I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so.  Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any.    
 _Dog Love_ reads like a dry PhD dissertation; as a former college instructor, I can appreciate the research involved in this text.  That said, the chapter entitled "Sex and the Single Dog" contained a  litany of references to bestiality in literature.  My concerns are for  readers, especially the young and their guardians, who expect to read  stories of inspiration but are instead inducted into a perverse  exploitation of dogs.  Kudos to Amazon.com for warning readers through  reviews such as this [unlike one of your competitors who has now lost my  business] 
 I was initially impressed by the topics to be covered in this book however found that few areas were well discussed.  Whilst myself exploring the differences between modern psychology and Nouthetic counseling, this book failed to completely discuss the areas detailed in its contents.  I was particularly disappopinted with the chapter "The myth of intergration" which had very little to do with intergrating modern psychology with Biblical concepts.  Examples were biased and information appeared to be delievered without the thoroughness that such texts require for today's critical minds.  As this review is titled, I believe the author had good intentions, however with exposure to Jay Adams and the like for his work, this book offers very little useful information.  
 According to the authors, Gulangyu Islet is supposedly the "Piano Island" but no one seems to have told the locals?  Did they talk to the locals?  I'ved lived here for 18 years, and Gulangyu is known not only throughout China but Asia as well for its pianos (1 in every 5 families has one) and the largest piano museum in Asia.  Locals are proud of this--so where did the "no one seems to have told the locals? come from?     I'm used to the sarcasm of jaded travelers and their jaded guides, but this bunch reminds me of the fictitious author of the hilarious fictitious guidebook to the Asian country "Phaic Tan" who said, "I visit every place twice--the first time to experience it and the second time to complain about the changes."     Another group of so-called experts wrote about Xiamen's Xinjie Church in a beautiful pictorial on Western Religious Architecture in China, but though the photos were incomparable, I could tell they were like the Frommer's bunch, and had not done their homework.  They said the Xinjie Church folk were arrogant because they had a plaque in front boasting they were China's most important church. If the authors knew any Chinese, or history, they'd have known the plaque said they were China's 1st (earliest) Protestant Church, not the most important.      That brings me, in closing, to Frommer's comment on my own books, like Amoy Magic, in which they admitted had information not found elsewhere but would probably be chucked out the window because of their amateurish, inane attempts at humor.        Granted, I'm not an expert travel writer, but I do know the place, and I wrote them because I was tired of guidebooks written by people like these who bus into town, spend two days jotting notes, take off, and then write misleading information about our city and province.  (I just had a man from another famous travel guide visit, spend one day on Gulangyu, interview me briefly, and then write the "guide" to Gulangyu and Xiamen--but this guy was smart enough to ask locals (Chinese and foreign) for help, in spite of his tight schedule.     China is too big a country for any one team to take in, so I understand a teams' limitations--but this group is a bit much.  Why not just write about what they do know and leave out the unprofessional political and personal diatribes?       In closing, I'm not a pro at writing guidebooks (though I've received hundreds of letters from people who do like my "inane" humor), but I am a pro at reading them.  I've been in Asia over 20 years, and based on my experience, if I wanted a guide to China I'd go with Lonely Planet or Fodor's, because Frommer was Fumbling when they put together their latest "team."       P.S. I just found Frommer's online description of Xiamen: "Much of the island is a hideous white-tiled wasteland to match anything else in China, but even so, the odd turret and spire reflect the city's pride in its stock of original European architecture."      I would have liked to give Frommer's at least 2 stars just for the quantity of info--but the info is too misleading.  This "hideous white-tiled wasteland" is in fact one of China's most beautiful cities, loved by foreign and Chinese residents alike (even awarded the Habitat award by the U.N. and received the Gold in the international Livcom competition).  There is so much good they good have written about.. 
   I do not hate Ann Coulter but I do dislike her! In this anthology of articles on the likes of Ms. Coulter; Rush Limbaugh;Bill O'Reilly; Sean Hannity; Michael Savage and the stars of Fox TV, Regency Books and George Wills we see the dark side of these neo-conservative media darlings.   The book contains several articles that are years old. The book is thin on biographical information on the persons who are chronicled and is written by several liberal critics of the radio/TV wars in the age of George W. Bush.   I did learn some facts on these folks I did not know but was somewhat disappointed in this poorly printed on cheap paper paperback 
 Book is out of date with modern economic thought.  Essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets. 
 I try to read items that I would not necessarily agree with. However, this piece of doggerel is nothing but exagerrations, misquotes, and spin. She uses tacky research to make points that don't exist, then brushes off any critique as "liberal bias". If you are a conservative, please read something that will allow us to discuss matters. Coulters' book should be titled "Slander: Liberal Lies I Made Up. 
 This article is a reprint of a 1913 magazine piece written by Joshua L. Chamberlain to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Gettysburg.  While it's interesting to read his first hand depiction of the battle, all readers should note the story is approximately 15 pages long.  The publishers have tried to beef up the "book" by adding 15 additional pages of photos, but it does not make up for the lack of content.  I was very disappointed with the purchase 
 This movie is not offensive- at least not in the way the producers want it to be.  Most of us have an "anything goes" attitude towards entertainment these days, and accordingly, broadcasting something as "OFFENSIVE!" has just become a tired combination of marketing device and transparent attempt to appear a First Amendment champion.  Continued use of profanity and bathroom humor isn't all that funny if you're older than 13- it's initially kind of amusing, then puerile, then pathetic.  Comics tend to be attention-starved anyway, and therefore take any joke further and longer than you or I would care to see.  Case in point: The Aristocrats.    That aside, I wanted to like this movie.  I loved the premise, that telling a joke is like jazz, in that plenty of artists repeat the same material, but with their own interpretation.  It's the singer (comedian) that resonates, not the song (joke).  However, this film is a one trick pony that long outlives its clever foundation.  I also had a hard time believing that these guys found the joke all that funny themselves; most of the onscreen laughs were due to the chemistry between these old friends, and the audience isn't really a part of the joke a lot of the time.   The film's novelties provide the most entertaining moments: Kevin Pollack's Christopher Walken imitation, Billy the Mime, Taylor Negron's gay rendition, and a magician who tells the joke via a card trick.  George Carlin was really the only comic who made me laugh with his version of a strict telling of the joke.  On top of everything else, I found the jarring, MTV-style editing and quick camera switches made The Aristocrats even tougher to watch.     While we're on the subject, is there anyone worse than Bob Saget?  He can swear as much as he wants, and he's still every bit as annoying and unfunny as when he hosted America's Funniest Videos.  Impossibly, he's even less funny when profane.  
 I should have paid attention to the other reviews, but I really wanted to give my niece a bank like this so I bought it anyway. Didn't work at all. We changed batteries, jiggled everything that could be jiggled, but still no luck. Too bad, because it's a very cute bank with bright colors; perfect for a little girl. If only it actually worked. Hey, is it possible we all received and returned the same item? Maybe someone should mark the box 
 I was disappointed in this book/tape.  I thought it would give me some real insights into life and spirituality, as alot of good books have.  But this was just nausiatingly gay, hopelessly drippy, and not insightful at all.  I didn't want anyone to read poetry to me or ask me to notice what a peach looks like.  I wanted something different.  I give it two stars because I know other people liked it, and others may find it nice to read/listen to 
 This is a great book for those who want to only "play around the edges" of the Paschal Mystery of Jesus Christ and mistake a Hollywood blockbuster for authentic catechesis.  If you simply want to "understand" the film without having to do the hard work of actually thinking about it, then this is the book for you.  Filled with circular reasoning and inconsistent proof-texting, this book is a deceptive promotional tool that does not represent official Church teaching on the meaning and proper interpretation of the Passion story. The overwhelmingly predictable questions are set up for trite, facile answers.  It will comfort and excite you if all you want is to be confirmed in your love of this troubled, troublesome film and of Gibson's own idiosyncratic Catholicism.  But if you have real questions about the REAL thing, look elsewhere.  For starters, try "The Bible, the Jews and the Death of Jesus," for a more sober and grounded look at how Catholics are to approach this precious story of our salvation.  Yes, I am a Catholic.  I had an intensely ambivalent response to the film, neither loving nor hating it and being moved by many moments in it.  But I have been deeply saddened by so much of the hoo-ha and hype surrounding it, especially the self-serving attitude of Christians, especially Catholics, who claim to love the teachings of the Church yet who make no attempt to find out what those teachings actually are (teachings which Mel Gibson categorically rejects), and who are often quite vicious in their response to other believers who raise serious questions about what Gibson is showing us.  The film is a late-medieval Passion play that benefits from skillful direction and modern special effects.  It is not "THE" teaching of the Church, but a high-quality work of devotional fiction.  No problem with that!  But let's call a spade a spade, shall we?  How is Christ honored by the disingenuousness of the maxed-out defense of this film?  Love the film; hate the film; be indifferent to it.  But do not mistake it for what it is not, even when it seems that your case can be "proven" by things like this shallow, misleading book.  
 Maybe my expectations were too high due to the hype surrounding these products.  However, this shampoo did not work for me.  Like the previous reviewer said, it was watery and did not lather at all.  It also made my hair feel stripped and left it very hard.  I followed up with a hair smoothie, but a large amount of my hair broke off due to how dry and unmanageable the product left my hair.  I do not recommend this at all 
  I used this book for the first and last time in Autumn term 2006 with 28 foreign students in my Global Finance MBA course.  When one wishes to make money by consistently reissuing new editions he has an obligation to update it at least minimally, (The Paul Samuelson Rule). In this case Greed is not good.  Hence, my exasperation when I open the 2006 edition of the book and on the first page learn that the currency of Belgium is the Belgian franc,  the currency of Ireland is the pound,(Ireland's curency was never the pound; it was the punt) or that Germany still has the DM. Many of students lost points on a midterm because they thought the currency of Finland is is the markka. Shapiro in 2006 says so. On the next page he fails to mention Monaco; there are a lot of capital flows internationally through Monoco. And on that page Spain still has a peseta.Portugal has escudos.  The book also suffers from wordiness. I did like the key phrases section in each chapter; I thought at least that all key phrases would be included in the glossary but I could find all there. There is a certain obtuseness which I did find perplexed my students sometimes, who did not quite enjoy this book as I had hoped. We would not use it again.  I tried to contact the author by email with several queries but did not experience the courtesy of a reply 
 DENNIS LEARY IS HAILED AS SOME GREAT ANGRY YOUNG MAN WHO IS TRYING TO BRING THE WORLD TO RIGHTS. PERSONALLY I PREFER BILL HICKS. AT LEAST WHEN BILL DID IT HE WAS BEING ORIGINAL!!!!!!! DENNIS LEARY HAS IN MY OPINION NICKED BILL HICKS ACT IN A SIMILAR WAY TO HOW I FEEL ABOUT JOSS STONE COMPARED TO PROPER SOUL ARTISTS. SITTING IN FRONT OF A FEW LIVE VIDEOS OF A GREAT MAN AND TAKING NOTES DOES NOT MEAN YOU WILL EVER BE ONE DENNIS! DEFINATELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS COVERS BANDS...STICK TO THE ACTING DENNIS 
 Said's book has, sadly, been hugely influential on thousands of university students, their professors, and many living in the islamic world.  His book should not be read without concurrently reading Ibn Warraq's critique _Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism_.  Said lays the blame for nearly everything wrong in the islamic world  at the feet of the West, and thus helped entrench the culture of victimhood that feeds into suicide bombings and riots against political cartoons.  By authorin this book, Said confirmed his place in History as an irresponsible poseur in scholarly trappings 
 This soap washed really well, but after I rinsed it off, it felt like my skin had a soapy film over it. It also made my skin feel "stipped". I did not really like this soap and instead recommend Basis facial products instead 
 I bought this crock-pot a year ago because I commute an hour to the school I teach at and end up exhausted by the time I get home...with grading to do as well.  I had to find a way to get meals prepared with minimal muss and fuss and needed an occasional break from microwave meals.  A slow cooker seemed ideal.   This model seemed to fit the bill:  large capacity, convenient oval shape to hold larger items like roasts, and an affordable price, but I guess you do get what you pay for.  Maybe my particular slow cooker was defective.  I'll never know since the 30 day return window expired by the time I noticed the problem, but this unit puts out too much heat.  Even on the low setting, I'd come home to food with a decidedly burnt taste to them.  At first I thought that the recommended 8 hours on low for most recipes might be too long, so then I started using it only on weekends when I could cut the cooking time down.  That didn't work either.  Even on the low setting, the food would come to a boil around the edges and that horrid burnt taste would permeate the entire meal.  I'd also find that the edges, and sometimes the bottom, would have food stick and burn, leaving a crusty black residue that had to soak overnight before being taken off.  Also, I never felt comfortable leaving it on all day because the bottom of the unit became very hot as well.  Now it sits in my closet in my classroom.  Every now and then I'll pull it out to boil hotdogs for in-class celebrations, so it's not a total waste of money...but I'd definitely not recommend this unit for anyone else, based on my experience with it 
 depressing as each chapter starts with a final illness segment.  Without that it would have been a MUCH better and more enjoyable book.  It may have been cathartic and healing for Chris, but not so for me 
 You sent it to the wrong address. I never recieved it.. I spent hours and hours trying to get the address corected.. Then I spent hours and days trying to cancell the order.. Your customer service rates a D- !!! to say the least. finally I got a credit for the Item. But you wouldn't give me credit for the shipping!!  I was RIPPED OFF. 
 This "magazine" is comprised of basically 90% of computer generated pictures, they have about 2 original ideas(not that great) and the rest of the ideas are recycled over and over in the whole book.  I have only gone through the book once and the way it was contructed the pages are falling out.  I wouldn't even donate this book to a library.  Please don't waste you money, there are so many other great books.  Good Luck 
 Ads for this sweeper are very misleading.  I've used it 3 times and each time it has only picked up some dog hair and nothing else.  It will never pick up: Tiny pieces of thread, paper, leaves, dirt, etc and these were all very tiny pieces.  You can roll the thing back and forth over these items 20 times and all it does is move them an inch or two, never pick up. The amount of time it takes to use the tiny comb they provide to clean the roller brush takes longer than getting out the vacuum to do the job over.  The handle comes in several pieces and even when assembled as instructed the handle will not stay together. It constantly falls apart and has to be put back together.  You can get around this at least by using duct tape.  Unless you have a very low pile carpet or berber, and the ONLY thing you ever have to pick up is pet hair, this Bissell product is a total waste of mone 
  This pan is Small.  I have a gas range with heavy grates, and this pan was hard to get it to fit even, it kept falling through the grates till I could just get it right!(took some time)   It came with a very good recipe, but to me this was such a pain in the neck to make these, I just took out my big double Calphalon Griddle and made pancakes, which turned out great, and tasted the same as Aebleskivers  When I did make Aebleskivers and put the jam in the middle , it seemed to disapeared and I had a hole where the jam was!! I then used fresh apples, that worked out better, but I still like pancakes, allot easier to make 
 The shoes are made from very good leather material wich is pretty light in weight considering the style.  However, they are not the most comfortable shoes.  They pinch the toes and I spent a lot of time with them unbuckled so that I could ease my foot out of them.  I wear a nine and these were a nine medium.  At one point during the day I wondered if I had on a six and took them off to check.  I wondered if I had bought a nine & a half if I would have gotten a better fit. What I found odd is that when I fitted them on their arrival they were fine it is the continuous wearing that revealed the discomfiture 
 I got it just today and used it for cleaning my lens. The solution might be useful, the blower is useful, the swabs can be useful with their pointed tips, but the so called "magic cloth" is anything but magic. It kept leaving lint on my lens 
 This was my first Robert Ludlum novel and I am seriously disappointed. I don't know that I'll even finish it.  Characters have literally had the same conversations multiple times, as if the author isnt sure we were paying attention and they better summarize the plot again, just to be safe.  The writing itself just tries to hard and is, in a word, lame.  Sample line: "He crossed the room to the sink and picked up the dish liquid, Dawn, and poured some in the sink." Like we need to what brand of dish soap it is(!)?    From the summary on the jacket, this novel sounded promising. Instead, I'm fighting to stay awake, not caring if they ever catch the bad guys. 2 out 5 stars because I've managed to hang on more than half way. 
 Mike Jones isn't anything different. Still Tippin is talking about what every other rapper has already covered. Who cares if your "tippin" on 4 4s? All the other songs are just basic rap songs with no real meaning. Also, how many times does this guy need to say his name or give out his phone number? 
 I really thought, when I bought this LP, that this would be an improvement.  There is a keyboard mix on the first cut, but then Farner recycles one of his boring, repetitive guitar breaks and the record takes an artistic skid from there.  I notice the CD has a live version of "I'm Your Captain."  This is one of the band's better tunes, having been played ad nauseum on your favorite album rock station.  But the instrumentation is stretched out sans improvisation and it all gets tired.  That a new generation even thinks this band is worth anything must be a sad commentary on the state of modern rock and pop music.  Footnote:  The LP jacket was ROUND and shaped like a huge coin.  I'ts corny, but far catchier than the insipid music found inside 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 Can you say P A I N? This is what Steve Madden shoes are. Pain. The soles must be made of cast iron. The upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough. I am convinced that this Madden person HATES WOMEN. If it were in my power, I would track down Steve Madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs, Only Standing, Walking and .....Dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain. 
 There is not enough cheese and crackers in this world to go along with the "whine" that Ms. Lamott serves up in Plan B.  I have loved her previous works and based on their merit, I pushed on into this book, beginning each new chapter with hope and ending in dissappointment until I finally had to toss it into the garbage.  It was tedious, from menopausal maladies to blaming George Bush for all the problems in her life.  And God Himself, or "Herself", as Ms. Lamott would say, seems to be a reflection of who SHE is and not the other way around.  Yes, God loves us just the way we are but He also loves us too much to leave us that way...except in her case apparently.  I wanted to like it and I am sorry to say that it fell way below my expectations.  Bummer 
 Author devotes 2 pages to mathematically prove & philosophically justify that a manager should chose the highest NPV project before chosing the next highest NPV project.  Such logic continues ad infinitum throughout the 800+ page text.  Time for 3rd Ed 
 I bought this product because it combined a number of security elements.  It worked fine until I installed the network security feature.  We have a home network and as soon as I installed the product, the other computers were unable to access the internet.  When I tried to uninstall it, my computer lost internet access.  Even using the 26 digit key did not allow access.  Customer service was useless.  They gave me directions which involved changing the registry. Bad move.  Needless to say, I had to have a computer repair service fix the network, and I had to reformat my hard drive. McAfee assumed no responsibility for the problems it caused,  Dell was nice enought to walk me through the reformat and it wasnt even their product that caused the problems.  I would like to give this no stars 
 I am not sure why my school chose this book/ Author. I have yet to meet anyone who enjoys using this book. I give it 2 stars only because it has all the NANDA dx in it (if you can find them!)I find it very time consuming. If you enjoy flipping back and forth to several pages without much help in finding what you are looking for, then this is the book for you. Index aside, this book needs to be more user friendly. I simply do not like the way it is organized. Risk Factors are seperate from Nursing DX, but stuck in the middle of the book, good luck following from one section to another! There is no friendly flow in this book to use it efficiently. Sorry, but I can't recommend this book. There has got to be a better way to write this book 
 I like Math, Not circler illogic.  Took this course in 1997; while my professor was initially excited since he had known Lay, he soon simply shook his head in disgust, and said he needs to talk to his old friend 
 I decided that I had to write a review about Newsweek this morning, after I came across yet another biased, over-hyped cover story. This particular one is entitled, "Rethinking the Marriage Crunch," and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman's chances of getting married later in life. This was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around, and neglected to have any on this occasion. I really think another reviewer's comparison to People is quite apt, but Newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue. Two years ago, we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning "Infidelity Chic." Yes, it seems, according to their sources, spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue, without even a hint of contradiction, that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before. I find the magazine to be [...] as they offer opinion instead of news; theirs is a mission of persuasion. Overall, there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool. 
 Let me start by stating that im a 24 year old university educated individual.  This book was thrusted into my face and forced into my brain when i was in forth grade.  It was by far the most driest and boring book i've ever read at that point in my life...and continue to be so until college.  Now, i dont remember anything at all about this book other than the fact it was about some boy writing letters to some man; but the fact that i dont remember anything gives you an idea at how little i stimulted.  Till this day, im reluctant to even bother to re-read this book and give it another chance.  I've been scarred for life.  I have no doubt that this books contains a lot of substance and insightful tales, but the thought of reading some poor pathetic boy's letters causes me to shriver.  If i would have to chose any book of my childhood that discouraged me from reading more, it would have to be this.  PLease spare your child/student from the tortures of this book.  Maybe once they've grown mentally and have the capacity and patience to understand it, it would be a great book.  But at such a young age, its a horrible read.  I noticed that this book recieved some high marks from young readers; for some reason i feel that those ratings may be incorrect and the young children's opinions may have been "clouded".  Do you teacher's know no shame?  
 i bought this crane for a 5 yrs old boy for xmas, but i think i will return it.  there is a knob that you twist that raises and lowers the crane.  well it does raise the crane, but does not lower it.  there is not enough tension/weight to the hook part for this to work. what i had to do is turn the knob a few times and then pull the crane hook thing out manually, and even this did not work too well.  i think a kid could indeed figure out how to do something with this toy, but can't reccomend it 
 This movie is almost like Evil Dead meets Ever After and Van Helsing, while Sleep Hollow provides the backdrop.  This movie is like a mainstream B movie.  There were times I found myself laughing out loud at how cheesy or genuinely funny the movie was.   I would say Matt Damon and Heath Ledger didn't do a bad job acting, however both of their performances aren't anything to get excited about either.  It is worth watching this movie just to see some of the set design and SOME of the special effects. But there are other movies in this department that deliver in a much better fashion.  I don't think this movie did very well in the box office and I think I have a theory.  This movie was promoted with a PG-13 rating, which means anyone who is over 13 or with someone as old as 13 can see this movie.  Well some of the graphic violence in this movie was crazy.  I can see a parent not wanting their under 13 year old to see this violence, and an adult might wanting more graphic violence.   I don't know, I felt this movie was pretty brutal for a "light-hearted fantasy adventure".  Come on man, let's be honest with the viewers of America, this movie was morbid.  I can list some moments:   1) A man is shot in the back of the neck and there is plenty of blood 2) A child looses his eyeballs via mud 3) Spider webs come out of a horses' mouth and eat a child  4) A woman's face cracks and the decay of death is reveled under her skin 5) A man is lanced with a broken flag pole 6) Several decapitated heads 7) A kitten is killed by a huge fan 8) Horses are lit on fire  Now the violence didn't bother me, a movie is a movie.  I just find it so interesting that there is such tightness around movie ratings.  For instance, the F bomb automatically makes a movie rated R.  However the former elements are put into a movie combined with a spooky-fantasy aspect and it is a family film.  Oh well I suppose this is why I never made it in the movie business.   
 I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through).  It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere.  I do not recommend this book 
 I bought this becuse it got a great review in the Village Voice and now seeing that the author lives in Brooklyn he must know the reviewer and got a gift from him.  Anyway I read close to a hundred pages hoping it would get better and reaized that it was a complete waste of my time 
 This is one of those thrown together soundtracks.All the cookie cutter,whoever is on the "popular music chart" crap music.There was only one cool song in the entire film and it's not even on the soundtrack.I hope the band sues.Don't waste your money on this garbage.There is nothing remotely interesting about anything on this soundtrack,but if you are a gullable sheep who doesn't mind being led to the slaughter,by all means buy the C.D,we need stupid consumers like you out there,you help the economy 
 I can't believe how you nice little English people can actually edit such terrible and unbelievable books!  I hope you'll never ever get another book published 
 Only 38 pages into this book, I've had to put it down in sheer awe of how utterly inaccurate this book is.   From the questions it suggests you ask a prospective pediatrician to the AAP's "neutral" view on circumcision, this book is obviously written in a very biased undertone.   Thankfully, I got this from the library. All I have to do is return it and try and forget the bad, bad information it provided.   Keep looking 
 Contextually, this book little more than a glorified PowerPoint presentation.  And substantively, it is chock full of glib, superficial advice freely given by someone who has no idea what she's talking about.  Karen Salmansohn totally blows it in her introduction when she reveals (or at least implies) that she has never personally experienced the combined joys and nightmares of pregnancy.  Guess what?  I'd find her advice on wearing a bikini a lot more useful if I knew that she personally had once weighed so much that she could fight as a Light Heavyweight 
 There are quite a few things that I did not like about this book. Luckily I borrowed it from my Spanish teacher in 8th grade and did not have to continue my life knowing that I wasted my money on a bad book.  Some people will tell you that learning vocabulary is the hardest thing in learning a language. This is most certainly false. With proper learning techniques learning vocabulary is not difficult at all; I did, however, feel that this book introduced far too many vocabulary words at one time.  The author attempts to retard the importance of the study of grammar while learning Latin. To be successful in your study of Latin, however, you must have a very _clear_ understanding of the language's grammar. The explanations in this book cause one to develop a very fuzzy understanding that is insufficient for clear thinking, reading, translation, and composition.  I highly recommend that you do not purchase this book and instead purchase Wheelock's Latin. I am going through that book right now, and everything is very clearly explained; the number of vocabulary items introduced in each lesson is perfect in my opinion -- not too much, not too little -- and I do not ever develop that "fuzzy" understanding that came from reading this book 
 It is truly sad that a scholar of the alleged caliber of James Robinson has so transparently rushed into print with such a volume.The whole tenor of his work smacks of bitterness that he was excluded from the detailed and meticulous restoration,translation and analysis of the recently discovered Gospel of Judas Iscariot that is so well described in Herb Krosney's "The Lost Gospel" (Published by National Geographic).  This work does him and his reputation no justice whatsoever and readers would be well advised to buy the National Geographic Volumes if they want to get the full story of this extraordinary find.  
 This insipid remake takes far too many liberties with the story, butchers its source material, and unsurprisingly ends up being quite a mess. Furthermore, the movie doesn't even really make sense when you think about it. The protagonist this time wants to travel to the past to save his love, and finds he can't alter what happened. He then goes to the future where he CAN alter events. The remake entirely forgets the point that the Eloi are supposed to be human cattle. That they're not kind of entirely destroys the whole point of the book, and the film greatly suffers as a result. The character played by Jeremy Irons was a dumb addition to the story. Ironically, the special effects used to depict the Morlocks were better in the 60s film 
 I had this as a text book for an organizational leadership class at the master's degree level. The material is repetitive in its chapter presentations, but the core elements are still good. I just didn't find it to be reader-friendly. For some reason the authors feel compelled to remind the reader every few paragraphs that the responses of more than "6,000 team members" form the basis of their conclusions. I understood that point based on the title and didn't need to be reminded on each page. The book reads as if someone went straight to print with their research paper, rather than making it an engaging read. By chapter 3 I no longer cared about the value of the content, I just hated the book. Seriously. You've been warned 
 I was hoping for a book with practical thoughts and techniques to help the reader navigate through the darker parts of life.  Instead this is a rambling essay that quotes pagan God's and assumes a level of knowledge that leaves the average reader wondering what the heck he is talking about.  I got tired of hearing about how we should embrace our dark side; and found the opinions that it's okay to invoke total lack of responsibilty for one's actions in pursuit of this darkness downright dangerous; (especially the chapter discussing women who wake up one day and no longer want to parent their children). It's no wonder his publisher released him as he states in one of his chapters.  His book is obviously meant to appeal to a very particular audience and is not for someone who wants to get out of a depression and longs to live in the light.  It's not at all what I expected from the book jacket and knowing that he is a former Catholic Monk!  I also found his writing style difficult to follow and more in the mode of a scholarly paper than a book meant to convey knowledge to a wide range of readers.  Only for those already into the occult and previously inoculated to this genre 
 This is one of my all time favourite movies so I was thrilled when I received it as a Christmas gift. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that this is a defective disc. It plays for a few minutes and jumps back to the start. This happened evrytime I tried to watch it. Other discs play without a problem on my DVD player so the fault lies definitely with this disc. I do not have the packaging or the packing slip which I did not keep as I did noy expect a product received from Amazon to be of this poor quality. I don't know how to return it to Amazon in the absence of the packing slip. Please help. Sincerely, Mandakini Tat 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 First off, let me just say that I LOVED the first three books. So when I learned that a fourth was to be released, I was thrilled. So when I got in and read it, I was really disappointed. A lot of the plot lines that Ann Brashares has been cultivating since book number 1 seemed to go out the window. It was almost as if she decided she didn't like them after all. Both Carmen and Lena had love interests at the end of the third book, yet neither is so much as mentioned. The third book made it seem like Lena had finally gotten over Kostos, and had moved on to Carmen's shy step-brother. Carmen meanwhile seemed quite happy with Win. Personally, I thought the character of Win was good for Carmen. In the fourth book, Carmen no longer even has Win, but she has turned into a shy, loner of sorts on the Williams college campus. My spring semester of college is just now ending, and I have to say that none of the girls' first years of college seemed accurate. No one could change as much as Carmen did in the first year. Bee finally has the man of her dreams, and it seems odd to me that she would forget Eric so fast and believe herself not to be in love with him anymore. Also, she never seemed to be the type to jet of to Turkey for a summer long dig. The dig also seemed unrealistic. From what I know of them, it takes a long time just to find one piece, yet they were finding whole skeletons and complete pieces of pottery. Not exactly realistic. Lena, the one character who I relate the most too, never would have posed nude for a fellow painter before. The character of Leo is almost to perfect, and not exactly believable. She also has reverted to dwelling on Kostos again. I thought she had gotten over him and had moved on to Paul. Kostos even makes an appearance in the book, in what is quite possibly the most bizarre scene I have ever read. I even had a bit of trouble understanding what was going on. The whole conclusion of her relationship with Leo was a bit sudden and unexpected as well. Now, on to Tibby. First of all, let me just say that I think it is way out of Brian's character to push sex with Tibby. I also think it is out of character for him to smuggle a bottle of wine into her dorm. While I do think he is the type of guy to visit her as often as he does, I still can't believe he rides a bus for 12 hours every weekend just to see her. It's understandable when Tibby freaks out over her pregnancy scare. However, I would have hoped she would have matured enough to not shut Brian out when he so obviously was trying to help her.  I could go on, but I won't. I will say that there were several nice scenes with Bridget, her father, and her brother Perry. Otherwise, I would recommend the just first three novels 
 This toy is so lame. The paper sheets that come with it are hard to keep on. The pegs fall out unless you use the papers, and then they still don't usually stay in. The pegs that come in a row(to save time) only fit diagonally, and stay in even worse than the single pegs. This toy is super lame and useless. Don't waste your money 
 Worst accessory ever! DON'T BUY IT. It doesn't have power to blow or vacuum a smallest piece of styrofoam or paper. It'just doesn't work, it looks nice, but is utterly loud and gets clogged in a second, I mean if you somehow manage to scratch some dust of your equipment 
 As tempted as I am to give this book 3 stars, 2 stars is closer to rating the whole.  First, this book is for the novice. If you're more than a little familiar with medieval European history, you'll find nothing new here except Cahill's sometimes quirky interpretations of people and events. For some, these interpretations alone will be enough to revisit Hildegard, Abelard, and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Those who've read full length biographies of the main "characters" or the Durants' Story of Civilization or even Freeman's Closing of the Western Mind may want to skip this volume.  The point of Cahill's Hinges of History series seems to be "if you think history isn't fun and relevant, think again." I have a soft spot for such ventures so Cahill starts out in the plus column with me. I enjoyed "How the Irish Saved Civilization" for what is was, pop history meant to whet but not satisfy the appetite. Approach this volume with that in mind and you will likely enjoy it. I found numerous points of disagreement with his "theories" - the rise of feminism, for instance, hardly began with Eleanor!  Unfortunately, Cahill goes off the rails in the introduction and in the conclusion. In the Intro Cahill praises Italy's anti-death penalty stance and then detours to tell us about his "friend" who was on Texas's death row for a crime "he probably didn't commit", was a great guy and was ultimately executed and isn't modern day America wrong wrong wrong about the death penalty. This left me asking two questions: 1) huh? and 2) why doesn't Cahill write a book and tell his friend's story instead of shoehorning it into the Middle Ages?  When Cahill rants about the pedophile scandals in the US Catholic Church while sadly ignoring similar scandals in Ireland and in the Anglican Church in Australia it feels like what it is - a rant, not a commentary on history or current events. When he then makes veiled comparisons between Philip the Fair of France - who is barely mentioned in the main text - and a certain American President (who he doesn't name so I guess I won't either), Cahill's take on Philip the Fair is so wrong-headed and lame, on top of being entirely unaddressed in the previous pages that I couldn't help feeling more than a little tricked. Again, why doesn't Cahill take his strongly held views about current events and write about them on their own? As it is, Cahill risks making the entire book look like a scam - he's not really interested in the Middle Ages, just scoring a few points. I don't believe that is the case but Cahill's antics damage his credibility even as a popular historian. Hence the 2 stars. I hope Cahill's editors exercise a bit more restraint for the next volume of Hinges 
 I can't believe amazon and Kensington are still selling this product.  I just bought mine last week, and when it wouldn't register, I got this email back from Kensington tech support.

 I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished.  It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.  Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading 
 Definitely for the absolute beginner who has never seen a bass upclose. Very little learning material. Could do with more indepth explanation. Would not recommend this one 
 Hope Edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. She has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. The second hole in Edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? I'll believe it when I see it. It's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. Within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that Edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant. Other than these two crucial holes, Edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. It's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own 
 It would be impossible for me to write you a review.  I never received the subject CD.  You sent me some piece of crap dics which I sent back.  I have not received the Gene Watson CD i ordered and paid for.  If I don't get it soon, you will never hear from me again.  Edward N Clark - Herrin, I 
 This film is pure c..p.  For many years, there has been explicit sex used in many mainstream European films.  It is no longer the novelty it once was.  There is a point where you don't care about the sex, and you just wonder whether the film is any good.  So, yes, there are explicit sex scenes here, but that's it.  If you like porn, I would actually recommend watching something different, because the filmmakers here are trying to make us think that this is an important film.  It isn't.  You're better off looking at porn.  Baise Moi (roughly translated means "rape me") looks cheap (shot on DV), and it's a poor man's Thelma and Louise, with some John Woo style shootouts thrown in.  The film isn't intelligent or innovative in the least.  It is actually incredibly boring and feels like a 3 hour film, despite the fact it's only 73 minutes long.  If you want to see intelligent, thoughtful filmmaking on sexual matters, rent and/or buy Catherine Breillat's films.  Her films are far superior to this trash.   
 If you want to make a young budding girl scientist feel really bad about herself and teach her not to trust men who teach math, this is the perfect book. This author describes women as one-dimensional. The Taliban treated women horrendously but they didn't kick them out of the human race. Flatland basically kicks women out of the human race. This is NOT GIRL FRIENDLY. If you give this to a girl who likes math, there's a good chance she could decide she hates math after reading this 
 The real problem of our time isn't what a terrorist believes, it's what he or she is capable of doing. A band of a few hundred or thousand terrorists can keep the entire world hostage if they are determined enough to seek, procure and use biological or nuclear WMD. Their justifications don't matter that much at all.   This book argues that Al Quaeda's justifications somehow do matter; that they seeks to kills us (the west) for what we do instead of for what we believe in. Understanding what a group of murderous zealots may or may not be motivated by is important only because in understanding them we can more easily attempt to inhibit them. But the author insists it does matter for determining policy alternatives and he goes on to suggest that if we can't destroy Al Quaeda in al all out war we should consider trading in Israel's security and handing over the Arab world to Islamist instead of to Nationalist usurpers.  The problem with the arguments in this book is that they're too emotional; at many times one feels here is someone who is upset with the direction the war on terror has taken and feels his (minority) viewpoint within the CIA has been ignored, he has a 20 year long grump to express. He admits that his editor felt obliged to edit out many of the cynical barbs and yet plenty remain.   Some of the points raised in this book are a stretch. Bin Laden's targets (The Great Satan and Israel) are dramatic abstractions to ordinary Muslims. The idea that it is justifiable to kill nonbelievers because they happen to be from Israel or the US (or Denmark for that matter) is not widely held at all. The author argues that vast numbers of Muslims are siding with Bin Laden's Jihad because it is their Muslim duty to protect the holy places from the infidels. That is nuts. The bible calls for Christians to stone the adulterers too, doesn't mean that any Christian in their right mind is actually going to do so. The author doesn't seem to have any feeling with 'reality' or 'the Muslim street'. His extremist notions are dangerous, if we were to wage the all out war vs Muslim extremism that he suggests we'd be seeing a revolution in Pakistan that could and probably would arm the faithful with nukes.   He suggests two such nutty extremist alternatives: declare an all out war on islamic fundamentalism or seek a Munich-like compromise. But the war hasn't been lost; in Afghanistan the coalition has denied Al Quaeda their primary base of operations. In Iraq the whole Muslim world watched in perplexity and often delight as the Great Satan organized the first free elections there ever. While it's too early to claim the coalition is winning the war on terror, it certainly isn't being lost.  The author's compromise alternative isn't realistic either. Western support for Israel isn't a tactical decision, it has always been about protecting the Jews against forces that seek their extinction; one cannot disregard what happened in 1948 and how bad the 650.000 Palestinian Arab and how good the 850.000 Jewish Arab refugees were treated by their own people. One has to realize that the only Arabs that have democratic rights in the Middle East are the Israeli Arabs. One has to take into account how Arab regimes treat dissent (Hama, Syria, 1982) compared to how Israel handles it. Support for Israel in the west isn't a result of excellent Israeli propaganda, it's there for the same reason that the US maintained troops in Europe after WWII; it is supranational solidarity between those who hold similar values. Only armchair philosophers like the author are too jaded to see the validity of that argument.  One can picture the author sitting as a grumpy analyst at a CIA conference table, bitterly contesting the majority view. He himself admits he's not a hands on type of person, his views are scholarly and not very well honed by personal experience. That's obvious from this book. It's a bestseller only by virtue of making the Bush administration look incompetent.  The Bush administration doesn't need any help there. Some of the criticism is deserved; why go after Iraq? Why suddenly try the kind of social engineering (implant democracy) that conservatives have always decried? Certainly it was brave to try to bring democracy to a people who have suffered so long under various dictatorships and certainly those who understand the gesture (the Kurds) fully appreciate America's intent. But democracy doesn't work when there's no large educated middle class that wants democracy and the rule of law.   We might be loosing the propaganda war for not understanding the romantic appeal of the lone religiously inspired warriors going against the huge a secular empire. Bin Laden is a hero like Che Guevara was one, a romantic with juvenile anti-establisment passions, that's why he's popular. He is winning that battle over the Muslim hearts and minds, and the western world plays right into his hand by trying to present a vast unified goliath force instead of being true to the its diverse, opinionated, free and openly  multicultural nature. We can't murder millions to kill a few, we can't sell out our friends. 
 Title is very mis-leading..grants only apply if you live in certain states. If you need money why would you spend money for a book that does apply to you...waste of money. 
 Honestly, I would have never known that there was a better way to do this if I hadn't had to drop this class last fall for medical reasons, then retake it this spring with different prof. and different book. This d____ed book goes out of its way to make things confusing, causing too much memorization, and intertwines what a vector space is with matrix operations. It really does not have to be this confusing. Further, the guy does not teach you how to do proofs, but then requires you to do them in homework. He doesn't teach you where to start from, or what to think of when doing a proof. Linear Algebra is a tough class to begin with. It is known to be abstract and theoretical. Lay does not need to make an already challenging subject more challenging by presenting it in such a confusing way. Thank God I had to drop last fall. I'd have gotten a C or a D (and I'm a straight A student) if I'd had to stick with the Lay book 
 I waited and waited to purchase this book because I had recently bought a Canon XL2 and wanted to know how to get that "film look" by shooting in 24p.  After several months of delays, the book was finally released and I bought it.  When I read through it I realized that this book was not what the title said it was.  95% of this book talks about the basics of film making; use of wide angle and telephoto lenes, continuity, lighting, etc.  While helpful in its own right, this is not why I bought the book.  There are maybe two chapters that talk about getting the film look for digital video.  I probably could have gotten more detailed instruction off of message boards and newsgroups.    If you're looking for a "how to" when it comes to 24p, pass on this book.  Save the money and do some investigating on the web.  I'm sure you'll find a number of sources that will be able to walk you through the process and you may even get individual instruction 
 I have to agree with a previous review, this book is a disappointment. This book falls somewhere between a blog post and a sophomore CS student term paper. They even pulled that old slightly larger font trick to thicken this book.  The code is so ridiculously simple, repetitive, and inefficient that its almost tedious to read through. I understand the code isn't focused, but their should at least be some logical code. Example after example is so repetitive you really only need to read the first one from each chapter. The chapter on nusoap is literally 3 or 4 pages long and an example of 5 lines of code.  You can find plenty of free resources online that do a better job explaining these theories easier. No need to waste your time or money here. 
 This is not the Richard Ford of The Sportswriter, much less Independence Day; the intervening two decades must have taken a terrible toll on this author.  I found two chapters with dialogue sufficient to engage my interest.  The balance of this novel is filled with so much meaningless, monotonously descriptive narrative that I began to suspect I was reading a New Jersey travel brochure.  I want a refund.  I deserve a refund.    
 Quite possibly the worst book that I have ever read.  It is an infomercial from start to finish.  At least one comparison as to how efficiently Target is managed compared to other stores actually proves the opposite of what the clueless author intends (If you look at the numbers).  It is pure hype with no real value to anyone who graduated high School 
 If you're a hardcore West Wing fan, save yourself some money and nerves and skip this one. It's got more mistakes in it than a high school girl's essay 
 The author created a masterpiece with this book, combining his vast experience of producing humanure with scientific insight, and great humor which made the book fun to read.  I'm convinced that composting manure is the safest way to safely deal with our own excrement.  Our society has got to be crazy to be flushing this immensely valuable resource to be dealt with later as it ends up polluting our rivers, oceans, and drinking water.  I highly recommend this book to any concious reader who would like to greatly reduce their impact upon this earth 
 What a cheat! Don't waste your time. Any good writer can put together a suspense novel; a novel worth reading requires that the author resolve the crime.  The FBI and CIA have no luck; the bad guy has more luck than 12 4-leaf clovers. So, I read through all of it really trying to guess how this will be resolved. But, Stuart Woods can't resolve his own story, so on the last page, the bad guy and his accomplise go to ST.Bart's to start a new life. With this ending, the story is no longer even remotely clever 
 sorry this might be harsh but on my initial listen i knew this was something i didn't want.  its got that "over the top" produced feel to it.  lots of neat effects and great sound but nothing much else.  its not a real deep listening experience.  its cliche.  the fusion just went a bit too far here.  after repeated listens it just went completely flat.  this would make a wonderful sound track for disney's aladdin.    i'll gladly trade this cd for any of the thornton and ramzy cd's 
 It's so unreal to me that someone would write this balderdash! How can they prey on innocent people who have a hard enough time dealing with their very serious, life threatening allergies. This genre of books is very uncool 
 When the "Dummies" series books first came out, they were truly for "dummies". Apparently not so anymore. Right on the cover of this book is the phrase "Go from Web surfer to site developer". Well, web surfer I am, and what I was looking for was a book to give me the ABSOLUTE BASICS about creating a web site. This book assumes that you as the reader, already know how to create a web site!! HELLO!! If I knew how to create a web site, I wouldn't need the book, thanks. Page 2 "Foolish Assumptions": "We figure that you have some kind of experience with creating web pages." WHAT?! I thought this book was going to turn me from a surfer to a developer. Page 27: the first line of chapter 3 reads "This chapter's here just in case you need a refresher on basic web page building before..." CHAPTER 3! Refresher! This book obviously should be titled "Enhancing Your Web Site for Dummies". This book does not even explain to a "Dummy" how to create the file necessary to create a web page. What a waste of twenty bucks 
 Too many steps in this book are vague and don't account for the fact that Maya doesn't always give you the results you are aiming for. The author will explain 2 or 3 steps very well then he seems to give you very little info for the next step, as if rushing through it like "well you should know all this." He assumes too much and in the end I found myself frustrated and lost. I mean if you get the end results but didn't understand the process you did to get there, then did you really learn anything? I go tired of spending 15 minutes staring and 2 pictures and trying to figure out what he did, since he didn't have the brains to tell me in print. Feels like yet another pro trying to teach when he can't remember what its like to be on the level of those he is teaching. If this were a class I'd have to raise my hand every minute and ask him to slow down. Oh, and NO I am not totally new to Maya and I've had very good luck with other books, so its not just some total noob venting. I've tried for weeks now to get into this book, there is just no way to do so as I see it.  In the end, I tossed my copy in the trash, where it belongs 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 I give this book a 2 star because I sort of knew what I was getting into before I read the book.  I was looking for a book that would be a confession of an intimate nature and fast pace so when I saw the audio book of this at the local library I immediately borrowed it.   Awesome tell all book! but I don't know why someone would buy a copy of this and display it at their house.  Your better off displaying a autobiography book of Jackeiey Pedroe in your house....Jackeiey Pedroe who???  EXACTLY!  
 I found the writing weak and the story was not interesting enough for me care about the characters. The cooking segments went on too long and the writer was relying on these long descriptions to carry the story. Sorry, none of it worked for me 
 Mirrors are too small and too distorted.  The picture on the package shows a perfect reflection - as if!!    It's about as useful as taping two foil-wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them 
 This  is one extremely ponderous book to read.  The author makes several well intentioned points, only to get bogged down in his own research and wordiness.  Read it if you must....be sure you have lots of time to decipher it once you have 
 Repeated listenings allow me to moderate the review I posted a while ago. I'm delighed to do it. My original title was "A Time to Despair." Make that "A TIme to Take Stock."  Five of the fifteen cuts are decent -- one or two may even approach greatness -- but whenever the album starts to take flight it crashes back to earth under the weight of songs slow as molasses and twice as syrupy. Ballads have always been the man's undoing. Melodies that are often unmemorable; lyrics so mawkish you can't quite believe your ears. Sure, some have been hits, but still...  After all these years, it's way past time for a friend whose opinion he respects to whisper the words the flunkies around him seem afraid to speak: Stevie, ballads just ain't your thing 
 Two CDs that would fit on one and at a double price. Get another collection 
 This work is a mildly interesting collection of semi-familiar "tales." It is so poorly written that it reads like a first draft.  Where was the editor 
 If you want to learn about the history of physics up to Einstein's theories, you might find this book interesting.  However if you want to learn about present day theories and experiments, this book is outdated and in some cases incorrect.  The authors want to go back to Newton's physics supplemented by Mach's ideas.  This is another volume in the ongoing series "Einstein was Wrong".  In it the authors try to dispute Einstein's theories using old experimental data and theories.  For example, on the bending of starlight around the sun the authors only refer to Eddington's observations of this effect.  These old experiments had a 30% margin of error and the authors imply that Eddington tried to force the data to verify Einstein's theory.  Since Eddington's time this experiment has been done many times, recently with VLBI and have verified Einstein's theory.  The authors state that Newton's theory doesn't give a prediction of this effect, however it does and that prediction is incorrect.  There are many more examples of using old theories to dispute modern physics, but no mention of new experiments that verify it.  I don't recommend this book if you want to learn about modern physics.  John Ree 
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 This book says it's for 16 year olds well I'll say it's for 21 year olds I've read the first 2 started the 3rd one and it's starting to be like Porno I got rid of mine by selling them on ebay but I would get this serie 
 Not that well written. Some of it was more than a little hard to believe. Would not have bought for myself 
 Disorganized vapid prose and loads of wishful "thinking" - it's a gender feminist cream dream.  Better you should read Proust for artistic insight on the topic, and look for a better written and more factual history 
 It seems that all Boren has managed to do in this book is rehash what has already been written and copy letters that have already been published. If you have read Footprints or any George Thompson books you will be sorely disappointed in this one. No new info, just a redo to generate some $$ while Boren is in jail. And by the way, how is he writing this when he has been in jail for the past 10+ years. This is the randoms ramblings of a man in prison too long 
 "The Last American Virgin" was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot. It's not a surprise no one from this film went on to any sort of stardom. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible, the direction was terrible, the pacing was terrible, the jokes were god-awful, etc. Even the girls weren't really that attractive (with the huge '80s hair and bad fashion)! I mean, what the hell was that fat, ugly, dorky girl with the glasses doing in this movie, and, even more perplexing, why was our "hero" trying to lay her?? And why was our "hero" best friends with that jerk who kept screwing him over with the girl he was in love with? They would be at each other's throats in one scene and then best friends in the next! I would say that the only redeeming quality of this movie was the soundtrack, but then they started repeating the same songs over and over again. I guess the producers ran out of money to fund the rights to extra songs. They played "Whip It" twice, "Shake It Up" at least three times, and, at last count, "Just Once" like five times, when "Once" was certainly enough. Songs that I didn't know at the beginning of the movie I  knew by heart word for word by the end. To top it all off, this movie had one of the worst, most disastrous endings I've ever seen. I can maybe understand if this was a heartfelt, coming-of-age drama, but when you're doing a mindless, teen-sex comedy, you don't end on a downer and depress the audience! After all the hell our "hero" goes through, he ends up driving home alone without the girl and still a virgin, and then, without any follow-up or warning, the credits start rolling! I was like, "What the hell?" The only great thing about the movie is that I had a ball paying "MST3K," only no one was around to appreciate my witty, sardonic remarks, so I'll have to reproduce them here for your pleasure:   On Arguing with Your "Best Friend" Over the "Love of Your Life": "Hey, I stalked her first!"   On Sparking Up a Romance with Said Girl: "Remember our awkward conversation in my pizza mobile? Didn't that mean anything to you??"   On Declaring Your Love for Said Girl: "I've loved you ever since I destroyed your bike just so you'd talk to me!"   On Major Operations, "Not that Big a Deal": Real line (referring to the girl's upcoming abortion): "Hey, it happens all the time. It's not that big a deal." My line: "Yeah, it's a simple coat hanger procedure!" (and later) Real line: "I know dozens of girls who've done it!" My line: "I've helped all the gals in the neighborhood. They call me Dr. Abortion!"   On Nerds at Parties: "Man, there's nothing cooler than sucking from a juice box with a straw! Aww, yeah!!"   On Fat Girls, Inconsistent Characterizations of: Real line: "You know I have to be home by a quarter to 12!" (a minute later) "You said you had drugs! Where are they?" My line: "I have to be home by midnight or my parents will kill me! So fu*k me in the a$$ and let's do some blow before they come home!"   On Choose Your Mate Carefully: (as our "heroes" scratch their balls after having sex with a promiscuous, older woman) "Nothing's funnier than getting gonorrhea, eh folks?!"  Skip this dreck and rent "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" instead. At least that one had Phoebe Cates 
 this movie is the consequence of matrices of impossiblities all occuring at the same time! can anyone say: basketball parachutes?, monks with catacombs made of human bones (which is secretly a labratory) and the monks are watching pornography, where did that guy get a tiger from, why try to sufficate someone underwater with a plastic bag, why was van Damme squatting a bathtub, why does Dennis Rodman carry plastic explosives a detonator and a coin Smoke bomb in his pocket at all times, where did Dennis get a dirt bike, why did Dennis take his shirt off after killing that guy, why did Dennis hide the baby? why doesnt hIS care for the babies mom?. . . . . .  the main question is why was this movie created 
 I have the tea bags, which are small but very cute and fit nicely into my childrens' tea cups.  I bought the cookies for them to have with their tea, also tiny but cute and the kids love them. Thought a little milk would be nice to have to go with the tea theme... The milk carton is just too funny though.  As small as their food stuff is, this is miniscule, extremely small. Too small really.  They could have made them a bit bigger.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to have a milk carton that is practically as big as a tea bag.  These are just silly.  
 We all like hearing scary stories about monsters.  This book provides a few of them.  Because of its pulp horror novel quality it has some redeaming value.  The negatives make it not only a bad read, but make me wish that I had not read it. 1) The author spends a lot of time tooting his own horn. This is fine, but you grow weary of it after a few chapters.  It wouldn't be so annoying but because of the way he writes comes off as if he is trying too hard to make it sound like NOT bragging.  Because of this I grew very aware of it, like when your tounge won't stop worrying at a new tooth-filling. 2) It grows very predictable.  We get it!  Serial killers are psychos who fit into patterns and act out fantasies. It isn't a surprise anymore once we learned this early in the book. 3) Ressler brags about his profile helping to send 4-5 Chicago teenagers to prison for a a grusome murder/rape.  A decade after this book went to press DNA evidence and discovery of the real killers proved that these kids had been railroaded--unequivocally innocent.  Ooops!  This incredibly gross injustice wouldn't seem so terrible if Ressler didn't come off as such a judgemental, I-told-you-so-ing, J. Edgar Hoover loving cop's cop 
 Read the Unbox terms of use CAREFULLY before choosing this route over a regular DVD purchase.  It is not your usual set of "blah blah" legal jargon.  For example, 3c: "Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you."  If you ever remove the Unbox software, Amazon may revoke your ability to view the Firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine!  Amazon, I've ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience; why did you let Unbox create these anti-customer terms of use?? 
 I don't know whether it's Amazon or all retailers that have this problem, right now, but HoF freezes at the 13:58 mark. Don't purchase it for a year or so. Let retailers get in a fresh, undamaged shipment, and then try again 
 Power of Purpose would make a great magazine article, but there is not enough content here to make a good book.  "Creating Meaning in Your Life..." is not what this book is about.  There is lots of talk about  how important it is to have purpose in your life, but little about how to  create it.  Mr. Leider has a great reputation -- it must have come from his  other books 
 This is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to read: academic writing style, feeble plot, very forced. There is no humour or humanity in this book. A complete waste of a good tree 
 Christianity has created an Arch enemy of the Creator for which intrigue youth and those who deeply feel that "God" hates and/or abandons them for what ever reason.  These feelings are steeped in "less than" and fear based teachings.  When someone believes they are reject of "God" their creator, they will seek out acceptance.  Just reading the first few pages of this book it became clear to me this had nothing to do with Satanism, but rather mixed up, kids - identifying with the Christian and Hollywood context of "Satanism" for shock factor.  "Pentagrams carved into my arms...", well a Pentagram has nothing to do with Satanism, and is an ancient symbol representing the 4 elements and the 5th element of "Spirit".  Kids would not have these delusions about "Satan" or "Satanism" if they were not taught them to be later used for "shock" factor.   They would not become obsessed with evil if the "Good" religions of the world would cease their obsession and teachings of "command and control", and "less than" theologies.  If your interested in learning about "Satanists" go visit their website, ask them questions, learn about why and how they came into existence.  Truth Filter #5 - "All serves and is subject to the Divine" - Satan, adopted somewhere around 240AD from Arab Jinn legends, became a powerful tool for "The Church".  Satanism, (not to be confused with Luciferians), is fairly recent "Church" which was founded I believe in the 80's in California.  They stand in bold defiance to Church Hypocrisy, some would say "Christian" hypocrisy.  Keep in mind that "Satanist" is a Roman Term, meaning adversary of the "The Church", specifically "The Church of Rome", known today as "The Roman Catholic Church".  Technically - if you "oppose" the Roman Catholic Church, or any of its dogma's or teachings - then "technically" based on the origins of the label "Satanist", you would be a "Satanist".  Keep in mind this title had little to do with your belief or no-belief in Satan.  Those who would wear a "Pentagram", the "Witches", or the Pagans did not, and do not believe in "Satan".  In fact, I am not certain Satanists "believe" in Satan, but Satan does serve their role and mission which is to annoy Christians and make them "think".  Truth and Historical Facts are interesting things.  Do your own research.   There will be "weirdo" and troubled people who will turn to the name "Satan" and align themselves with "evil" for the shock factor and attention getting of "evil".  Some may even claim to take directions by "Satan", many mental patients have cited demons and Satan as the cause for their problems.  We blame evil and Satan for many things that happen in our lives.  The real "seduction" & "evil" happened many thousands of years and was backed by many attrocities.  It is good that you are seeking truth.  The answers and solutions are rooted in Love, and learning that you are not "less than".

 Since the Disney version is not currently for sale, many customers may be tempted to buy this ripoff as a second choice. If you're in that camp, please don't bother. Either wait for the Disney re-release or buy the Disney version used.  It's no surprise that the production values are very poor. That's par for the course with this type of low budget production. Given my daughter's extreme enthusiasm at finally receiving Pinocchio (as a gift) we decided to give it a go. The adults in the room found it painful to watch given the poor characterization, the plot that jumps around so much as to be completely incoherent and the overall cynical low-budget approach to the material. My 4-year-old found the entire plot and the world the video presents to be scary and depressing. She was actually crying at the end of it, even despite the supposedly happy ending. She insisted on watching through to the end in hopes that some ray of light would appear to lift her spirits -- no such luck! The good characters are completely unconvincing. I hate to say this about any movie, but it just felt evil through and through. This version lacks the charm of the Jiminy Cricket character, and their version of Pinocchio has no personal warmth or other redeeming characteristics to draw you in. His relationship with Gepetto seems artificial and forced. There are no warm or positive elements to counteract the pervasive evil of the world Pinocchio falls into. And, of course, none of the charming musical numbers that kids love so much.  Overall, just a horrendous experience for young and old. Avoid this one if you can 
 Lal's book is full of assertions such as the following: "This papal revolution, by promoting love as the basis of marriage and advocating the independence of the young, led to the rise of individualism in the West". Praise be to Gregory the Great, our 6th century benefactor who started the ball rolling. Well, that's that thorny little issue sorted out, isn't it? Now, if you don't think this is ludicrously simplistic and reductionist, you might enjoy this book, considering it to be another sharp little tool in the right-wing intellectual box. If, on the other hand, you would perhaps consider failing a student essay that contained such a statement, you might find this book excruciatingly irritating, superficial and misleading. Perhaps gagging is a bit too lenient, after all 
 After reading all of the positive reveiws and only a few negative ones I purchased this humidifier back in Dec. Well here it is early Feb and this thing just plain sucks. I have a digital humidistat sitting right next to it in a med size room (13x13) and it never reaches higher that 29%. In the dry months of winter 29% is unacceptable, and my eyes nose and throat would agree. So don't do what I did, and save your money. Or if you must try it, just be prepared to send it back or donate it to goodwill. Enjoy 
 You've got to be kidding me, right?  So, he writes the SAME BOOK ABOUT WICCA as everyone else does, substitutes "night" for "day," uses a spooky font and peddles it to the goth market?  There's little, if anything of value in here.  It's the same rehashed stuff that you see in every other Llewellyn book, only with the "goth" label on it.  Don't waste your time 
 For some reason this book became a breakthrough in the late 1970s in Pauline studies. In fact, ever since the publication of this book Pauline studies has never been the same. The impact this book has made since is felt in both the academia and church. Unfortunately, the book is really biased on its use of Second Temple literature and its understanding of Paul's relationship to Second Temple Judaism. Having read most of the first section (the teachings of Second Temple/Rabbinic Judaism) and all of the second section (Paul and his teachings) Sanders portrays a very gracious view of Second Temple/Rabbinic Judaism and a very Jewish and law friendly Paul. However, after reading this book and comparing it to the critiques of this reading of Second Temple/Rabbinic Judaism and Paul's relationship to it I have to conclude that Sanders has not done his homework or that he wrote with an agenda.   Though Sanders does correct some of the negative portrayals of Judaism by many evangelical scholars since the time of the Reformation, I would have to say that he does not totally liberate ST/Rabbinic Judaism as pictured as a works-righteousness or legalistic religion. In fact, even if you read Sanders' take on the Tannaitic and DSS literature you will find that ST/Rabbinic Judaism is still to some degree works-righteous and legalistic. Even though he rightly points out that ST/Rabbinic Judaism is not pelagian or advocates a legalist God, the religion he paints is more semi-pelagian or "Romish." He acknowledges that in ST/Rabbinic Judaism that an Israelite can be kicked out of the covenant for very serious offenses and that everyone will be judged according to their deeds by the standards of the Torah. Even though God will be gracious in how he judges his people, they will still need to do their best (within the realm of the covenant and God's grace) to achieve eschatological salvation. The evangelical equivalent to this view is the view espoused (more or less) by Charles Finney, Holiness Wesleyans, Churches of Christ, Seventh-Day Adventists, United Pentecostals, and Evangelical Outreach. Sanders' attempt to liberate ST/Rabbinic Judaism as a legalistic religion is only partially successful. ST/Rabbinic Judaism even under Sanders' depiction advocates a works-righteousness salvation to some degree. It definitely did not advocate sola fide and sola gratia.   The more problematic part of the book is Sanders' take on Paul. He believes that Paul (since he was still a Jew even after his Damascus Road experience) borrowed a lot from ST/Rabbinic Judaism in regards to soteriology. In fact, Sanders states that Paul held to a "Christian" covenantal nomism (pp. 511-515). Though the new covenant is new and available to non-Jews it still holds to the basic structure of covenantal nomism found in ST/Rabbinic Judaism: one enters the covenant by grace and baptism and one stays in that covenant by obedience to the law (or the new law of Christ). A believer can be expelled from the covenant (and eventually from eschatological salvation) by heinous sin or apostasy (p. 513). Contrary to some misguided and uneducated Presbyterian and Reformed pastors (those P & R pastors who don't even know what their own confessions teach) the view of Judaism and Paul advocated in this book is contrary to the P & R tradition. For instance, in the Westminster Confession of Faith, it states in regards to justification: "God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may by their sins fall under God's Fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance" (XI.5). To say that the WCF promotes a type of covenantal nomism is utterly ridiculous. The confession is clear that even sin still does not forfeit the believer's righteous standing before God's judgment bar.   Another key question to ask is: if Sanders' portrayal of Paul is correct what is the point of Christ's death? Of course, Sanders does not believe that Jesus Christ is the God-man as articulated in the great Christian creeds and confessions thus he is excused from this. However, a Christian who adopts Sanders' covenantal nomism really has to struggle with the idea of what Christ accomplished on the cross. Did Christ merely open the door so that people can start working their way up to heaven? Or did Christ fully pay the price for the sins of the elect? These are questions that Christians who have adopted the New Perspective have to ask themselves 
 Pat Robinson sounds like a cult leader with his "our one true God", not only is he a hypocrite and an absolute bigot, he thinks liberals are all baby-killing, teen emancipating, thief consenting and emybro disecting freaks! Does he expect all 'pure' christians to sit church and read the bible all their damn life? This is the 21st century, none of these holier than thou concepts of living is feasible in this day and age is he kidding? are we all just an great dissapointment to God because we arnt like the rightous Pat Robinson? he is an agitator and too blind with his own hypocricy to even discern what is of God and what isnt 
 I recently received this as a Christmas gift, and it didn't work from the start. After much time wasted with their "tech support" the device was deemed defective. Their tech support is very poor - all they could say, "try another Xd card". The device kept freezing my system, the driver that came with the software didn't work, a very frustrating experience. If the tech support was more informative or supportive, Lexar might have redeemed itself. I recently purchased the Sandisk 5 in 1 reader and it works like a charm, right from the start. Their quick start guide is much more detailed, and their software works! Save yourself a headache and buy Sandisk 
 All Covey is saying in his longwinded book, basically, is this: Listen to the people you love. Put the family first in all your decisions. Blah blah blah and something about synergy.  The writing is horrible, and the metaphors are overused. I also dislike Covey's plagiarizing material from the Bible and not acknowledging where he gets his "inspiration".  In one passage he equates the Bible and other books of scripture with "Chicken Soup For the Soul" as "wisdom literature".  Despite being a supposed devout Mormon himself, obviously he's afraid to mention the Book of Mormon in that passage. Perhaps he's afraid of scaring away potential pigeons--I mean, readers.   This was a book my book club decided to read; otherwise I'd have never even tried to get past the first few pages. I wonder how a man who is on the road more often than not can really interact with his own family and give "us", the poor ignorant masses, advice on our own families. In one passage he even says that other people's advice may not apply to our own situations. Then how can he expect us to take his advice?   Don't waste your money. If you absolutely must read it, get it from the library. Covey doesn't need your money, he has a huge house with a basketball court and indoor pool. He's doing fine. 
 I got this book from the library and was reading it with my daughter. The illustrations are wonderful and overall it is a good introductory to evolution for kids. However I find it unbelieveable that the author describes the appearance of the primate/human "common ancestor" as being descended from apes. For someone who thinks himself knowlegable enough to be writing educational books for any age on the theory of evolution this "mistake" is unforgivable.  Considering the idea is the most repeated falsity used by ignorant opponents of evolution. You are not helping to educate children by feeding them ignorance. It`s enough to keep me from reading anything else written by this author 
 The so called acting alone will make you want to toss it out the window.  Don't waste your money on this loser 
 As an active duty chaplain in the military I had a significant interest in chapter 9, Priests and Padres.  First, I was amazed at the number of references and her ability to read, organize, and synthesize them into a narrative.  These references, however, are derived from a significant number of ministers writings or sermons, which became the framework for her conclusions.  Furthermore, multiple references, representing several wars, are devoid of their cultural-historical context and woven into one sentence or paragraph leaving the reader to think the behavior, concept, or issue is timeless and characteristic of clergy.  I don't consider the chapter a valid historical analysis because of the limitations of the source material.  What the chapter does provide is a summary of her sources convictions and behaviors-which is not the whole story.  Since I considered her conclusions in chapter 9 highly subjective I did not read the rest of the book 
 I have three of her books and find the best one to be the backyard book and this one is good for the teaching and to get kids into of the cooking but some of them are a little hard for some if you don't bring all that you need to cook and she does repeet her shelf like she is looking for ideas or new food. In all I say its not bad for getting a dead line done 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
      First off, Desperation and The Regulators is not the same story. Yes certain characters are used, (some in name only) but that's all apart of the pun involved. The Regulators is supposedly the discovered manuscript of Richard Bachman, about an evil entity named Tak, who telepathically terrorizes a small suburban Ohio town through the use of a child's television heroes. Desperation, on the other hand, is about a mistakenly discovered tommyknocker, (not to be confused with the SK novel by the same name) who can manipulate and posses other living beings in the fictitious town of Desperation, NV. (Tak is also the antagonist in this prose.)       Without rehashing the synopsis of either book, this Stephen King fan enjoyed Desperation to a higher degree than The Regulators. In my opinion, the latter seems more of an extended short story and at no time did I find myself even remotely attached to any character presented in the material. Desperation however, was a more enjoyable read with a deeper plot line and thoroughly developed characters. If you happen to read The Regulators before Desperation don't fret. Neither book is in any kind of sequential order. Read one and think of the other as some sort of parallel universe.  
 My son hated this mat at first, then he played in/with it for about 5 days...after that, it got old! Mighty quickly. My son is now about to make 5 months old, and he doesn't even want to look at it. Waste of money for me 
 I returned this camera after trying very hard to like.  Picture quality (movie or still) is totally unacceptable.  I did not even get one good still picture.  Forget about indoors video or still.  The falsh and video light are useless.  The overall quality of the camera is low. 
 You will need deep pockets and a strong stomach for wipsaws inorder to succeed with a somewhat subjective method. It may be useful as a confirming directional tool, but so are simple moving averages. I was disappointed and found the method incompatible 
 I wonder if she's going to "write" a second book called "Jessica Simpson I Don't:  Achieving Your Dream Divorce".  
 I was really looking forward to reading this book after having read many of the glowing reviews. While Jim Fusilli is an author with potential I was largely disappointed in Closing Time, his first effort. The basic premise is interesting and Fusilli's descriptive abilities of the sights and sounds of New York strongly ring true. However, the plot is too drawn out and Fusilli seems unable to forego describing all the thoughts and feelings of his main character, Terry Orr. By the time I got through the first quarter of Closing Time (about 75 pages), I was spending as much time thinking about what to read next as on the story itself. Closing Time is not a bad book, it's just not an especially good one. If you're into reading the first works of authors with promise, than Closing Time might be worth your time -- but buy in paperback, or better still, get it from the library. Otherwise, since there are so many books and so little time, I'd suggest you skip this book 
 I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.  I feel like the characters have lost their voices.  The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books.  Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books.  I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone.  I tried to start the next book, and it was worse.  Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series.  
 I love the Goos, however I can only recommend this single only to diehard Goo fans. I don't expect Johnny and the boys to put out an album like Hold Me Up, Superstar Carwash, or even A Boy Named Goo, but it seems like they've lost their rocker souls and have settled for being banal adult contemporary (ac) musicians. Better Days lacks the passion, grit, and ingenuity of past songs like Name, Flattop, We are The Normal, Iris, and Two Days in February. Better Days sounds like the usual sappy drivel produced by ac musicians like Kelly Clarkson, Ryan Cabrera, and Howie Day.  The Goos might be pushing 40 but they can rock harder and produce better music than this. Look at The Rolling Stones. Although overrated in my opinion they still know how to rock out. 
 just got this installed today, and it was fine for maybe 3 minutes, now it just doesn't send anything.  It goes back to the store in a few days.  Hopefully I can uninstall the crap software in put on--seems as though i'll have to track down where it is on the computer first...........don't buy this!!!!!!!!!! 
 Bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago (three computers at home) and worked ok- no viruses. Then I did what I thought was a clean install of XP Pro from XP Home on one of the computers, and it carried over a lot of garbage from XP Home I wanted to get rid of, but that's another issue (clean install?}. After installing XP Pro, I was warned I didn't have virus protection and so I tried installing my NAV again. You would think at some point NAV would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a Windows upgrade, and that the NAV was legitimate. Nope- fatal error and computer lock-up, which I was able to survive. No contact opportunity at the Symantec web site.  I simply opted for Microsoft's recommended anti-virus software- Computer Associates. Another twenty. Then I had a heck of a time uninstalling NAV, which wouldn't install and now wouldn't uninstall. What a waste of time and money. Who creates these viruses? We certainly know who benefits from them.  There is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout. This little note means diddily, but thanks to Amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something.   
 Following the reviews on this site, I purchased this book for my 10 year old. She has not taken to it very much and finds it "confusing" "busy" and "unclear". It is a very quirky book with tons of graphics and all forms of letter fonts. It is far from straight forward. 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 I bought this book based on previous reviews, most of them enthusiastic.  This book is actually very weak. The technical part is confused and lacks of rigor, the business part is copied from the WiMAX Forum paper (or the WiMAX Forum writer copied the author of this book..). In addition, the entire book is full of repetitions and redundancies. I do not reccomend to buy it 
 I like the philosophy line, but the Vanilla Birthday Cake body wash doesn't smell so much like birthday cake as it does bananas. The product is great though 
 Glenn Hammond Curtiss appears to be a fascinating and underrated participant in the development of human flight. Unfortunately, I don't feel I know much more about him after reading "Unlocking The Sky" than I did before.  For whatever reason, Seth Shulman seems more interested in attacking the Wright Brothers (apparrently for what could be considered simply protecting their ideas and inventions) than in describing Curtiss's acccomplishments.  I've seen many errors and unfair comments pointed out in other reviews by folks with much more knowledge of aeronautics and flight history than I have. To this list I'll add (or point out again, if its already been covered) Shulman's constant mocking of the Wrights for some of their ideas that became "obsolete" some time later.  Should we also mock Alexander Graham Bell because we moved on to dial telephones, touch tone phones, cordless phones, and then cell phones? Or more to the point, should we mock Curtiss for his courageous and historic flight over New York because such a flight became routine in a relatively short time?  2 stars for what information one can gleam about Curtiss from this book.  No more because of the bizarre Wright bashing.  This being said, I recommend this book along with James Tobin's "To Conquer the Air" (instead of using the "instead of" option), for two differing views of the Wright Brothers 
 I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this title.  I thought it would include fabric stamping not just paper stamping.  This is for scrapbookers more than quilters.  The quilts are made by embellishing with paper that has been rubber stamped and objects glued onto the project.  Not washable and definately not for me.  Doesn't seem very durable and falls into art quilt catagory.  I was interesting in learning more about embellishing quilts but paper and glued objects does not do much for me.  I am sure it would appeal more to the scrapbooker or fiber artists more than a more traditional quilter who enjoys fabric and washable quilts 
 I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW POOR THIS PRODUCT WAS MADE. THE HELL WITH THIS PRODUCT. NOBODAY NOOOOOOOOOBOOOOOODY BUY THSI PRODUCT. TALK ABOUT POOR 
 I was looking forward to reading this book on what I thought would be a keen insider's look at the Cuban missile crisis, and was somewhat disappointed.  I realize that RFK was not able to complete the text, and perhaps that is reflected in it's length (100 pages of narrative).  A large part of the printed material, about 1/3, is made up of supporting documents.  I had hoped for more detail about the minute-to-minute events of those 13 days.  The strength of the book is its undeniably interesting topic and author.  There was insight to the crisis that I had not previously known, and reading it here was interesting and informative.  For a mid-1900's buff, this might be one piece of a collection and its uniqueness may prove worthwhile.  This is the first book I read on the Cuban missile crisis, and I am left wanting a lot more 
 If you loved the Back to the Future trilogy and, generally speaking, time traveling extravaganzas on the silver screen... simply forget about buying this DVD. All being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie, while you try to figure out all the "time-traveling science" you've been taught so far, then space you out close to the end, leaving you totally speechless. This is not good, simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real time-traveling pros, while winding up with some abrubt, nonsense end of the movie, with absolutely no sci-fi logic at all: they simply had to eventually stop shooting, so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick, no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot. Not a sci-fi movie and not a romantic story either: look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie 
 This book is not for young children.  I purchased this for my 5 year old who is just crazy about pirates and I was did not end up giving it to him.  Heed the age recommendations.  There are a few disturbing images of pirate punishment devices.  It is an informative and interesting book for older children though.  
 The old version of this book had 16 pages of index.  This version of the book has only 3 pages of index.   Not happy. Fre 
 This book was basically unreadable.  It was simply white supremacy wrapped up in fake and unprovable science.  I can't believe this idiot has a degree in anything much less in nueroscience, probably doesn't.  I noticed that he loves to talk about "white power" in his reviews, he is pushing a hateful agenda and not true science.  Run do not walk away from this piece of trash 
 O.K., our P.E. teacher made us sit through this hour-and-fifteen minute load of junk one day during class one day. Let me say I only enjoyed the movie slightly because it beat being fried in the boiling heat outside. First of all, the plot has so many holes in it I seriously think that someone held the script up to the wall and shot twenty rounds at it. Secondly, I believe I watched an episode of Teletubbies once and laughed more then than I did during this movie. Finally, the movie is more bland than a block of tofu. No action, no drama, not the slightest trace of good humor. 
 Jacobs must have an excellent publicist because this book was the talk of the knitting community before it was even printed!  The Friday Night Knitting Club is the story of a group of women who get together and knit, except they never really do much knitting at the club meetings, and I never felt like I really knew the characters.  The character development was lame.  I think if Jacobs had put more effort into it, these could have been characters that we care about.  A better choice for a can't-put-it-down read about knitting is Debbie Macomber's "A Good Yarn" and even the teen-lit "Chicks with Sticks" series is better than this.  
 Funny enough, I am Shine's target audience... a stay-at-home mom who believes my children come first, agrees that cultivating a healthy relationship with my husband is important, buys organic, does my best to take care of myself etc.  I thought I would love this book.  I WANTED to love this book.  I believe we should champion SAHPs more and I was thrilled to find a book that seemed to do just that.  But as I was reading I was stunned to find that while I agreed in principle with nearly everything Shine said, I couldn't get past her highly judgemental, snotty way of referring to those different than herself.   She chides the women's rights movement for not being more supportive of SAHMs (agreed) and declares she wishes we could all be sisters and supportive of one another.  Yet she is highly critical of these "sisters" whose choices differ from her own. My jaw dropped when she referred to an overweight woman in the grocery store a "fat a#$."  I don't remember ever calling my own sister a fat a#$!  Shine is not the voice of stay-at-home-moms I was looking for. 
 I expected something different in terms of his music. At the same time I received the product promptly and in great condition 
 Don't buy this book unless you would like to imagine the male character (who is supposed to be a 2000 year old very powerful vampire) been raped by 3 elder female vampires over and over until the end of the book. 
 This book serves a good purpose by giving the reader a general history of the FBI and some war stories of some agents.  But the title is MISLEADING.  Fully 2/3 of this book have nothing to do with a guide to employment with the FBI.  The 1/3 which does deal with this subject is almost taken verbatim from the FBI's employment website and consists of generalized statements.  Not too much help here 
 If you're looking for the text of the Gospel of Judas, you want the one edited by Rudolphe Kasser, Marvin Meyer, and Gregor Wurst and published by National Geographic, under ISBN 1426200420.  Robinson's book is a narrative that was written without seeing the manuscript of the Gospel.  Apparently, he tried to jump on the Judas bandwagon with very little to go on.  So don't be deceived by the title... 
 i'm sorry but this is one of the weakest biographies i have ever read (and yes, i have read more than one). the writing is very poor, it reminds me of a grade 8 essay where you can easily see the way the facts have been jotted down in point form and then strung together to form sentences and paragraphs. i feel like half the time the author was simplky reciting a stat or tidbit jotted down on a cocktail napkin.  hendrix never comes alive in this book, you never get a feel for who the man was or where his genius came from and took him. it all feels very quick and breezy, little commentary or insight and more just a retelling of facts long since comitted to the annals of rock legend.  i daresay that the author would have done well to read the few cover stories on jimi put out over the years by britain's mojo magazine. these manage, in their few short pages, to tell the same story in a far deeper and more meaningful way.  when one compares this with - for example - neil young's biography 'shakey' by jimmy mcdonough, one can immediately see the difference between a well written biog and a poorly written one. icons are always a tough creature to dissect, there are layers and layers of worship and legend to get through to get to the real facts and paint a glimpse of the real person. but this also involves good writing; a biographer cannot simply write as a journalist, reciting facts and taking a time-out from any sort of personal insight or commentary. ultimately a good biographer seeks to explore the individual, to journey through their life and vividly assemble and comment on the facts, events, rumours, heresay, and legends that create that persona.  that is rarely done in this biog. this is a safe, conservative, backseat look at an artist who was rarely anything other than a complex genius who truly needs to be looked at with a critical as well as factual eye to fully understand.  not so the case here. skiiiiiiiiip it.   
 Having read the Letters from a Nut series, I was excited to see this title. After reading though, the main problem is the length of the stories. The letters were just the right length to get in some absurdiy, then let the targets reply. In this book, the Stories drag on forever, with people regurgitating things, men trying to kiss the male narrator, his girlfriend and chihuahua sharing a name, leading to reader boredom. Halfway through, I started thumbing for the replies. 
 My 25" NEC tube TV of 18 years went on the blink again.  I've had it reparied a few times for $150.00 here $200.00 there and pondered replacing it with another tube TV like 27" Sony Trinitron or Samsung for $379.00.  But then I saw this Sylvania 26" HDTV for $499.00 and thought it was time to move up to high tech for a few dollars more.  I ordered it and received great service with quick 2 day delivery.  However, I was immediately dissapointed with the picture quality, much worse then my old TV of 18 years, but I still had hope because I was still waiting for my HD cable box.  After 10 days I got my HD cable box installed and while I saw a big improvement it was still not the quality picture I expected.  So from about a $200.00 repair of my old TV to $379.00 new tube TV to $499.00 HDTV I returned the Sylvania 26 HDTV and ordered a 32" Samsung HDTV LNS3251S form Amazon and am VERY pleased with this new TV.   Great picture in HD and digital plus happier with the larger screen 
 Like others, I began the book optimistically, believing that the author just might have something to add to understanding "why" people are not exercising their creativity and independent thought.  Instead, I was exposed to the author's blame of the entertainment business, academia (specifically, Cultural Studies), and the political parties, where each is allegedly part of a greater conspiracy by Big Business to suppress people's imagination and critical thinking because our culture is clearly not churning out anything as memorable as Shakespeare.  *AHEM*  When he hissed and spitted about today's campus poets and philosophers not even willing to speak to one another, I did some critical thinking of my own, asking "Who is this guy and what does he do for a living?"  According to the biographical blurb on the dust jacket, he's an English prof at a university in Illinois.  He's not an artist, he's not an entertainer, he's not a politician, he's not a business person, and he's not even a prof in a social science department (i.e., poli sci, anthropology, cultural geography, history etc.).   If he WAS, he would understand that every generation of every culture, within its own context, has its own creative and intellectual greatness that rises above a lot of schlock, and it's USUALLY under-rated at the time.  But if the author had taken the time to actually interact with those of other academic disciplines, he'd have learned that and his result would have been different 
 OK, I got suckered by reading good reviews on the net, and over hearing a trainer at the gym singing praises of Lipo6. So despite that I have never found a weight loss supplement that actually worked, I decided I'd give it a whirl.   I was amused by a previous review which says DON'T TAKE IT IF YOU'RE ALREADY A HEALTHY WEIGHT! Well...she then goes on to mention she is a VERY healthy 5'1" and 115 lbs! But she took it??? Should have been a red flag to me.   I must be the only one (don't see this side effect mentioned elsewhere), but this made me a total BEAR to live with (ok, not the B word I REALLY want to describe myself as, but it's the PG version). I was irritable, had daily headaches, and saw no movement on the scale whatsoever!   Waste of money, waste of time, waste of quiet evenings at home ruined by my annoyed mood! 
 In Hollnger's well-intentioned book, the heroes of the story are the multi-racial citizens pushing for designations outside what he calls "the ethno-racial pentagon." They are, for him, harbingers of a civic nationalism that can mediate between arrogant ethnic groups and a diverse globe. In other words, his ideal America will be a multiethnic nation whose true, uniting ethnicity is located in the ideals enshrined in our founding documents. With those universal sentiments in hand, we can also help end racist injustice in the undemocratic world and bring about human progress toward democracy.  This happy picture of the multi-racial, humanitarian nation, however, does not investigate the long history of *passing* for white, nor the current profitability of Michael Jackson's pop-culture descendants -- the Vin Diesels who refuse to divulge their racial identity and the Jennifer Lopezes who claim an ethnic/minority identity while hewing close to white looks and tastes. The trend of passing shows that people of color have long benefited by distancing themselves from their despised origins, by playing against a type that remains in place despite their success and precisely to burnish their success. The trend of the multi-ethnic or crossover star indicates that white skin may not be the only skin color that opens social and economic doors. To it we may now add indeterminate or boldly ethnic skin that may be read as exotic, as white, or, at the least, within the reach of whites' desires as consumers.  This brings me to my last point. Hollinger suggests that we should be able to choose racial identities by our affiliations, not by our genetics. Again, his accounting of history (other than intellectual history) is incomplete. The cosmopolitan familiarity with all peoples he proposes seems a wonderful example until we realize he has not accounted for the ways in which class position allows for such a sampling. Whether through travel, education, exposure to public art, or the purchase of entertainment commodities, a cosmopolitan famiiliarity with the world's goods comes at a price. So, the rich get richer... and the rich person with cosmo aspirations gets more cosmo, too. Because of the various privileges granted to white families in terms of financial credit, home loans, and other subtle and unsubtle handouts, whites are in a better position to take advantage, as a collective, of cosmopolitanism. Thus, cosmopolitanism does not upset racial hierarchy.  While I can't disagree with the *aim* of Hollinger's book, I also cannot suggest that his analysis is sound nor his project tenable 
 The song listing shows Red Red Wine is live.  In reality there are 13 live recordings on here. Most of this 2 disc set is filled with alternate versions of the hits.  The first disc tries to pass off the first 8 or 9 tracks as being the original mono singles. I've got most of those tracks on mono 45s and these are NOT the same versions. These sound like early mixes or even demos in one or two cases.  They are missing instruments, have weak vocals, and are overall NOT the "hit" versions of these early songs. Then the set goes to live recordings for the next 3rd of the tracks. Only on the latter tracks does it contain the released "hit" versions of Neil's songs.  Stay away from this unless you are a completist looking for alternate versions of his hits.  
 Kudos to the translator for making the effort; certainly Heidegger isn't an everyday walk in the park. However, the difficulty in reading Heidegger's work is absolutely essential to fully Understanding how the inquery into Being is to be conducted. This recent translation lends too easily to the science of psychology, and is, hence, antithetical to the originality of Heideggerian 'brand' humanism. The profundity of "being and time" is to be discovered by the individual, by his own means; to use public language obliterates any hope of this 
 In an email, Adorama specified that the filter diameter was, "28mm." On the amazon.com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting! Either they don't know their products or they don't care about the customers. Now I have to return it because of faulty information they supplied. Please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25% of the purchase price - an amount I feel is beyond absurd. I can buy this locally for a lot less (even though I would have to pay sales tax). Buyer beware 
 I think this book had some very good pointers. However, for an advanced beginner, or lower end intermediate player the way it explains things is difficult to understand in several areas. If you are advanced this book would be good, but it doesn't make it clear in the advertizing that this book is for advanced players only 
 This book is terrible!  It gives different definitions for the same term several times in the first few chapters.  Why doesn't it just give one coherent, comprehensive definition for each word?!! The concepts are broken up and presented helter-skelter, so reading this book is like working a tedious jigsaw puzzle. Then it includes lots of problems at the end of each chapter, but there is no answer key, and the Solutions Manual is only available to teachers.  Do they think that my professor is too lazy or too stupid to make up his own tests? (Hint to oblivious writers/editors: a textbook is useless if students cannot practice working problems and check the answers on their own.  This is not third grade, and my professor is not a babysitter!)  I bought the workbook (which contains practice tests) separately, but I still don't have the answers to the problems at the end of the chapters. I will speak to the department heads at my college and beg them to switch publishers next semester 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 I've read this book with my third graders for the past several years.  They love it.  They enjoy having a candy corn contest of their own while reading the book 
 I actually could not even complete the book.  I feel that the prose is somewhat circular and felt that the book was disorganized.  However, my main problem was with the writing.  I had a difficult time following the book 
 Punk, like all great rock music, was a rebellion, in this case against the excesses of the late '60s and early '70s.  BUt somewhere along the way, it was unavoidable that bands would come along that loved the energy and honesty of punk and the very material they were rebelling against-- in the case of XTC, the lush pop and psychedelia of the late '60s.  But these influences were far receeded on their debut album, "White Music" is firmly lodged in the sounds of punk and new wave and is, more than anything else, an album of energy music.  The net result of this is that hte album is inevitably at odds with the strenghts of the band-- songwriters Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding would come later to excel at lush, detailed arrangement full of unerring pop hooks, textures and harmonies, but here, it's all very stripped back, ska and punk influenced pop.  Moulding's trademark slithering bass isn't quite in place yet, though he's already starting to find holes to fit himself in, he primarily forms a solid lockstep with drummer Terry Chambers.  Partridge's guitar, for his part, limits largely to angular punk and ska trends-- loud and aggressive, pushing the music along from the front, which leads Barry Andrews' buzzing organ sound to be largely the soloing voice in the band.  But with all this, the real weakness was singing voices too used to poor microphones of cheap clubs-- Partridge and Moulding both use an unnatural, clipped vocal style that seems more concerned with trying to annunciate than anything else, to the detrimant of the band's sound.  With all of this creating an unnatural tension on the album, it still manages to hit pretty frequently, helped no doubt by the fact that Partridge's songwriting was already top notch.  Standout "Statue of Liberty" best illustrates this-- hints of ska, gentle organ textures, and a funky bassline over which Partridge's clever story of unrequited love can be read out.  Nearly as notable are punky opener "Radios in Motion" (full of crackling punk energy), the loose-yet-detailed arrangement of early single "This is Pop?" (featuring the closest Partridge would ever come to snarling punk rebellion, even if it is laden with great pop hooks), and new wave gem "Atom Age", with just enough of a hint of Brian Wilson to pull it above the rest.  On the other hand, there's a lot of largely forgettable material-- Moulding's songwriting feels like it's not quite ready ("Set Myself on Fire") and his vocal is even more painfully forced than Partridge's ("Cross Wires"), and even Partridge has a couple duds ("Spinning Top").  Add to this an ill-conceived ska take on "All Along the Watchtower" that makes Partridge sound like a bad Hendrix imitator and you end up with a pretty mixed package.  The reissue adds quite a bit to the original-- remastered sound that has the net effect of making the record sound a bit more dated than it probably would at least provides clarity to the music and there's seven bonus tracks-- early singles and the "3D EP".  Most of this stuff is largely forgettable (Moulding's "Heatwave", Partridge's "Dance Band" and "Traffic Light Rock"), but early single "Science Friction" and its b-side "She's So Square" are pulsing full of nervous tension and energy and make a decent listen.  XTC would find enormous heights in the following decade, and I can't help but color my reviews of their early material based on the heights they'd eventually reach.  I have a sneaking suspicion that had I not heard what they'd be capable of in the future, I'd be inclined to give this a much higher rating, but compared to their later work, "White Music" sounds positively amateurish.  It's got its moments, but they'd go on to do a lot better 
 Sorry, but this isn't much of a book. Only 160 pages without the index and other stuff in the back, mostly self-promotion by a few architects of their own projects -- ok, some nice hotels and good color pictures in the middle -- only a little technical information.  Other books have much more content, or more pictures of a wider variety of hotels/resorts. Way too expensive for what you get 
 takes "Armis virumque" and gets "I sing of warfare and a man at war"?  The consensus in the reviews is that Fitzgerald has written a fine epic.  It just is not the same one written by Virgil.  If you want to read Fitzgerald, this is the book for you.  If you want to read Virgil you need the Mandelbaum translation 
 Oh what a tangled web we weave... when Amityville fans we try to deceive. There is so little that is appealing about this train wreck of a movie that it astonishes me to this day that someone had the nerve to pin the Amityville name on this schlock fest.   The story is downright wrong, if you can call the contrived script a story. two non believers move into the house to expose it as a simple hoax and get the surprise of their lives when they discover as others before them had, that the house is definitely not one apt to be selected for Better Homes and Gardens magazine. Sounds interesting, right? Wrong.  The performances by Roberts in particular are flat and emotionless. Only the burnt in car victim on her way to tell the unsuspecting owner of the house's true nature scene is  slightly engaging. The script is horrible, the scares are non existent, and none of the original feelings that this could be really be true are there. Its a monstrosity of epic proportions that should NEVER be viewed by any true fan of the Amityville series. Avoid this movie.... like a haunted hous 
 *warning* spoilers What an awful adaptation. The worst part was the music. Saxophone muzak and synthesizers playing in a story set in the early 1800's?????? The only character that didn't bore me to sleep was Robert Hardy's General Tilney. I had to fight to keep my eyes open on this one, and I love Jane Austen movies usually. I didn't even rent it, I borrowed it from the library. They should have paid me to take it. I don't quite understand how Catherine and Henry managed a passionate kiss at the end when throughout the movie they had no chemistry or indication whatsoever that they cared for one another. Isabella and her brother were way overdone; it was no secret to me immediately that she and her brother were the "bad guys" and part of the excitement of Jane Austen movies is the discovery that who you think is good, isn't. This is probably on my list of the ten worst movies I've seen. 
 As the story goes:  Leaving his car, a man and his friend walk down a dark lane passing under a street lamp along the way.  Upon arriving at their destination, the man discovers he has lost his keys.  He and his friend  quickly re-trace their steps and the man begins his search under the light  of the lamp.  His friend asks "why do you choose to search under the  lamp, we first walked nearly 200 meters".  He answers, "you fool,  can't you see we've been provided with light *here* !".  Even a  scholar or two can be led astray under the influence of purposeful  guidance.  Another reviewer commented, 'Microsoft is obliged to create its  own language'.  As an IS professional with a background in business  management and 20 years experience dealing with this company, I too have  labored with this language - the language of obfuscation.  This book covers  the obvious strengths of Microsoft in Research and Development.  And no one  disputes the talent attracted to this company.  However, time proves the  true direction of travel despite the claimants' insistence of a praisworthy  course.  The accurate reasons for Microsoft's success lie in ruthless,  paranoid management, expert public relations and remarkable skills at  marketing, not innovation or the development of superior products.  History  may well prove Microsoft's legacy as squandering the advantages and  qualities alluded to in this book.  Perhaps the author's would be  well-advised to supplement 'the before' with a reflective 'after' as  appropriate in the future 
 Music doesn't get any nastier than CRUNK JUICE. One of the most unusual tracks, a Rick Rubin collaboration, samples Slayer instrumentals with Jon and his East Side Boyz (who are never actually identified on the CD) screaming over them to create what may be the first-ever crunk/blues/metal hybrid in the history of rock & roll. Other songs interweave middle-eastern rhythms, soulful vocal arrangements, vivid call-and-response energy, ADD-poster-child screeching, and occasional delicate strings over Miami bass lines, electronica, and punk-rock ambiance. Chris Rock provides filthy-but-funny spoken-word cameos; Usher, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, R. Kelly, and Lil John protï¿½gï¿½ Lil Scrappy comprise only a partial list of featured helpers.  It's a testament to CRUNK JUICE'S musical integrity that the album holds up despite lyrics that, in addition to being extremely vulgar, are not especially brilliant--or even funny. What seems like it ought to sound like an immature mish-mosh of styles and performers holds together instrumentally as a terrific dance record. If only the lyrics were in a language no one could understand, we'd really have something wonderful here.   I really don't see what people get out of someone screaming the same words over and over again. Is this really what rap music has become today? Come on! 
 One of the best books I have ever read. It was engaging and informative and read like a great novel. I did not want it to end 
 Walter Mosley, like too many mainstream and mystery writers, appears to believe that "science fiction" means "logic and plausibility get tossed out the window." That the official Amazon.com review compares this book to the work of Philip K. Dick is amazing and wrong-headed; Dick knew how to ground his surrealism in the real world and especially in real human beings. Whatever Mr. Mosley does in his mysteries and mainstream fiction, that's not what he's doing here 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.      
 While it's possible it's helpful to someone somewhere to know 700 pages worth of performance measuring information, beginning at details, and ending at details, what's really needed is a simple flowchart.  If this book somewhere had just a small table saying something about acceptable measured values, and in turn what could be done to change each one, then we'd be getting somewhere.  As it is, the book's a mess.  The book gives a "starter set" of metrics, but it's on page 110, is six pages long, encompassing probably 100 measurements, and fails to note how the expected results / measurements would be at all connected to controllable factors.  From our perspective, speed was the desired result.  It appears using the authors' standpoint and methodology that to buy a new computer would be far more economical than to run all 1200 tests that are poorly explained in this book.  
 This is an amazing example of what I've only heard about heretofore:  The feminist attribution of motives that probably didn't even enter the minds of the plantation ladies Ms. Clinton has written about. Her research sample is small and perhaps overused, but quite interesting when letters are included in the text, and therefore there is some worth to the work.  Often foolish, this book says more about the author's politics than the lives of plantation mistresses 
 Rosalind Krauss' theories have some merits, and if you are looking at a book that will drive you up the wall the entire time shouting at it-- read this. I would never allow my grad students to read this dribble 
 This album has all the grammy winners but the best is Green Day's 'AMERICAN IDIOT' 
 For me this book was useful only in that it pointed out to me that there is such a thing as trailer sailing. All well and good.  However I rapidly(less than a week) out grew the book's very narrow scope, and now  have no use for it.  Would even hesitate to give to a friend because all  the boats he recommends are pretty heavy, hence require a reasonably  powerful vehicle to tow.  No where does he even acknowledge that there is a  relationship between displacement and tow vehicle size.  Most of us can't  go buy a dedicated towing machine 
 The other reviewers were right! Thank God I only borrowed the book from the public library. Had I bought it I would have demanded a refund.  Is this really Evanovich writing? Or is it mostly Hughes? I find it hard to believe that she can write this bad after reading the Plum series.  Max is ultra rich, established right away in the first chapter who thinks he knows everything there is to know. As for his car Muffin... I'm not so sure what to say about a menopausal car.  Jamie sounds dumb, like a flat character trying to find dimension.  The story, plot, etc. leaves much to be desired. Good thing they put a limit as to how low your rating can get or this would be a negative 
 This product replaces a 5 gig Creative Micro which had a hard drive and broke at 1 year after a minor drop.  The Zen V is easier to download.  The 2 gig space allows me to hold up to 5 audiobooks and some music.  The battery is lasting about 10 hours. Sound quality is better than the Micro I appreciate former comments about the unit will not lose its place if the unit is shut down while playing rather than hitting the pause/stop button, which will start at the beginning of the book or song.   I had a few encounters with the unit freezing up.  I can control the frequency  of freezes by allowing the unit to "think" after I touched a button or control.  It's a little slow to respond to the commands.  If I'm pressing a button more than once or hitting the back button command to get into the system controls, I wait until the unit gets to the window that I want before telling the unit what to do. No freezing 
 First of all - even though most of my friends hate them - I must admit that I do enjoy watching some good horror flicks. My DVD collection is also primarily concentrating on this genre. Besides classics, such as "Psycho", "The Haunting (original)", "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist", "The Omen (original)", "The Shining", "The Changeling", "Halloween", "Alien" and "The Evil Dead". I also enjoy more recent flicks, such as "The 6th Sense", "The Others", "The Ring (US version)", "The Grudge (US version)" "The Descent", "Dawn Of The Dead (Remake)" and "TCM 2003 Remake". The Problem with "The Beginning" is, that  A. the viewer knows that nobody will survive this massacre the second the movie starts. Which leads to the fact that no hero can be found in this movie! B. Nobody gets to know why Leatherface turned out this way. Damn, they could've atleast shown some flashbacks or a decent intro as e.g.in "House Of Wax". C. There is waaaay too much unnecessary gore and therefore lack of true suspense. These facts, especially the last, make this movie a over the top gorefest in the same league as "Wolf Creek", "High Tension", "Hostel" and "Saw (Sequels)". As one re-viewer stated. Horror movies should entertain by giving the viewer bonechilling suspense and a few good scares. This movie sadly couldn't succeed, due to unnecessary gore, splatter and blood. I don't need that 
 While well-written and superbly organized, this book poorly met the needs of a recent graduate looking for work outside corporate world. A downright depressing read for those looking for a first job (treated as a "special need"), this book seems primarily designed for experienced sales and marketing professionals looking to move up in the corporate world. Those considering government work, having special needs other than "too much experience", or with a short work history should consider a different guide. (Incidentally, while the book left the impression I was unemployable, after ditching Resumes for Dummies, I was called for an interview on the first job I applied for.) 
 These pillows are too soft and too small. They don't provide adequate neck support, and are more uncomfortable than the pillows I bought them to replace 
 I had "CrazySexyCool" when I was in high school and after listening to it a few times, I sold it to one of my classmates. The only songs I liked on the album were the ones released as singles. Everything else was just whatever. After "Waterfalls," TLC turned pop so quick that it made my head spin. And for as long as TLC has been out, I never cared much about T-Boz's singing. But after hearing a TLC song on the radio the other day, I realized that T-Boz sings like a croaking frog. RIBBIT 
 This my first review on Amazon but I was compelled to write based on my experience with this course. The first CD is fantastic. It starts off slow and gives you a solid foundation to build upon as you move from lesson to lesson. Within a few weeks of driving back and forth to work I had mastered all the lessons on the CD and could easily translate the English phrases in the final review lesson into Italian. I was confident and had a good grasp on building sentences and nuances such as how words changed when the subject was masculine or feminine. My opinion is that most people write their review based on the first CD.  And then I put in the second CD. I thought there was some mistake, as if I had switched to a completely different Italian course. The slow, clear speaking narrators were gone and replaced with fast talking Italians who didn't repeat anything, and certainly didn't give you time to repeat in the pause. The assumption appeared to be that I already understood the language and this was merely a refresher course. Within ten minutes I knew this was no longer the course for me. I listened to the entire second CD just in case this was all a joke and at some point they would slow down and actually help me learn Italian. No such luck! I have gone back to using the first CD for practice while I wait for the Pimsleur Italian course to arrive 
 I am writing a paper about SOA and read different books about it. In comparison to other books the Manager's Guide by Scott Green gives poor information about the SOA itself and talks about risks and controls most of the companies have realized centuries ago. In addition there are absurd comparisons to foreign laws, which maintain uselessness (for example a german law). I guess Scott Green has never been to Germany and doesn't know anything about Corporate Governance in Europe. I have traveled through Europe and found much better quality in leadership there and articles of most famous business magazins affirm my opinion.   The book is pure greed for money.   
 From what I noticed, this book comes with few examples, which I need to learn well. However, I learned the same topics originally with Calculus by James Stewart (fifth edition), which comes with very clear explanations, diagrams, and examples. Then the practice problems start off easy and then gradually increase in difficulty. Instead of Kaplan's Advanced Calculus, the James Stewart book is highly resourceful and I would recommend it to any student in calculus, because it can work for practically anyone. 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it's written in such a simplistic and unfocused way as to leave me very disappointed. The author barely scratches the surface of the many technologies/projects/events he covers, and I always felt cheated after finishing each chapter... thinking "That's IT?!"  Underground tech IS a very cool subject to write about, but the lack of information about the inner motivations and passions of these "garage warriors" leaves a glaring hole in the text. If you have a short attention span and hate to read long books, this book is easily absorbed in a few hours. This is NOT a deep exposition on underground tech; it is a quick overview for newbies. Considering that the audience for this subject would be (I assume) more literate that the national average, it's a shame that the writing seems to be limited to what a sixth-grader could easily digest.  I notice now that the price has now dropped to 10 bucks. At that price, it's more in line with the quantity/quantity of content provided, and could now be considered an "okay" value... just don't set your expectations too high. I know this was a fairly harsh review, but I really was disappointed that the amateurish quality of the writing didn't live up to the slick cover design. Don't judge a book by it's cover 
 This is the first book I have ever returned to Amazon. I was looking for a book to tell me "How To". This book is more advertising than anything else 
 I bought one of these a few months ago but unfortunately it spends a lot more time in my kitchen drawer than my regular garlic press. Here is what I do like about it:  1. The idea of whacking an unpeeled clove of garlic in order to take the skin off more easily is great, but this can be done with any hard, flat object or even the side of a chef's knife blade.  2. Unlike a garlic press, the Garlic Twist gives you uniform pieces of chopped garlic. While a garlic press leaves you with a flattened skin that you have to either discard or chop up by hand, the Garlic Twist gives you uniform pieces.  UNFORTUNATELY, and this is where the garlic press wins out by my standards, it is difficult for my lady-like hands to "get the Garlic Twist going." After the garlic has gone through a few destructive twists, it is simple enough to continue until you reach the desired size of chunks. However, the first few twists are quite difficult to execute, as you have to press the two parts together quite hard, while simultaneously turning them, to keep them from popping apart and jumping over the garlic rather than punching through it. This problem occurs even with just one clove.  Interesting idea, but the classic garlic press is still my favorite. Sometimes I grate garlic on a ginger grater or a microplane grater. For larger quantities, the Zyliss chopper might do the job but I've never tried. For the Garlic Twist, however, the drawbacks out-weigh the advantages 
 Madona is the demonstration of all the things I've learned about the bell curve. When I studied Engineering I learned that accord to "bell curve" the majority of every population is composed of mediocre people. Romans used to say "Give bread and circus to the mediocres, is the only thing they deserve". Madona is the only thing you deserve dumb people. She is mediocre and so you all. If she thinks is necessary to show her naked butt in the middle of 5th avenue to succeed she does. But I'm happy, because the best things is always reserved to superior people, and not to sheeps and mediocres followers like you 
 I asked for a popcorn popper for Christmas, and got this.  I had wanted an AIR POPPER, but maybe I wasn't specific when I asked.  Anyway, being a Cuisinart product, I thought it must be good.  Also, my cousin has an oil popper (different brand) that makes great popcorn, so I thought I'd try it.  Steam collects in the lid/bowl making wet popcorn.  Some of the popcorn burnt, even with the spinner device, because the popcorn stayed on the heat plate for too long after it popped - it can't all be on top of the pile.  I still tried to eat the finished popcorn (the unburnt, less wet pieces) and it had a terrible texture sort of too hard - stale maybe - but it was fresh corn.  Plus, even with lots of butter and salt, it had sort of a strange taste - sort of chemically maybe?  The manual even said something about chemicals needing to burn off during the first few uses (and I even washed it before I used it because of the possibility of that).  Lastly, even though it is non-stick, it was difficult to clean the cooked on oil off of the heat plate.  THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT EVER FOR SO MANY REASONS: FLAWED DESIGN, LACK IN EASE OF CLEANING, OVERALL PERFORMACE, AND THE TERRIBLE END PRODUCT!  I ended up feeding the popcorn to my dog - at least SHE seemed to like it.  I AM SERIOUSLY SHOCKED AT THE POOR QUALITY OF THIS ITEM.  I CANNOT BELIEVE CUISINART LET IT ON THE MARKET.  HOW ON EARTH DID IT PASS THEIR TEST KITCHENS?  I wanted a popcorn maker so badly and now I am stuck with a piece of junk.  Compared to that batch of popcorn, I'd rather eat the raw kernals straight out of the bag 
 I was disappointed with Dr Moody's work in this book. I found that he was departing from his usual scientific approach and perspective to something more like a sci-fi description of events that may have been nothing at all to begin with. For readers interested in the topic, I would instead recommend Hello from Heaven 
 This book is not worth the money you spend on it.  Out of twenty inputs, there are only two training ideas that are worth any time reviewing.  And, the last twenty pages have one question per page to use as icebreakers.  You could search the web and find more effective training techniques 
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
 I did the research on this product and it was one of the best. I don't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use. I have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included. One if not the only reason I had purchased it. I e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply. If your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way 
 I LOVED Shedaisy's first album The Whole Shebang.  And I also really enjoy their Christmas albumn.  They have beautiful voices and I love the three part harmonies they come up with.  I was very excited to get their newest album but I was sure dissapointed.  This is a very dark and depressing album.  Almost every song is about lost love.  Also, all the songs but 1 are slow.  Where is the upbeat Shedaisy I fell in love with???  I would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to The Whole Shebang again.  Still, I look forward to what the future may bring from them.  These sisters have alot of talent 
 Michael burned up an the doc blew up in Halloween 2, end of story, end of franchise. Money hungry producers and writers need to get a brain and think of something new. The mask is even horrible in this so called film. Rest in peace Mr Plesance, I hope God let you through the pearly gates after making such horrible sequels. Currently Rob Zombie is remaking the original Halloween, what a travisty. What next, Alice Cooper remaking Jaws or Ted Nugent remaking The Godfather. Leave classics alone 
 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Philippians 4:13  Put your faith in the bible and Gods words NOT THROUGH SHAKTI GAWAIN  Trust Jesu 
 This book is targeted for beginning writers.  I have no idea how this book would be valuable to any beginning writer in that it is convoluted, wordy and rambling. His method for writing is described in the reviews below, so I won't repeat it here.  In the book, the method's description is full of seemingly unending twists and derivations (though they really don't say all that much) and he annoyingly and frequently quotes from his own journal. How a beginning writer would learn the process of this book and then go out and find ten other people who have done the same is beyond me. I would not read this book to learn how to write.  Instead read literature, write, and repeat 
 what a rip off 150$ for this stupid book. the writers should be arreste 
 Wow this show sucks.  Bewtween the god damn overdone unfunny falling down videos (hard to think something like that is funny) to Bob Faggot (Bob Saget, nuff said), this show has sucked from the beggining.  I can't wait till this show ends.  This show never was good, all it is is some middle aged (usually) dumb*** jumping around like a retard.  This show gets stale, especially when the jokes just get so overdone, it's mind dumbing S***.  Even the funny videos are ruined by the st upid host.  Sure, this show had it's moments, but most of it is just retarded. Get Family Guy, THe Simpsons, or SOuth Park for good comedy.  Of course, you can just watch your boring stuff.  Thi 
 Awesome album.  I bought it for "Believe" but there is not a bad song on the CD.  Nice suprise of the song "Building Bridges".  I was thinking to myself that sounds like Sheryl Crow, then looked in the liner notes and it was.  Good harmony with her and Vince Gil.  
 I bought this book but didn't have time to read it until I was on the plane -- my mistake in buying it in the first place -- there are so many other great guides that do such a better job than this ridiculous guide -- the maps are horrible, the entire book is superficial in it's descriptions and the restaurants it recommends were all recommended by other guides -- as if they had plagarized the lists of places to go.  Save your money 
 I used this tub for my first born. This is small and holds very little water, therefore, the water gets cold fast! Also, there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves. It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did.   Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it's so small...when I used larger tub, that didn't happen.  One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it's compact...I kept it at my mother's house and it didn't take up much space.  I would recommend spending an extra $10 to $15 and buy a higher quality tub.  
 Berenstain Bears First Time Books usually touch upon some true to life problem that children encounter in their lives.  The stories end with some meaning, helpful solution or an understanding that maybe it's not really a  big problem.  "Mad, Mad, Mad Toy Craze" does neither of these.   The story is true to the Beanie Baby craze but there is no solution or even  an understanding at the end.  My children and myself were for the first  time truly confused and disappointed with an ending of a Berenstain Bear  book.  If the goal of the book was for the children to come up with better  ending to this story,  then we succeeded. I will still continue buying this  series but I will not recommend this book to anyone 
 To start off with, I want to say that I really loved Ilium, and had very high hopes for Olympos. But I was ultimately dissapointed. There are a number of flaws I found in the book, most of which I'll mention here.  Like another reviewer, I was hoping the focus of Olympos would be the war between the united Greeks and Trojans against the gods. To avoid spoilers I won't say much other than there is very little time given to this conflict, which I found very dissapointing.  As many other reviewers have mentioned, the book seems to build for a long time, to what the reader hopes will be some sort of epic intense conclusion, but ultimately there is barely a climax at all. Also, not all mysteries set up by the book are explained (though overall a great deal will become more clear, there are a number of unexplained bits that annoy me). Along with unexplained mysteries, there are a few points in which the motivations of characters do not make much sense.  Also, one specific conflict we are essentially promised at the end of Ilium, and is foreshadowed a number of times in Olympos, never actually occurs. The reader is supposed to accept that this sort of showdown will probably happen at some point after the events of the book.   Olympos also lacks the intensity and action of Ilium. I remember reading the last 300 pages of Ilium in one sitting because  I was so enthralled. Olympos never reaches this level. In fact, by the end I was already dissapointed enough that I practically had to force myself to finish it.  One final thing that bothered me were a number of anti-Islam and homophobic bits that really add nothing to the story. They were essentially purposeless, yet they were there. At one point near the end homosexuality is described as if it was just some psychological disease existing only in the 21st century. This passage comes from nowhere, and like I said, serves no purpose.   While I still think Ilium was an amazing book, this sequal did not come close to meeting its promise 
 Didn't care for this book at all.  If you want to learn about Stephen King you'd be much better off reading or listening to his book "On Writing.&quot 
 If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.  As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else 
 I had to return this.  The poetry in the book was very nice, but the pictures were too abstract I think for a preschooler to grasp, and not particularly compelling for me as an adult who not only uses preschool nature books professionally but also collects them as a hobby.  
 This is the most boring book I've read in the series! I've read all her books and I couldn't wait to finish this one. I can't believe I finished it in the first place! It has no plot and you can tell who did it very early in the storyline (if you want to call it a storyline). I wouldn't waste money buying this one. Get it from your library! The rumors about this one being ghostwritten have got to be true. I can't imagine Braun writing like this! 
 Although I am a huge fan of Jo Beverly, this was a disappointment. It is very hard to identify Damaris' finer qualities and start to care about her, so one wonders why Fitz would care. Also, although certainly anyone who reads romance novels cannot be a prude, it does seem a little strange--dare I say forward?--the way Damaris throws herself at Fitz and starts kissing him hotly every time they are alone. Ashart and Genova also seem to take over the book quite a bit. And yet one more quibble--Damaris' family situation turns out to be so bizarre that it just beggars belief (although the Trayce family mystery is quite fun). All in all, not one of Beverly's best 
 I bought this hand mixer based on the quality implied by the Cuisinart name -- I had had their processor for over 20 years.  Huge mistake.  Cuisinart's quality has gone downhill in those 20 years.  This mixer lasted barely a year, diving downward the entire year but not so far as to call in a warrenty claim.  (Besides, I had had to deal with Cuisinart's so-called customer service in getting a worn-down part for the food processor, and didn't have the heart to try that again.  They berate you for "misusing" their products -- even if you're not complaining and it is only a wear issue.  Weird.)  Anyway, this mixer is done for.  It was never able to handle cookie dough, so I never asked it to after a couple of tries.  They offer a dough hook, but that's fiction.  Don't buy it.  Don't try it. Walk the other way.  (PS:  I was so blinded I thought it was just me and not Cuisinart, and replaced the old, worn food processor a few months ago with a new Cuisinart.  Anyway, the new supposedly equivalent processor is a total bust.  Very weak.  I can't believe it.  So Cuisinart has dropped off my list of reliable companies.  Too bad.  That old processor was really good for 20 years of hard use. 
 I am surprised that so many gave this color book a good review.  It has very few pages, and was a disappointment to me.  I wish I had bought a thicker one, as Ihad to purchase another gift, just so this one wouldn't look so cheap 
 For trying to be a popular exposition on mathematics Devlin's book is too difficult for the lay reader. Unless you have university level mathematics in your luggage you won't understand much. The explanations of basic conepts are missing, the proofs are not there and the history is condensed into a few pages. Thus if your mathematical imagination cannot fill in these gaps you will not extract much pleasure from this book. You will rather be frustrated. I myself have read mathematics at the university and still couldn't follow him everywhere. The problem is that the labeling of the book is misleading. This is not a book of popularized mathematics. This is leizure time reading for mathematics professors and math-freaks. If you want to read something that is easy to understand but still interesting try some of the American Mathematical Society's wonderful publications (you can find them all on amazon). 
 First of all, before anyone immediately rushes to deem this review "unhelpful", let me describe something.  The concept of this soundtrack is amazing in it's right.  There are majour highlights to this cd which excel past things which other soundtracks are trailing behind in.  However, it is not a perfect cd.    The highlight of the score begins immediately and sets hopes for you to expect.  "Dead Already", despite the ill-sounding name, is a playful track with a great xylophone-marimba tune with an odd sound aiding it in the background.  At first, when things start getting better, Newman introduces his secret weapon: the foreign percussion which he uses.  I have let some of my friends hear this, both foreign and not foreign, and all have agreed on the excellent usage of this for the single opening and ending (which is generally the exact same thing with few differences) tracks.  However, this expectation that was laid down never really fufills itself.  Instead, we have a drone of tracks which sound excellent for about twenty seconds...then become repetitive and warranting a skip.  They all have nice tunes and occassionally a piano theme, but never really go beyond and aadd anything worthwhile.  In track 8, American Beauty, we are given a soothing, gentle piano and strings joint, with one of the most relaxing themes I've heard to date.  The track drones on, but is still a great listen - had it been a bit shorter, it would have been perfect.  This brought the standard up a bit, but then we still have the same repetitive music again later.  "Choking the Bishop", while it worked for the movie, is extremely difficult to listen to.  Finally, "Any Other Name" and "Still Dead" gives us what we already heard, almost exactly to the point.    My basic point is that the concept for this soundtrack is superb, but it has poor execution.  For the film, it works spectacularly, but as a sole soundtrack, it doesn't live up to what it could produce potentially.  However, the few minutes of excellent music we do get to hear is enough to warrant a reccomendation from me, but I will only give it two stars in it's overall presentation 
 In the book introduction the author correctly states that most regexp texts and tutorial tend to concentrate just on the "easy" part: regexp syntax illustrated with a few examples, and do not give the reader even a little mastery in the art of using them. He then proceeds to writing another short and sweet useless syntax illustration. This "book" has no more useful material than you can find in a free web tutorial, so I suggest you save your money and stick with those, or go for a book that's worth some money: "Mastering Regular Expressions" by O' Reilly 
 A book on a truly fascinating topic, plagued by sloppy copy editing and proof reading, and enough errors to make it annoying to any reader who knows how to use grammer, grommar, or whatever they call that. How disappointing 
 Buy the Baby Bjorn before you waste your time and money on this hunk of junk.  No matter how I tried, I couldn't wrap my baby to where I felt he was secure and safe and comfortable.  Plus, it took forever and my baby had no patience to wait for me.  By the time he was in, he wanted out 
 for the price of the rebate, it is a good deal. Though don't expect you get an easy use of the case, especially all 96 discs are in case. With a big force to squeeze the case together, finally able to zip it, and you will get probably all the disc bent especially the outer sleeve ones It is a bad design by having the same dimesion sleeves sew together in the center. Probably having 48 discs case would be more proper instead of 96 disc 
 In my opinion this book is poorly written, unorganized and difficult to understand.  There are grammatical errors, discussions that refer to unprinted schematics, and numerous typos.  If you are a Stamp expert, I guess this book would be of great value for the schematics alone, but for anyone trying to grasp advanced basic stamp concepts, leave this book on the shelf.  
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 This book is so poorly written it's actually funny. Cook's verbose, pointless descriptions, his banal, clumsy dialogue, and his generally tactless, maladroit writing makes reading this book a complete waste of time. The story? It doesn't matter because Cook's ineptitude as a writer completely overshadows any merits it may have. If you consider yourself intelligent, you should not even open this book 
 This is for just one collar. This is not for a complete system, it is for one extra collar 
 I was very disappointed with this book and can not recommend it.  I think that Morgan Freeman is a very dynamic actor.  I enjoy his performances in every movie he had a part in.  I read a lot of biographical books.  A good one will leaving you feeling like you have had a one-on-one conversation about one's life journey.  I felt that this book should have been marketed as a behind the movie scenes type of book.  Either Mr. Freeman was being parsimonious with his biography or Kathleen Tracy just could not get him to share.  Even the "behind the movie scenes" info was slow and boring.  However, Mr. Freeman some of your fans (like me) really want to know more about you, your journey, and pearls of wisdom.  I look forward to another biographical book about you in the future.

 These dishes are everything they say they are EXCEPT the embossed pattern does not in any way, shape, or form resemble a fleur-de-lis, but rather looks much like a scorpion or bug, complete with a body and legs. The smaller pattern in between the insects resembles a marijuana leaf. So...if you want to impress guests with bugs and pot leaves on your serveware this is the set for you 
 I am a software engineer and I like to read about other sciences, but this book has disappointed me to have ideas about neuroscience. In my reading experience I found it as the most confusing book, the author talks about his life more than the science indicated in the title of the book. 
 By far nothing comparable to Javier Solis. Not taking anything away from the tenor of OPERA not Ranchera...Lets leave the rancheras for those who are gifted in its style.  You want real rancheras listen to MR. Javier Solis 
 If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point.  Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated.  He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory.  Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I agree with the other reviewers that the first 3 books were a treat.  This book is terrible.  The reviewers hit all the weaknesses but were too kind.  No action, slow drawn out plot.  Too many characters and too little chacter development. Sigh, we were so disappointed 
 I had high hopes for this book based on the subject matter. The book was nothing like I expected. It reads like a 10 year old's term paper. If that is the target audience then the book is a success. However if you graduated from grade school then you will probably be disappointe 
 I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one.   Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.   This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.   That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book.   Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.   Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.   They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered "scary" is with the cheap haunted-house "BOO!" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.   Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film.  Let's hope the 2008 re-make is better. 
 I bought this book based on glowing reviews by a majority of readers; Ann Rule was touted as an outstanding writer.  I found this book to be about as gripping as a newspaper article.  Dull and  boring.  Sorry, Ann Rule fans.  Now I am trying another of her books "Every Breath You Take, and it is starting off even worse.  I hope it gets better or my review on that one will be another grudging one star. 
 the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens, very disapointtin 
 Just received two of these. Yes, how dumb of me to buy two not knowing much about it.  The quality of the casing is really poor.  The plastic is very flimsy feeling.  The labels were all half-way peeled off upon opening the box. They show signs of just simply being really old.  The instructions are written in many languages which is fine, but there are things they fail to tell you.  I also ordered the Juice AA 4 pack and 2 of the batteries arrived dead. The charger blinks red with those batteries, but the instructions do not even bother telling you what a blinking red light means.    If you go to the juicebattery website, they do not mention this product anywhere.  Not even when you search for it. A good chance this is a fly-by discontinued product.  The company themselves have not responded to by blinking light question for 3 days now.    As with many things, made in CHINA!  I got a few more days yet before I need to return them via Amazon's return policy which as we all know, ROCKS!  
 I can't follow the bandwagon of congratulations for Joe Dante's MOH episode; this is unfortunate because Joe is one of my heroes. I respect that it sets out to do exactly what Joe and co. wanted it to do, but in the end it comes off as more of an indictment of Anne Cultor than it does the Iraq War. But it isn't the politics that left me wanting in this particular film, it was the fact that Dante was able to make a balls-to-the-wall horror movie again (THE HOWLING being a particular favorite of mine), but that isn't at all what we get. In some ways it seems silly to complain, given that the war is true horror; but Dante is a monsterkid, and I was really hoping for something else. Again, I respect his decision and his choices with this particular story, I was just hoping for something a little more fun. Shallow perhaps, but I'm a B-movie maven all the way. I'm happy that he has received good notices for this episode (Dante is super underrated), and definitely recommend it to those who are not really horror, or B-movie, fans, who are looking for something with a little more substance. The film is well made, and very humorous (only Dante would crank the gag of having famous "zombie" directors names' littering a group of headstones up a notch by adding Del Tenney!), and I recommend it to those not looking for a "horror" movie 
 Not sure what happened, but I received my daughter's gift in the mail today. There were no penguins in the box, and but the packaging looked original with no tampering. Beware, if you're ordering from Imaginarium! What a disappointment this was for us 
 This book was perfectly awful. If it was possible I would have givin it zero stars. I am in the eighth grade and none of the people in my school act like this.  People might be thinking this but don't actually say it out loud.  This book was also degrading towards both boys and girls.  The one charactor in this book who I actually liked was Marcaline.  I don't recomend this book for people of of any age and anyone under 15 should absolutly not read it!  Save yourself the time and put this book where it belongs.  In the trash can 
 Probably this book went way over my head.   The one insight I think I got from it was that during the tech boom, many of the new products were appearing, not because of some fundamental increase in the rate of innovation brought on by the Web, but because of all the money pouring into startups because investors believed the Web would lead to such innovations for technological reasons. A phenomena Soros calls "reflexivity", I guess. But even without knowing that it seemed clear a boom was in progress that would eventually bust. But how to know when? It doesn't seem this book or Soros could tell you.  I hear Soros became a billionaire through his investments and that seemed well beyond a chance event, but I didn't understand  anything in this book to explain how that happened. Speculations about global politics and finance, then a big dash of intuition, and then at times a gain, at times a loss. I don't follow in Soros's case why his gains exceeded his losses. There are others who don't believe in unbiased marketes, why didn't they similarly profit to such an extent. And just knowing that markets are biased, how does it tell you how to time? Perhaps Soros benefitted from adjusting his market positions quickly if his assumptions weren't confirmed by the market: would that help and to such an extent?  It's not clear to me that Soros' explanations in this book are closely related, if at all, to his successes. It may be helpful to be exposed to his mindset, if this book does that, but, after  finishing it, it isn't clear how to apply what I've read. I won't not recommend this book, because I may very well be missing a lot of what it says. Other people's books may not make you a billionaire. But I haven't figured out whether this one will make me one or even allow me to pay for a new car. "The Alchemy of Finance" seems to be about bold gambling I wouldn't want to do with any money I may someday need.      
 Not all sections are included.  Only one or two solutions per section.  Very rarely they'll have an extra sentence or so of explanation, but that's about it 
 This movie forgets that it's an exploitation movie and tries to much to be a crappy war movie. Waaaaay too much time is spent on the escapades of the partisans and not enough on sleazy exploitation. Ilsa, she-wolf of the SS is much better! While there are a couple memorably campy scenes with the beast ( ala his version of a fur burger ) it's not enough to merrit a purchase. Avoid

 Rather sad book which draws on his erudition and his personal experience. The background is interesting, but when he describes his experience with his mother`s decline and death, for me he descends into unconvincing  sentimentality. I guess he should stick to the academic writing he is  undoubtedly skilled in, as those are the best parts of the book. Little  genuine experience of the relationship of the physical to the spiritual  desert comes through for me with any conviction. I`m glad he survived;but  it doesn`t share enough of his experience to enlighten me 
 There are very few serious articles in this magazine-- just tons of tidbits (stats/facts/tips). By the time you get to the end it's difficult to recall anything from the magazine; it's that shallow.  Occasionally there's a good recipe, but that's about it 
 I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.  In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book. Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing 
 It might not have been that widely reported in the press but when Disney was releasing this movie, Warner Brothers and DC Comics was up in arms over the title and direction that this so called movie on the life of George Reeves was taken, so to avoid legel difficulties, the movie was edited and it's title was changed to avoid court proceedings.  Aside from that this is a tasteless movie about the life of an actor who ment much to the generation of Superman readers who watched the TV show (the offical verdict of history is that the actor's death was a suicide and this tasteless movie does nothing to change or prove otherwise).  George Reeves should be remembered more for the part he played on film and leave his private life alone.  Case Closed 
 Mine worked good enough for window cleaning until it stopped making steam after first on-and-off 30 min use 
 This book is quite old and deals with topics that can be found in lots of corporate finance books such as pv and fv. You can't see the contents of the book either. If you have or know of the Fabozzi book then get that instead.  
 I can only say that the effort was obvious but the information was hard to use.The research was solid but lacked common usage for slugs like me 
 Dr. Lowry does an excellent job discussing the diseases and treatments of syphilis and gonorrhea and that alone makes the book worth buying.  However with about 20 entries of venereal diseases in the journals he manages to misinterpret some of the entries, provides misleading information and some of his conclusions are not suportable by the entries in the journals.

  Britney is sadly targeted in the media. And no I do not think she's a bad mother. The only problem is that she can't write a decent song to save her life. She's no Madonna or Janet. They at least add creativeness to their songs and perform them well. Want proof? Get Madonna's Like A Prayer or J's Rhythm Nation. Back to the product. There's nothing remotely different from her first effort. I mean nothing. And the worst part is that she covered a Rolling Stones classic. I'm surprised Mick and Keith didn't shoot her down for it. Well, they did get their money. Stronger is ear poison to the fullest and the rest of the singles...pure MTV garbage. She's one of the reasons why MTV is going down hill. A great album from 2000 that you all should check out is Erykah Badu's Mama's Gun. If you disagree, then you are officially brainwashed by MTV 
 I'm so glad we didn't buy a subscription to National Geographic Kids magazine without checking it out at the news stand first! It truly seemed like there were more pages of ads than of actual CONTENT in this magazine.  If you're looking for a good kids' magazine about nature & wildlife, try one of the National Wildlife Federation's excellent publications. My kids enjoy Your Big Backyard (for ages 3-7) and Ranger Rick (for kids 7 & up), both of which are available through Amazon.com or [...]  Kids Discover magazine (for 6-12 year olds) is another favorite with my children (and me) and contains great science & social studies articles without the commercials of NG Kids. You can subscribe through Amazon or [... 
 I am soooo glad that I checked this out of the library and didn't pay for this garbage. I really should of listened to the reviews on this book before I wasted a day reading it. Actually, about half-way through I skimmed. The first couple chapters weren't bad, but the rest was just awful.  Gracie, her ex-husband, her friends...they are the most pathetic, shallow bunch of fakes I've ever read about. What's even worse is that's the authors real life (maybe not the divorce part, but the rest of it).   In the end, all I have to say is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! I should of listened to the others, but I didn't, and now I regret that I wasted so much time when I could of been reading something worth while. 
 Do you feel different from people around you?  Do they resent your ingenuity?  Have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs?  Do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth?  Congratulations!  You are either in the aryan nations or the Clan of the Cave Bear fan club, possibly both!  (I exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century English settler in Australia, or a Boer in South Africa, or maybe you just like Larry Niven, but that's beside the point)  I can forgive Auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book.  In the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of Neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at Wikipedia.  Ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and Auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion.  Similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor.  I haven't read her more recent works, but I imagine she has probably improved.  Even with the pendulous sentences Clan is not unreadable.  What infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged.  The story reads like a near-literal historicization of Helena Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine on the fall of the "aryans"- who interbred with "subhumans" introducing the world to, oh I dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture.  Of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed Ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug.  Against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression.  I would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give Auel's books a wide berth.  Also?  Enough rape scenes already 
 Queenan wasted his trip and my money. It's no wonder his wife stayed home. Queenan learned little or nothing about the REAL Britain. He is egotistical and pretentious, and his prose leans toward the turgid, repetitive and flatulent. Perhaps he thinks he's funny, though in truth, to use his own terminology, he's nothing but a wanker. Stick with Theroux and Bryson if you want to enjoy your travels.   
 This album contains only rap and no rock songs.  This was very disappointing to say the least 
 Okay, I'm going to go against the grain here and say that Suttree really isn't all that good.  Maybe it's fine literature -- although personally I don't think so; I think literature should engage and tell a story that the reader can feel part of, absorbed into with a pathos for its characters, good or bad.  Here we get only snatches of that.  *At times* we feel akin to Suttree.  For example the prison segment is good; there is a sense of purpose and pace here absent from the rest of the book; but on the whole Suttree is a rambling and confusing mess.  Why struggle so much with a book?  It's not that the ideas are so incredibly complex -- sure, at times it's sublime -- but it has a purposefully disconnected storyline.  The reader is meant to feel in the dark and only slowly pick up on the context and setting of the scenes.  The relationship between Suttree and Harrogate is great, but there needs to be more of it -- I feel like saying "yeah, yeah, yeah, just bring me back to the friendship between those two and give us more development of Suttree's mysterious past."  If you want to read this, you have been warned.  You will probably be bored and frustrated a good deal of the time.  Page after page of how someone shaves or combs their hair sound interesting?  If you think it's worth it "in the name of literature", then that's up to you.    Note: I have read Blood Meridian and thought it was an excellent book: definitely go read that one first.  And I read A Child of God, which was also great.  I was hoping to become more of a Cormac McCarthy fan reading this one, but I think I've gotten to the point where I'd rather read the back of my shampoo bottle or peruse my way through a stack of disclaimer forms.  McCarthy is a master of the language, no doubt.  But in order to make us read the book he ought to at least make it interesting 
       Never before has such a poorly written book received such acclaim. Maya Angelou wrote this story not with candor and grace but with a bias rarely allowed to sit on shelves let alone the top of a best-seller list. She was not humorous but had a heinousness of character and action that places her beyond the limits of human pity. This "inspiring author" did not demonstrate poignancy and depth but the crude rudiments of writing skill below that found in the essays of a primary school student.               Maya Angelou has portrayed herself as a victim of fate and yet at best her actions can only be described as foolhardy. In an attempt to prove to herself that she isn't a lesbian (a term she apparently doesn't understand) she initiates a deed without thinking of the consequences. She repeatedly gratifies her ego by exalting her academic accomplishments, yet doesn't grasp the fallacies of her own actions until it is far too late.             Several fans have seen her as an example to women. I must disagree with this ardently. Every teenage girl using her as a role model and demonstrating such lack of forethought puts herself at risk for sexual assualt, neglect, STDs, and teen pregnancy.             My only hope for this book is a quick and discreet cremation. May her name never be mentioned in the same breath as Margaret Atwood or any other great modern writer of either gender, and ANY nationality 
 This is a very poor remake of a very good movie.  The character changes and the story line changes were very weak.  It was just plain bad.  Even if it was made to be a sequel instead of a remake, the characters were not strong enough to make it an exciting movie.  And the ending - there was no comparison of the "signature moves" on the Olympic performance with the original movie.  Don't waste your time and money on this one 
 I don't get why this CD is such a big deal other than it was the first CD that Massive attack released. I consider myself a massive attack fan, but it just sounds very outdated to me. Don't get me wrong. There are a few songs that point to group becoming excellent in the future. Five man Army is great. So is blue lines, and Safe from harm is alright for sounding like early 90's dance, but other than that I didn't care for it.   
 I was unable to finish this book due to the glaring errors and poor craftsmanship.  I should have realized that any author who listed People magazine as a model of respected journalism was not to be trusted; still, I let my curiosity get the best of me.  Finally, I determined that I could, in fact, be reading ONLY what could be described as an UN-authorized biography; and a re-read of the front cover of the book confirmed my desperate diagnosis.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but this book stinks; it reads like a ghastly farce of a paper cut-n-copy fan-zine.  I should like to see what a more capable author (not to mention editor and proofreader) would do with such interesting material 
 I usually like this author and have read almost all of her books; however, after reading this book I definitely felt cheated. The book is well written, and the characters were pleasing, although I thought Faith was not being true to her character as presented in earlier books in the series. Agatha Christie used to say that a mystery writer must play fair with his or her readers. All of the evidence and the clues must be laid out for the reader to try to solve the mystery before the author resolves it. To do otherwise is to cheat the reader who has invested time in reading the book. No reader had a chance to solve this mystery unless by sheer guessing. Once the murderer is revealed, the reader realizes that it really could have been anyone, and all the clues have meant nothing. I was very disappointed, so I will think twice about getting any of her new books 
 Way way too much science at the expense of what could have been a great story about the vanishing cranes.  I read a lot of excellent literature but this book taxed my brain and not in a good way.  I was sick of all the characters by books end. There was not one redeeming quality in any of them. I simply cannot imagine how this book could win any awards 
 Bennett makes few if any good points in this book about the problems our culture faces.  Most of the book is spent showing how many people were "critics" and how he showed them who was boss.  Bennett criticizes anyone who wishes to include diversity in the American life: through "controversial" art which he deems a "bad joke" simply because it may shock viewers, through a desire for schooling that does not impose Christian ideals upon its students by force, through courses that don't only include dead white men of the western world, etc.  Bennett's argument is that his racist, homophobic, beauraucratic, Christian-supremicist version of morality is the only feasible one and must be imposed upon all children in any institution of education.  He spends most of the book laughing off his critics and indignantly ignoring any of their points, casting them off as just being jealous that their plans aren't as good as his.  Yet he thinks vouchers will help poor students, that an abolishment of affirmative action will help minorities, and that "beheading" drug dealers is morally plausible.  The section on drugs has a little bit of insight, but the books few good points are obscured by his blatant arrogance and conservative ideals 
 It's very good, and I only give it one star because my teacher ruined it for me.  She analyzed everything Arthur Miller wrote in it, whether the lights were to be dark, or bright, how he shift time, how the instruments played, believing symbols of all of them.  Contrary to Arthur Millers own statements which I printed out and gave to the class, that he didn't plan on anything, he just wrote.  Let people do with it what they do.  In that affect, the teacher took a great play, and ruined it with her ideas of what he meant.  
 Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45 
 This is a big thick paperback book, that you might think goes into great detail and has a lot of descriptions. Unfortunatly, there is just some background and and brief descriptions of different things. Also, almost half the book is devoted to a glossary. If you want to find out about sand casting, "The complete Sand Casting Manual" also written by him though still not complete, is the book for you 
 I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know 
 I'm not surprised to read a lot of kid reviews on this CD.  This reminds me of what I used to listen to when I was 13 and didn't have much expectations for my music. These are 5 girls who a producer to make them a hit single which made them superstars overnight. They make music for the masses and probably will rank high as they already have accomplished a fanbase (consisting mostly of young girls I would assume) as they choose safe songs, but if you're looking for quality music with well-written and meaningful ("good love will always come from me" "we're in fashion don't you know" "summer in the city and the sun is high") lyrics you should be listening to something else. This is also the reason they will not break throgh in the US with this album.  The CD starts off with a cool intro, followed by an up-tempo tune (which will get stuck on your brain after enough listens)about the shallow girls on the street (referred to as MODELS, but the lyrics are amazingly poor. Next is the mid-tempo much-raved-about BIOLOGY (about their act/appearance/biology), but I can't see why; other than the fact that if you listen to a song enough you will end up liking it. Wild horses follow in the same lead.. (a past relationship which was hard to get out of, but now wild horses can't make her go back) it's just OK. SEE THE DAY is a catchy mid-tempo ballad about trying to convince a guy she's worth a try and not like everyone else he's dated before. WATCH ME GO is a naughty up-beat tune about doing her thing and giving it all to her man. The tune reminds a lot of something that could be on a Sugababe album which means you can dance to it; one of the better songs on the album. WAITING is (!) about a girl waiting for the boy she wants and the pain she had to go through. The song is mid-tempo, but there's no catchy tune and is basically just an album filler. WHOLE LOTTA HISTORY is IMO the best track on this CD. It's a catchy, heartbreaking ballad ("is she really that beautiful?") about breaking up and the boy finding a new love. LONG HOT SUMMER is a poor up-tempo track about a (!) long hot summer and that's pretty much it. SWINGING LONDON TOWN is not really a song; it sounds so electronica with loud music and some weird vocals in the background about the queen of england and other london stuff that make no sense. IT'S MAGIC is a (very) boring mid-tempo tune about love that you've heard a dozen times before "you're in my thoughts all the time". NO REGRETS is a safe ballad that you have heard a million times before, this time with a spanish feel to it, but yet again no lyrics to back it up. To finish off the CD they've chosen RACY LACY; a mid-tempo song with lyrics about this girl who makes spreading her legs into a sport. This is 10th grade locker-room chatter, but seems a bit too childish to have on this CD and the melody does not do the lyrics any justice. This would only work as a power song and sadly it isn't.  I will give it two stars for Whole Lotta History and Watch Me Go 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 We got this for my son. We had it for 2 months. When he would get excited and try to Bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard Toys. Last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth. It was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me. Nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth. Over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much. He lost the tooth on the 8th days. When he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root. Now he will be with out a tooth for 4-6 years. Please choose another product for your child. It's not worth the risk 
 Being a student of photojournalizm in Moscow, Russia, I looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available. I had studied one book on the subject by the russian author, but knowing that photography in the US is much more developed and professional I was striving to get a book by a professional photographer.  I was disappointed by the book "Photographic Composition" by Tom Grill for a number of reasons:  1. It does not cover all important compositional elements, and those that it covers are not explained in full detail. It does not explain: - how elements with the similar shapes, similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other,  - the reverse perspective effect and its uses, - why right and left sides of the photograph differ and why, how it can be used on practice, - how to balance "weight" of different elements of the photograph, it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect example, - difference between compositional center and the center of interest, how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo (does not match each other) - all signs of perspective, it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective (trivial as it may sound, it still should be marked in any complete work, especially when the author covers other three elements) - and much much more.  2. It does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic, neither does it show how composition works in art, which I believe is very important.  3. Most examples are in color, while most ideas on composition are best explained using B&W photographs.  4. Last but not least, composition is about meaning, making a message, not just how to balance different elements within a frame. The book makes this statement, but in my opinion fails to provide poverful examples, while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good.  OVERALL: I believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations, not just a few and briefly explained "how-to-quickly-improve-any-photo-you-take". This books fails to provide complete approach to composition and at times can be misleading.  I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me (and other folks that look at our reviews) a more thorough book on composition, I'm sure there must be a good book in english on that subject. Thanks!  P.S. For those who can read in russian I advise a book by A. Lapin "Fotografiya kak..", which compared to the book by Tom Grill explains composition in full 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 Should Martha Rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a "business decision"? I would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this "criminal spectacle" designed to make the question of Martha/Mdiddy's innocence a moot point. Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? How important is integrity to a leader...former CEO of a company? Be "thoughtful 
 While I'm not the type who notes inaccuracies very well, it was the story that bothered me most. Nevermind that many writers these days have serious problems with prose.   I had a very hard time trying to convince myself that a forensic pathologist could be rambling endlessly about "evil". All this with hardly any conscience over having an affair with Benton and sullying his marriage.   Furthermore, Patricia Cornwell pulls out the old trick of "men versus Scarpetta" again. While it was vaguely interesting in the first book or so, this constant reminder is tiring.   Finally, the "conspiracy" part has been beaten to death. It doesn't mean you can't use it though but Patricia employs it to poor effect.   I felt that Cruel and Unusual and The Body Farm were the better books out of this series. I think she has finally worn out her characters and they would've been better laid to rest. 
 I'm surprised at all the good reviews this book got. Not to be snide, I just genuinely am.   This book looms in my memory as the one book I had to drag myself to finish. A book that made me tear up with boredom. The plucky heroine wasn't likable, the names were all forced and strange (none making sense in a universe together--more like an assortment of characters from different books) , not on the unique side, really.  I thought any originality forced and unfounded, and wished it would have turned out better for me, especially as the "magic dust" theory was such a nice start.  The ending wasn't predictable, but it was trying so very hard NOT to be, it couldn't possibly have been anything but what it was: Dull.  With all these good reviews, and me not having read it in years, it might be worth trying, but I stand firm: take it out of the library 
 I spent the first two chapters of this book thinking I had accidentally repurchased the previous title. Hated chef dead vs hated wedding planner dead at wedding. Annabelle argued with each of them just before they died, sexy policeman turns up and patronises. Silly caterer thinks he will get the blame. Sillier assistant gets even sillier. Etc etc etc. BORING! 
 This was the first Madeline Hunter book that I have bought and read. From the reviews on here, I expected to find a highly engrossing historical romance story, but instead, this book just drags on, and gets tedious and boring. The storyline is lacking. And the characters are not likable. I couldn't even finish this book. Not a keeper. 
 Nothing about these stories is horror, or even scary. I wasn't expecting gore or extreme horror, or even Victorian ghost stories.  But there wasn't a single good story in this bunch of duds.  And certainly NOT the supernatural or anything you'd get from reading the back of the bookcover.  This book literally would put me to sleep.  Boy, there are MUCH better short story collections out there in this genre.   This black book is worse than Possession which I found grossly over-rated.  Anything by this author is horrible and only the literary types seem to like her work.  
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 NATURE UNLEASHED has given us avalanches, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanoes and now fire.  This is probably the least effective of the series.  The villain is a Michael Myers like creature out for revenge on the park ranger who prevented him from stealing gold from a wornout mine.  The fire scenes are CGI crafted and aren't that impressive; most of the characters are cardboard and not too likeable and "star" Bryan Gennesse chews up the scenery badly.  For firebugs only 
 Followed all directions, added fish, within hours the fish were "sleeping" on the bottom of the tank. Luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so I took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better.  Changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water, added fish, 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom.  took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better. Something is seriously wrong with this tank.  Bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what... they are doing great!  Do not put fish in the shark tank.  They will die 
 This book is not good. The author's style is good but the story goes nowhere.  The characters in the book are really more parodies of people rather than being fully developed.   Waste of time 
 I bought this camera a year ago, the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light, but for using indoor (with flash) is very, very bad. When you use flash the photo are not good, but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice, if you can bought another camera. 
 Carter's attempt to trace the disingenuous way in which many Americans have forsaken their moral compass in favor of political labels and bumper-sticker-grade philosophy is just about on target.  His prescribed fixes, however, are little more than just the sort of swell-sounding but essentially empty rhetoric which he is skewering. While Carter promises a new approach to integrity in American life, all he seems to have on tap is a lot of quotations and circular logic.  "We can learn to do right by doing the right thing, or listening to the right people," he seems to say, without ever providing a really supportable definition of those terms.  Instead, he depends on his own, completely subjective, ideas of right and wrong, which don't convince.  His appeals to group ethics are slightly more useful, but fall prey to the same critiques he is leveling at what he calls "media culture" and other left-wing "evils." Political hackwork.  
 Just finished reading this novel this morning and I think it is probably the weakest one of the lot.  Like a lot of reviewers, I didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the Stephanie Plum series.  As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date.  It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all.  I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me.  There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive.  I still think there is a spark of life in the Stephanie Plum series, but I hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one 
 The best way to begin is to show you where I stand. I think "Zombie Island" and "The Witch's Ghost" were excellent. I didn't much care for "Alien Invasion" or "Cyber Chase." I thought "The Legend of the Vampire" was a surprisingly good return to form. Onto chapter six. I can't really say this is one of Scooby's better movies. It kind of lacks the punch and surprises of "Zombie Island" and "The Witch's Ghost." Instead of the scarey surprises seen in the first two movies, this 6th chapter seems to rely more on silly chases. (But if you like the original episodes, you probably won't mind that so much.) Also, in my opinion, the script is weaker which means the movie seems very long and drawn out. ("Zombie Island" and "Witch's Ghost" don't seem to have many dull moments at all.) And, I won't say too much here, but when the mystery is uncovered and you really didn't get to know the culprit in the first place, a certain edge is missing. (In "Zombie Island" and "Witch's Ghost," we got to know the culprits very well in the 1st half of the movie, and therefore, there was  a scarey sense of recognition when the plots were uncovered. The main reason I can give to watch this movie is that it was at least nice to the original line up from the early cartoons (Casey Kasem-Shaggy, Frank Welker-Fred, Heather North-Daphne, and Nicole Jaffee-Velmah) together again. The movie is worth some interest, but it's more of a long episode. If you like Scooby, this movie is watchable. But, don't expect the terror, intensity, and suspense of "Zombie Island," "The Witch's Ghost," or even "Legend of the Vampire."           
      Mutation, New York Times best seller, written by Robin Cook a medical trainee at Harvard, is a book with plots up to ears and turns and twist to your eyes. Very well written but has far too many plots. I got bored very easily and got mad at the book in several different parts. The plots were supposed to be suspenseful but it was very predictable which made it boring. However well written this book is I do not recommend it to anybod 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 This product is nice at first but you'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you don't have to put anymore holes in your home.  I've bought 5 of them over 4 years.  We have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking.  DO NOT BUY, buy something better and higher quality so that you won't have to replace in 6 months.  PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW.  IT WILL SAVE YOU 
 Knowing the author by name and by reputation, I borrowed this book from a friend rather than contributing to him financially by paying for it.  It's just the kind of pseudo-scientific garbage I'd expect when someone schooled in Philosophy is allowed to write a book on a scientific topic.  The serious question of whether - and to what degree - nonhuman animals experience emotion should be entered into not only with skepticism, but with knowledge of how Science should be carried out, and how to go about evaluating the data that results.  Masson is qualified to do NONE of these, and seems utterly unaware of that handicap.  It's precisely what I'd expect from someone who romanticizes the barbaric acts of the Animal Liberation Front, however, a terrorist group that firebombs research facilities and university labs, then enters high schools and teaches those same tactics to our children.  To my mine, Masson should share a prison cell for supporting them in his idiotic writings 
 A shame that Mr. Garrett had absolutely no writing talent at all, because the book could be good, dealing about one of the greatest legendsof all times 
 NOWHERE THIS CD SUCKS, I TOTALLY HATED IT, IF YOU LIKE LOUSY SOUNDING EVERYTHING DEN BUY IT, BE A DUMMY DUMMY PURPLE PEOPLE EATER DIE DIE DI 
 I'm not sure who is rating this but my expectations were high for this toy based on all these raters giving this gadget 5 stars. I'm sorry to say that I don't think so. You cannot use it as a voice changer without having to record something each time. There are other voice changers that allow you to add voice effects as you speak. Not this one. That reduces the fun effect. The microphone doesn't capture the voice that well and the speakers are weak. I had to play it near someone's ear for them to hear it or tell all to stay silent. Reducing the fun even more. Some one here said that you can even clip it somewhere? No clips found. Nevertheless you can still get giggles (1st star) plus it includes batteries to play out of the box (2nd star).  
 You would think that a film with a top-notch cast, sumptuous visuals, and thrilling action would be a joy to behold.  You would think.  No pun intended, where did this film go off-track? For starters if you're going to make a heist picture you should at least make the participants likable.  We're really in Sean Connery's camp after he murders one of his henchmen.  The only apparent reason that Connery is given a hero's cheer at the film's conclusion is because the script dictates it to.  The heist is thrilling, but so what if the perpetrators leave you cold 
 While he gets high marks for imagination about this planet with a thinking landmass/bioshpere, his storyline and his characters just don't cut it. This is despite the fact that the protagonist later appears in significant roles in Eon and Eternity. His experince here is supposed to affect his outlook in the other two books. Granted I read them in the wrong order as this prequel came much later, but it doesn't work for me on any level 
 To much guitar, drowns out all the other instruments.  Survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums, not guitars.  I was expecting another Burning Heart, Is this Love, High on you.  No songs on this albums have that sound.  The vocals by Jamison are top notch, but none of the songs sound like the Survivor I remember.  Survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards, bass and drums, not drive the whole song. I guess Jim Peterik was the man behind Survivor all along.  I give the CD 2 stars for Fire makes Steel, the rest are throw aways.  ***Recommended for die hards only*** I highly recommend 'When Seconds Count' for anyone getting started with Survivor 
 No earth shattering or interesting receipes here.  You can find most of the party ideas online 
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
    I found this book to be very good. The reason I thought this was because it has a great story line of mystery, adventure, and action. It also has a great them to it. The theme came out to me as that you can't hang over something for a long time because if you do it will only drive you insane, adn make you mad at yourself and the world.       I thought that this book was good and all, but I could'nt really focus on it after about 20 pages. So I read around a chapter or two every other night or so.The easiest aprt for me to read was toward the end of the book because thats when it got really exciting and the mystery startd to unfold.       I think that this book is excellent for anyone who enjoys mystery stories. This book is also i think good for teenagers because this story is fiction, but a situation like this book could very well happen to any teenagers life. 
 Apparently, the remote control I got was defective - and the only solution was to send it back.  I chose to get a refund rather than a replacement because I was so disappointed 
 This book is for people who do not have a wedding budget and who can afford a $100,000.00 wedding.  This book is so dry and boring talking about etiquete it puts you to sleep.  It makes planning a wedding seem like  planning a funeral.  No fun at all 
 Wack cd. Low quality producer/s and talent.  except for about 2 or 3 artists (rakim & ken-y being the only reason i gave it 2 instead of 1 stars) this whole compilation is a complete waste of your time and money.  If you value your hard earned money then may i suggest "Los Kambumbos". it is a compilation of high quality produced by dj Jova and it includes a pantheon of quality artists including; trebol clan, khriz & angel, Nicky Jam, Tito el bambino and more. 
 This is a very well-written book, but it is OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD. The selection of topics was excellent for the time, but it is now a different time. If you are not yet brain-dead, i.e. not content with teaching only what you learned as a grad student, try something more current, such as Chaikin and Lubensky 
 I came to this book wanting to believe, and leaning towards belief, but with plenty of skepticism. This book reinforced my skepticism. It is not intended as a defense of the visions, per se, but friendly non-skeptical interviews with the visionairies, and report of Marian messages to the Parish at Medjugorge, and a smattering of anecdotes of seemingly miraculous events. The interviews with the visionairies were most unsatisfying. The questions were leading and shallow, nothing like the kind of questions I wish I could ask. Even worse, the answers were stereotyped, vague, and even evasive. Was this a language barrier problem? An artifact of the interviews being condensed and edited? An effort to avoid arguments? Perhaps. But I kept comparing in my mind these transcripts with scriptural accounts of conversations with Jesus. Jesus, despite all language barriers and editing, was always very direct, clear, and substantive, and never shied away from stirring up controversy. Jesus also taught us to be on guard against the many false prophets who would surely come. I remain on guard 
 I was not impressed by Mr. Robinson's analysis.  His shock at the level of criminality that exists in any community is shocking to me.  Is he pretending to be naive, or, is he truly naive?  Why does he pretend NOT to know what was happening in his community.  I don't care if he was raised in Richmond or any other small town.  I think that he pretends to be naive when he really isn't. I don't like that level of pretentiousness.  He also did not do his homework.  Kittrell College, where Peewee went to school is not in Henderson but in Kittrell, NC which is very close to Henderson.  I also did not like his rambling on about his kids going to a school in the future.  Finally, I was very impressed at The Debt, at least he kept to the point of the book.  I thought that I would read more of his books because of his very fine articulation of what he sees as the problem and why African American should get reparations, but this book was not very good at all.  Try again--Randall 
 I usually like Tami Hoag's books, she is a story teller with a surprising twist. The twist was there this time also. However,the characters were way too predictable. They all seemed on the dark side, even the "heroes." Surely there has got to be a non-divorced person in this world. Not in her book. Well, unless you are the guy who kills people because they're in the way. Then you can be single and never married.  The bad guys had no redemptive features -- too cartoon-like.   And the unnecessarily bad language was a turn-off. Surely even in cop land not every one uses the f... word in every sentence.  The plot was somewhat interesting but felt undeveloped, kind of like the characters.  Of course tastes differ. I like a bit more psychological depth with my murders than Tami Hoag offers in this story. Maybe next time 
 Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.    The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.         
 I'm what I would call an advanced C# developer, but have always felt I could use some education in accepted design patterns.  I thought this book would be a great start.  Boy was I wrong!  I second every complaint I've read in these user reviews.  That said, I'd like to add one more to the list:  Often there was nothing in the text to explain how exactly the example code exemplified the pattern being discussed!  This was maddening to me--you get some bad code, then an unnecessary line-by-line description of how the bad code works, but you're no closer to understanding the proper application of the design pattern 
 We got this as a gift and  have used it 0 times.  It's expensive and poorly designed.  A large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper, easier to fold, and nicer looking 
 This book started off good, and I really liked the way it was written - focusing on a bunch of different characters one by one and seeing what they were up to at that moment in conjunction with the plot.  So that was cool.  As the book went on, though, I began to get a little annoyed.  Am I supposed to believe that after one great day, two strangers can think of nothing but each other and are going to such great lengths because they've both fallen in love with each other?  I wish they'd either been together a little more at the beginning or at the end, as I didn't really feel any chemistry between them.  It was an OK book overall - although the ending seemed rushed and I wish I could have known what happened after that, it wasn't very satisfying for me - but I'm rather disappointed that I bought this book at full price and am now stuck with it, since I'll probably never reread it.  I'd recommend this to you only if you buy it at a used bookstore or check it out from the library and aren't expecting the best book in the world.  Maybe if I'd set my expectations lower, I would have enjoying it more.  :- 
 Mackinnon's more theoretical discussions are based on Marxism and Freudianism.  She doesn't really bother to offer any sort of "Epistemology of Method" or "Prolegamena," so the many philosophical issues that surround her approach are simply left hanging.  This raises serious concerns in light of very critical, devastating attacks on both Marx and Freud over the last 10 years or so.  Marx's economic and metaphysical theories, while all the rage among certain quarters in the Humanities, are embarassingly simple-minded and reductivist as anyone can determine who has actually spent a good time reading him.  Freud, thanks to Patricia Churchland's excellent book, has finally been shown to be the pseudo-scientist quack most reasonable people always knew him to be.  As such, MacKinnon's book is based on two thinkers whose theories have been completely discredited and dismissed.  What does this say, then, for her work?  If you want a serious, philosophically substantial work on modern political theory, read Habermas, Rawls, Nozick, Onora O'Neill, etc - 
 "Le Morte d'Arthur" or "The Death of Arthur" is an exceptionaly long and boring book no one should ever have to read 
 i loved the ideas presented in this book, and i do read alot of books about the media, modern technologies, and their effect on our lives and on the society.  although the presented ideas are great, the style of the writing gets to me every time.  absolutely terrible.  im not sure if the author was trying to exemplify the mass confusions, lack of attention span of today's society through the litteral writing, but it detracts from the points that he makes.  many examples are presented have no form of organization whatsoever, and many arent even necessary.  zengotita could have conveyed the message of the book in half the length and it would have been more effective than this book will ever be 
 I tought it would be a good deal, since the price is really low, but not TOO low, but it doesn`t really works... It only has 6 or so stations to choose from, and in all of them the interference is louder than the music. I wouldn`t recomend this product at all... if at least it worked as a car charger... 
 First off, I purchased the book and was really excited after finishing it. I began to research where to buy "Country Mallow", a specific type of ephedra, that the doctor recommends. After countless unsuccessful hours of searching for the product by itself and not part of a mixture,I decided to e-mail the doctor and ask where I could purchase it. After all, he did say that he perscribes it to his patients. I found it very disturbing that he not only does'nt have a e-mail address, but further research led me to his medical profile...He is just a internal medicine doctor, not a specialist. Yes, he does have a phone number and address to contact him, however, after working directly with doctors and their staff for eleven years, you most likely would need to make an appointment to speak with the man. I'd bet my last dollar that he would'nt "consult" with you over the phone.I work as a phlebotomist and most doctors will NOT give any info over the phone without seeing you as a NEW patient first. So, in my opinion, and thats all it is, I wouldnt jump to follow an Internal Medicine doctor but one that does have a degree in Holistic Medicine, or one that has a Bariatric degree. I cant stress the importance of blood work first to find out if its something else and not just a slow metabolisim. I have an appointment with my doctor this Wednesday to have a thyroid screen as well as a hypo-adrenalism screen 
   God, this movie was....lame. I mean, it was lame. It limped; it struggled, it staggered.   I lost track of the cliches during the first five minutes.  The really graphic sex scene that indicated the girl was gonna get killed? Check. The sleazeball guy getting killed? Check. The sleazeball guy practically begging for death? "Here, doggie..."?  That's eighty minutes of my life I'll never get back.  
 Richard Haass attempts to distinguish himself from the neocons. Aside from form, however, the substance really isn't any different. Both begin with the assumption that American Imperium is a requirement for peace and prosperity and any real deviation means *global* catastrophe. Any suggestion that American Imperium itself is the problem is simply beyond the pale, and is dismissed by all sides of american foreign policy elite (neocons and neorealists) as "unserious" or worse. Neocons and neorealists are 2 sides of the same coin. The "argument" between them is kabuki theater. A pointless handwringing melodrama, signifying little and meaning even less. At their core, both are motivated by a proconsul's view of the world where the only future of humanity worth living is one where america's elite, and the children of america's elite, are the one's calling the shots.   It's not a view shared by the rest of the world 
 It is CONSERVATISM that is a mental disorder! In fact, that's a perfect description! Conservatives think that marriage has a magical "sanctity" and that allowing homosexuals to enjoy the feat of marriage will somehow cause the earth to implode or something. They also believe that everything should be ruled by word of the bible as a mirror of the Middle Ages, just like the Taliban. Liberals try simply to reverse this epidemic, but they are simply outnumbered. 
 Boring book, bad writing, inaccurate histroy.  Too much opinion, little facts 
 I have loved this series from the beginning - great characters, fun stories, thrills and romance.  Very light, quick reads that are great entertainment.  This story was awful.  There were two mysteries.  One was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding, and the other was so convoluted I didn't even get it.    A comment was made that one person, when convicted, wouldn't be around to hurt anyone any more. But this person wasn't even the perp for the big mystery.  And the epilogue? WHO was that person?  And how did they figure it out?  Too many holes for an otherwise easy read.    Finally, the characterization was off.  The normal comraderie between the girls was missing.  I felt no love from the original three for Yuki, in spite of her storyline.  If there's a sixth story, I hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books.  I'm giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends.  If I had just picked up the series with this book, it would be a one.  Sorry James 
 I read this book -- and was somewhat impressed -- when I was a kid, but rereading it today it seems like a book written mostly to impress adolescents of the 1970s. The female characters are poorly drawn, the hip lingo is *really* out-dated, and the conundrum faced by the protagonist fails to grab today's adult readers. Even the profanity is boring 
 Darwin's most celebrated nemesis was Samuel Wilberforce, the Archbishop of Canterbury, head of the Anglican Church, who was ridiculed by the young biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, in a now famous debate on evolution held in England back in 1860. It's clearly a bit of an exaggeration to describe former University of California, Berkeley law professor Phillip Johnson as "Darwin's Nemesis", since he has come across more as a lightweight intellectual Luddite in his criticisms of evolutionary biology. I will concede that Phillip Johnson may be a gifted legal scholar and a fine law school teacher (One of his former students may have been a former classmate of mine in Frank McCourt's celebrated Stuyvesant High School creative writing course, who earned some notoriety nearly a decade ago for being one of the two female attorneys responsible for deposing Monica Lewinsky at Special White House Counsel Kenneth Starr's Whitewater Washington, D. C.-based grand jury.). But frankly, that's all the credit I am willing to concede to Professor Johnson, since he has demonstrated repeatedly his gross ignorance of science and understanding how excellent scientific research is done (For example, please see my Amazon.com customer review of his book "Darwin on Trial" which I wrote a few years ago.). Such ignorance has been displayed repeatedly by Johnson in his spirited advocacy of "Intelligent Design", via his "Wedge Strategy", in which he and his colleagues have sought to portray "Intelligent Design" as a viable, credible alternative to the Modern Synthesis Theory of Evolution (Of which its fundamental core was - and still remains - Darwin's Theory of Evolution via Natural Selection; one of the "fathers" of the Modern Synthesis, distinguished Russian-American geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky once said that "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.". That profound declaration by Dobzhansky still holds true today.). However, "Intelligent Design" is merely the latest manifestation of an old idea stated originally by William Paley back in the 17th Century, which was rejected soundly not by Darwin and his circle of friends, but instead, by "creationist" precursors who were both eminent scientists and clergymen in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. More succinctly, and indeed, more to the point, this apparently "novel" idea was rejected once by scientists hundreds of years ago; but Phillip Johnson, Michael Behe, and William Dembski valiantly wish that it receive ample consideration from the scientific community, even after Judge John Jones' landmark decision in the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Board of Education trial, in which he concluded that Intelligent Design was a religious doctrine masquerading as science (It is posted at:  htttp://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-12-20_kitzmiller_decision.pdf.).  I find the notion of a Festschrift published in honor of Professor Johnson as absurd as a group of Neo-Nazis publishing one to commemorate Adolf Hitler and his hate-filled book "Mein Kampf" (I find this an apt comparison since Johnson and quite a few of his supporters have an ideological world view that is remarkably close to the likes of Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden.). If these 19 papers in "Darwin's Nemesis: Phillip Johnson And the Intelligent Design Movement" demonstrate anything, they note only his importance as the movement's spiritual godfather. However, more importantly, these papers demonstrate collectively the lack of good judgement, sloppy logic, and, quite frankly, intellectual dishonesty of "Intelligent Design" supporters. There are other,  much better, and intellectually honest, books on this issue, such as Robert Pennock's "Tower of Babel" (It has the best historical overview and philosophical rebuttal to "Intelligent Design" that I've read so far.), Kenneth Miller's "Finding Darwin's God (My friend Ken has a brilliant rebuke of the Intelligent Design argument of irreducible complexity.), and Eugenie Scott's "Evolution vs. Creationism" (Her book may be the best introductory textbook on this issue available now.). Don't waste your time thinking of acquiring this book, which is a vapid tribute to Intelligent Design's spiritual godfather; it should have been entitled "When Fools Rush In".  (EDITORIAL NOTE: I was tempted to ignore ad hominenm attacks masquerading as comments listed below, but will note that these remarks are exactly what you'd expect from Intellectual Luddites. 
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
 Worked good for a few months.. then battery started draining fast.  Now after just 1 or 2 calls the battery is dead.  
 In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process "domestication" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.  While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.  According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).  The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, "domesticated" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.    One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God."  He uses it to epitomize the use of "word" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather "Jesus Christ".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that "sin begins with rejection of yourself" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7).  It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.  In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz "you are dealing with yourself, not me" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally.   According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was "trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.  Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.  In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.    While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations. 
 I had to get this book for a graduate class I am taking and overall I felt it didn't offer anything new in the world of writing.   It's basically a news writing book but few differences are mentioned in regards to writing for Web pages. There isn't anything in it about how to program the site or lay it out, it's all style.  It isn't much help when you've already read numerous news writing books and taken news writing classes, but for a beginner it might work well. 
 I was drawn to this book by the promise of experiencing or gaining familiarity with a new part of Paris, a city I have visited often.  The book fell far short of that.  It left me disappointed and longing for what I had missed.  It was difficult to connect with or enter into the story primarily  because the author failed to portray a personal intimacy with the subject. As an example, she tells us that moving within Paris was a bigger event than imagined but the description lacked emotional depth. Where were her feelings, little experiences, failings, successes, reactions. Overall, the author proved she has knowledge but does not know how to share it.   
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 I am a Trevanian maniac. I buy every used copy of Shibumi I can find, just in case the world ends and I am left to wander the rubble with no chance of a new edition of Shibumi. get it? I love Trevanian. This new book? More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every  genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile. But I found this new book to be boring, trite, petty, and poorly written, and it gets one star because, as a Trevanian diehard, I have no choice 
 As an 8th gr teacher we don't want to spend hours teching grammar the old way boring the students.  This book is wonderful because they are interested in the stories. This interest also allows them to truly understand the concept of grammar and punctuation 
 If ever I have bought a worthless piece of #### this is it.  This man has absolutely nothing useful, except to warn you time and again not to be a day trader.  He repeats the same very basic concepts in all the beginning chapters.  I learned nothing useful except a ton of webpages and daytrading courses offered by the daytraders who he interviewed complete with thier  800 numbers....A real waste of ... I kid you not 
 This performer deserves all the latitude necessary, as she may yet develop into a relevant, insightful, and original interpreter of the music she offers. I truly hope she does not choose to compete with Eliot Fisk in the Indy-500 or the 24-Hours of Le Mans. Based on the samples, I won't be buying this CD as I can program my computer to play just as fast or even faster, and just as clear. Instead, I recommend the Frank Bungarten recording (also available on Amazon). But Ana Vidovic does show a lot of promise, and deserves encouragement 
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 I was hoping to find new insight to me depression and PMDD, but only found the same old same old.  The book's pollyanna tone while talking about such a serious subject was annoying.  For people not already under care of a physician or who think they are alone, this book could be very helpful, but if you already know something about the role that hormones play in women's mental health you won't find anything new here 
 I received this unit as a gift.  Rechargeable batteries work well for my portable electronics and I thought this 15-minute charger would be a huge improvement over the overnight charger I own.  It wasn't.  Like others leaving comments here, I found that this charger rejects many batteries I put in it with its annoying flashing red light -- including brand new NiMh batteries.  All of my batteries rejected by this charger worked just find in my overnight charger.    I threw this charger in the trash where it belongs 
 I have been greatly been disappointed in this book. I am a total Francophile and soak up just about any book on life in southern France, be it travelogue, novel, cultural study, etc. I have been reading Map of Another Town over the past few months and it's been a struggle. MFK Fisher goes into painfully boring and unnecessary detail on the most insignificant things, like having to go back and forth between offices and buildings while seeking the appropriate vaccinations for a trip to Africa, and what she thinks of every little thing related to the process. She'll devote pages and pages to experiences that have nothing to do with live in Aix-en-Provence and its environs -- it's a map of her own head, where she spends too much time. She finds herself rather fascinating, but I found her self-centered.   I thought it would be interesting to read about life there in the 1950s and 1960s, but again, the book is less a cultural study than autobiographical ramblings (if you can find it, Village in the Vaucluse, a Laurence Wylie cultural study first written in 1957 and updated in 1967 and 1974, is fascinating and was one of my college texts for a French culture course -- 5 stars plus.). I probably will not even bother with A Considerable Town and will finish Map of Another Town only because I feel like I should.  If you are considering this book because life in southern France fascinates you, I would instead recommend any of the Peter Mayle books (not jumping on the bandwagon here; I've read his books from the beginning and own all of them, and his writing style is absolutely delightful and endearing, even when he's being a snob), Yvone Lenard, etc. In fact, Peter Mayle's books so charmingly describe Provence that they serve as a guidebook to the best the region has to offer, so you can visualize and plan your own trip. With his writing style, it feels like you're along for the trip, whereas with MFK Fisher, you wonder when you're going to get there. 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 This razor is not worth the money. It did shave pretty well for a few months, but the rubber strips wear out really quickly. And, even though the "cleaning option" with the fluid seems like a great idea... it does not work very well... the razor was never clean... and refilling the fluid is just a pain... I would not recommend this razor 
 Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that "Three Junes" was listed as a popular book choice.  The title sounded interesting so I bought it.  That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.  It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.  I will finish the book because that's my style.  It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to. 
 Read Andrea Makris' law suit at www.thesmokinggun.com all the dirty details are there, and should be required reading for anyone who reads O'Reilly or takes him seriously. He SETTLED the case after smearing her and threatening her, he's a little wimp and a coward and a "loofa" loving creep. Keep him away from your children! I Know the guy. from Washington  Jeff Gannon 
 As to the best of my knowledge, there were two major intellectual responses to the seemingly endless and insuperable crisis which the capitalist system had got itself into after the Great Slump of 1929: Keynes`s "General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment" of 1936 and Schumpeter`s "Capitalism" which was first published in 1942. Like Marx before them, both Keynes and Schumpeter reject the "classic economists'" contention that what they called the market system wll always automatically swing back to an ideal equilibrium - expecially one that implied full employment - provided only the state kept its hands off as much as possible.   However, that is just about where their concurrence ends. While Marx sees the only solution outside the system, in its bloody overthrow and its succession by a "dictatorship of the proletariat" introducing the next evolutionary step in human history, called socialism, Keynes considered the market system as basically viable. All that was needed, according to him, was governmental involvement by which the lacking demand in times of a slump would be lifted to more agreeable levels. Schumpeter, in contrast, agrees with Marx in that capitalism's days are counted and that it is about to be replaced by socialism, even though he doesn't share Marx`s more aggressive notions: according to him, the present day capitalists need not be dealt with by the guillotine alone, they may indeed have a useful function as entrepreneurs employed by his envisaged omnipotent and omniscient super agency that will ideally plan everybody's well-being in his imagined socialist system.  What to think of the book today? First, it is hard to fathom how Schumpeter could have turned such an absolutely blind eye on the totalitarian tendencies necessarily inherent in a state that not only controlled the political field but also was quasi the monopolist employer and as such responsible for the economic side of peoples's lives as well, in particular when one considers the time when it came out: 1942! Second, it is a fine example of how wrong you can get things even if (or: because?) you know so much as Schumpeter did - maybe that is the best argument of all against the establishment of such a super agency planning everybody's life to the extent envisaged by Schumpeter. Finally, even if such an agency did not err - is it not a basic right - and half of the fun of life - to make mistakes - for oneself that is, not forcing them on others 
 I read another book by this author, Friendship Cake, which I really enjoyed and passed around to several friends. So I picked this one up thinking it would be worth a read. Luckily, it only took me about an hour and a half to read it, since that's about as long as I'll remember it.  I guess I never really cared about the characters too much. It's not a thick enough book that there's a lot of room for exploring and exposing the characters, which is too bad, because they could be interesting. And I know Hinton's capable of it from her last book. I also read that the author thinks race relations is so important to this story ... I never got the whole emphasis on race relations thing. The story happens to characters who happen to be interracial friends/lovers, but I never get that it's important to the plot.  Not to mention that the "big secret" is telegraphed so blatantly it's hard not to know what it is almost immediately.   In spite of its faults, I think it would be OK for a quick beach read or if you just don't care for much depth at the moment 
 Stupid story line, silly characters and so predictable...what did I miss that all of the other reviewers found so earth-shattering????  It was slightly entertaining but basically a waste of time.  When it finally came to an end I had no emotional response except that I was glad I was finished.  I don't know what else to say except don't bother with it.  There are LOTS of great books out there and this isn't one of them.  I kept reading it because of all the wonderful reviews, and thought it MUST get better once I got into it...NOT!!!  I guess I really missed something here, but for the life of me I can't imagine what it was!!??  I am a fanatic reader of ALL types of writing styles but this one just soared right past me.  Don't bother with it 
 I cannot understand how anyone could understand this book, let alone claim to love it. It has the unfortunate distinction of being the first book I ever hated so much to give up on it, and before I was even halfway through it too! Allegedly there's a plot in there somewhere, but because it is buried underneath constantly shifting narrative, dialogue so unclear you can't tell who's saying what to whom, the unclear point of view, the shattered grammar and tense and made-up vocabulary, the book is so screwy that I literally had NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON. It was like reading a transcription of someone's fever delirium. If I could give this book ZERO STARS, I would! This book is not a classic, it's a gross mistake 
 At $15.95, this is an outrageous rip-off!  The impressive-looking cover image looks like a book, but it only an envelope which contains five LEAFLETS!  They look like the attraction-folders one sees around to be picked up for free.  While the maps are clear, the points of interest listed are described in a few words or short sentences.  You'll get abundantly more information with a book of guided walks.  Don't get suckered in to this excessive price 
 I loved Dr. Pert's previous book, The Molecules of Emotion.  I was thrilled to hear this new book was being released and couldn't wait to get a copy.  The title of this book made bold promises, but I was disappointed to find that it failed miserably to deliver.  I expected a book that would outline activities or exercises to practice the art and science of feeling good and finding one's self in the presence of God in a present-moment way.   The book offered neither, but rather, rambled on and on, outlining Ms. Pert's own life's journey in an in-your-face sales-pitch "I got it, you should too" presentation that only flaunted, and failed to ever really teach.    Ms. Pert's discussions on dietary health and wholeness were limited and contradictory at best.  If you want real data backed by science in this area, I suggest the writings of Dr. John McDougall (especially the McDougall Plan and The McDougall Program), John Robbins, and particularly T. Colin Campbell's China Study.  Little concrete information was really offered in the practice of "feeling good."  If you want practical information and a firm plan that promises results in this area, Dr. Laurel Mellin's The Pathway does more than deliver on such promises.  Recovery from trauma was mentioned, but never really addressed in a practical manner.  Dr. Peter A. Levine's Waking the Tiger and Healing Trauma give deep insights and practical attacks for freedom.    God was promised in the title, but barely even mentioned in the text of the book, most notably almost as an afterthought in the epilogue.  Practitioners of energy healing arts were given far more press than was God.  If it's God you're seeking, the works of Dan Allender (The Cry of the Soul, To Be Told), John Eldredge (The Sacred Romance, The Journey of Desire, Waking the Dead), Brennan Manning (The Ragamuffin Gospel) and the Scriptures will serve you far, far better in the desire for God.  The photograph on the back cover of this book does not appear to be that of someone who is has mastered health and happiness and is living in the presence of God, but rather, that of someone struggling in all of these areas.  I wish Dr. Pert well and no harm, but I have to say I'm completely disappointed in this book 
  This sound tract remix was a boring redundent waste of my time. I should of read other reviews before I purchased it. It's a total waste of $$$ 
 I bought this book thinking it was a beautiful book of fairy paintings.I was judging it strictly from the cover painting which is etheral and beautiful.Unfortunately every other portrait is a soft-core porn fairy.These images aren't even painted well.They simply appeal to low brow male fantasies.Buy a print of Beloved and skip the book 
 We received our sheet set and they felt like Sateen, but when we washed them they lost the Sateen feel.  They feel like flannel.  We are very disappointed with our purchase 
 This book is a sure snooze-fest. Luckily for me I did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class. We read selected chapters of the book. They writing was horrible. Many parts were unclear. I had to reread what I read over and over. I can't stand this style of writing. Barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent. Instead, he comes off as boring and pretentious. Skip this book... try something else 
     Fullbrook(F)has edited a collection of essays written by a group of heterodox economists belonging to the American Post Keynesian,Institutionalist,and Cambridge Keynesian schools of thought.Underlying most of the essays is the explicit or implicit belief that the use of formal mathematical and statistical tools by mainstream(neoclassical)economists has been counterproductive because the models used by such economists are not relevant to the real world.I will concentrate my review on Part V of the book,titled"Misuse of Mathematics and Statistics".First,there are a number of problems with the way in which particular mathematical and statistical techniques are used and applied(misused and misapplied)by mainstream(neoclassical)economists.Both J M Keynes and Benoit Mandelbrot pointed out that mathematical modeling in economics must allow for interdependencies,multiple equilibria,and feedback effects,while statistical applications to economics(econometrics)must first concentrate on the analysis of the data.An example would be to use a chi-square or Lexis-Q test for goodness of fit instead of just  assuming  that the normal(lognormal,binomial,etc.) distribution can be applied.Unfortunately,the essays by S.Keen and D.Gillies on mathematical economics and the essay by S.Ziliak on economic statistics and econometrics contain many unsupported claims,as well as errors of omission, that have little,if anything,to do with the attempts made by  Keynes and Mandelbrot to convince economists to be much more careful and selective in their initial use of particular techniques .Ziliak(and his frequent coauthor, D.N. McCloskey)fails to realize that the problem facing econometricians is much,much more severe than just the apparent failure of most econometricians to  successfully differentiate between the concepts of statistical significance and economic significance.The problem is that econometric practice is founded on the a priori belief that practically all analysis of economic data can be based on the assumption of normality.In fact,the reverse is the case.In general,the normal probability distribution does not come close to being a correct statistical approximation of most economic data.This was the major point made by Keynes in his 1939-40 exchange with Tinbergen on the logical foundations of econometrics.It has been one of the major points made by Mandelbrot since the mid 1950's.Nowhere in Ziliak's essay will the reader get these points because neither Keynes nor Mandelbrot are mentioned anywhere.Gillies' article is marred by his failure to point out that the mathematics of field theory,electron spin theory,string theory and super string theory in mathematical physics ,like much of neoclassical economics,has little or no empirical and/or experimental support now or even in the distant future.Gillies' claim that Keynes's footnote on p.280 of the General Theory meant that the mathematical analysis in chapter 20 could be ignored  reveals Gillies' mathematical innumeracy and ineptness,since this chapter provides the mathematical proof of Keynes's claim that stable unemployment equilibriums, with associated involuntary unemployment levels,could occur due to the multiple equilibrium nature of capitalist economies.Of course,Keynes had explicitly provided his readers in chapter 19,pp.261-262,with the major result of his theory,that only in the case of a marginal propensity to spend with a value of 1(or if the mpc+mpi=1=mpc+mps,where the mpc is the marginal propensity to consume,mpi is the marginal propensity to invest,and mps is the marginal propensity to save)will a full employment equilibrium occur.Chapters 20 and 21 provide the interested reader with the formal mathematical derivation of the result stated by Keynes in chapter 19.Keynes successfully generalized neoclassical theory in chapters 20 and 21.Hence the footnote at the bottom of p.280.A reader who is not interested in the manner in which Keynes derived his result can skip this part of the chapter.In conclusion,Gillies' claim that the General Theory is a qualitative theory without any mathematical foundation is simply false(Gillies,p.197).Keynes's general theory is specified by the condition that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p = the real wage.Keen's article claims that the theory of the perfectly competitive firm is based on a mathematical error.This claim is simply false.The theory is based on the subjective assumption by the owner of such a firm that it is impossible for him to raise or lower his price.Given this assumption,the firm's demand curve will appear as a horizontal line,which is the only way you can economically model such a firm.The conclusion is that he will receive the same price for different amounts of his output.Only after the basic economic assumptions have been specified will a mathematical representation consistent with the economic assumptions be supplied.The best exposition is in the third edition of C E Ferguson,1972,Microeconomic Theory,pp.123-124,251-253.Section 8.4,pp.255-270.Keen is correct that the 1957 article by Stigler in the Journal of Political Economy contains a mathematical error.Ferguson was well aware of this article(see Ferguson,1972,p.317).He correctly ignores Stigler's attempt to provide a purely mathematical foundation for the perfectly competitive firm without first specifying the economic assumptions that must go first.What is wrong with economics is the failure of the economics profession to grasp the mathematical proof that Keynes constructed in the GeneralTheory in chapters 20 and 21 or comprehend the optimality condition spelt out by Keynes on pp.261-262 of the General Theory. None of the authors in this book have the slightest clue about what Keynes did.It is better to go and buy a copy of the General Theory than purchase this book in its current form 
 This book was completely unfulfilling. It's hard to imagine a book that could be less useful for investors. Perhaps Costakos assumes that his potential customers are simpletons who don't know how the Internet works. Even so, his consistent proselytizing for his own online brokerage will annoy both neophytes and experienced traders alike 
 I Love the Mag, but sister never recieved the order I gave her as a gift!!! 
 This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story 
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 This isn't so much of a game guide as it is a character list, and even that is incomplete (missing a character). The information in this section is copied directly from the character illustration section of the game, and contains nothing that would be helpful in game.  There is no information about the default statistics for any of the characters (health, ki, attack, defense, etc.), only a list of their 5 special moves, and that information is available in game as well.  There is no information on the advantages, disadvantages, or unique abilities of any of the characters, many of which you would never be aware of unless you discover them by trial and error, accident, or through other sources of info on the game. Some characters, for example, have the ability to absorb health or ki from opponents or absorb the energy from opponents ki attacks, or to regenerate lost health. This obviously useful information is not even hinted at in this guide.  The guide contains no information on the Z-evolution character customization feature, such as the specific effects of increasing various character attributes or of special items.  Although the guide contains a list of fusions for unlocking many of the characters, it contains absolutely no information about those characters which can only be unlocked by collecting the dragonballs (Roshi, Kid Goku, Tao Pai Pai, Great Ape, and Vegeta Great Ape), or even how the dragonballs are found in the game. This is a serious oversight.  An even more serious oversight is an error in the basic controls. The actions for the R1 and R2 buttons and for the L1 and L2 buttons are listed incorrectly. This is unforgivable in a game guide. How can they not get the basic controls right? All of the information on the basic controls is covered in greater detail in the manual that comes with the game and in in-game tutorials.   The walk-throughs for each of the fights in the story mode only state the obvious, and were not at all helpful.  This game guide offers almost no value whatsoever, and I consider it a total waste of money. Unfortunately, this seems to be par for the course for Prima. Other Prima game guides I have purchased have been similarly lacking.  Perhaps Brady Games will develop the strategy guide for the next Dragonball Z game and we'll actually get a guide worth buying 
 Despite all the bad reviews I read for various Monster Cable products, I bought one of these cables.  What a mistake.  The RCA plug flanges kept working loose shortly after purchase.  The first time I tried to gently squeeze them back together, one broke, only to reveal the cheap metal used in the connector.  Now it's loose all the time.  So I'm replacing it with a Belkin AV20500-15 cable, available right here at Amazon for about 1/4 the price of Monster.  Thankfully I chose other brands for all my other home theater cables (digital coax, optical, speaker) .  Avoid all Monster Cables.  All overpriced, all mediocre quality.  Do your research, you'll see I'm not alone.  
 Don't get me wrong, I think Sublime is a great band and every song on this CD is awesome.  But considering that the band only put out 3 albums (not counting the live, acoustic, or rarities albums) wouldn't it make more sense to purchase those 3 albums (40oz, Robbin, self titled) instead of buying this double disc set? 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 I agree with the earlier reviewer, as far as mean people and animal cruelty go.  I could hardly finish the book myself, not only because of the animal cruelty and abuse but also the author's total indifference to it.  I don't particularly care to read about people abusing and killing animals (killing a mother cow because she wants to keep her calf, and shooting 13 puppies because "they are ugly"), and basically that is what a lot of this book is about.  Not a very good or interesting read, author is whiney and self-absorbed - don't waste your time with this garbage 
 In this book Noble Cunningham has managed to make one of the most fascinating figures in American history pedestrian. He provides a dutiful recounting of the facts of Jefferson's life, but never makes him come alive. His thesis--that Jefferson saw the use of reason as the highest human undertaking--is certainly valid, but Jefferson was a man of enormous contradictions, none of which are truly explored here. This book makes the man who said "Democracy ought to be periodically washed in blood" seem like a hardworking civil servant 
 Goldman's ranting and raving will soon get onto your nerves, especially  since he frequently shows himself to be a hypocrite. In several places he  speaks of his dislike for special effect-filled blockbusters, then in other  places he says how he loved movies like "Independence Day". It  also seems odd how Goldman hasn't written a solid screenplay for some time  now, and has written a number of scripts for those blockbuster movies, yet  he whines about the "junk" screenplays Hollywood uses. (By the  way, he's writing the screenplay for "Jurassic Park 3" - even  though he voices slams against Spielberg here!) Everything to him seems to  be Hollywood's fault, though he never mentions how even before "Star  Wars", audiences were starting to stay away from movies like  "McCabe And Mrs. Miller". He certainly never mentions how many  independent films come out each year that critics love, but the audience  doesn't go to. In short, the audience decides what movies get made. If  Goldman is reading this, I dare him to answer these charges. But he  probably won't - his next book will probably be more whines yet again about  how the final votes in the Academy Awards should be revealed, how movies  are "worse than ever", yadayadayada. Goldman, put up or shut up -  not only for these charges, but the screenplays you write 
 I'll second Bargain Savvy Mom's review. I don't want a brush to vacuum large, flat, smooth surfaces. I can use a cloth to wipe dust off those kinds of surfaces. I want a brush to dust rough or textured surfaces, such as fabrics, speaker grills, textured walls, that sort of thing. This simply doesn't work for any of those. If you look closely at the picture you'll notice that the bristles on this brush flare out at a pretty wide angle. What you can't see is that the bristles are very stiff. As a result, if you are trying to dust anything other than a hard smooth surface the leading bristles constantly grab the surface you're dusting and you feel like you're fighting with it all the time. Softer bristles pointed more straight down would have been a lot better. I tried this on a few things but just found it to be useless for what I wanted to do with it. Your mileage may vary.  Oh, and $30 seems way overpriced for this light weight thing made from cheap plastic 
 Kelly advertizes himself as a "student" of Frank Frazetta, but he hasn't learned anything except how to imitate the master.  Stiff, uninvolving, poorly designed, lifeless figures go through boring rehashes of Frazetta motifs.  If a student showed me this work, I'd encourage him to keep going in the hope that he might eventually find his own style.  He once did a Famous Monsters of Filmland cover that wasn't too bad, because he was copying from  photographs.  Boris is another one that has built a career scavenging from Frazetta, but at least he has slick craftmanship.  Kelly is an incompetent draughtsman and his compositions are awkward.  Did his family connections get him this book?  Sorry to sound harsh, but this stuff is junior league 
 Very dissapointing. Too many wildlife creature noises. If I had wanted to hear birds singing in the rain and other animal noises I would have looked for a title that matched my request. I wanted to hear rain and thunder only. 
 I have not before read material with such distortion.  Barton ignores the obvious viewpoints of Madison and Jefferson and throws his net wide to quote obscurity.  Then he proceeds to misquote, by adding "he said" or "they said" and then filling in his own words.  His techniques are sorry, but effective, as long as bearing false witness is acceptable. 
 This guy cheered when 9-11 happened. Don't buy anything of his.  Knight Ridder Newspapers Oct. 14, 2004 03:08 PM  If Osama bin Laden ever buys a rap album, he'll probably start with a CD by KRS-One. The hip-hop anarchist has declared his solidarity with al-Qaida by asserting that he and other African-Americans "cheered when 9-11 happened," reports the New York Daily News. The rapper, real name Kris Parker, defiled the memory of those who died in the terrorist attacks as he spouted off at a recent New Yorker Festival panel discussion. advertisement   "I say that proudly," the Boogie Down Productions founder went on, insisting that, before the attack, security guards kept Blacks out of the World Trade Center "because of the way we talk and dress. "So when the planes hit the building, we were like, 'Mmmm - justice.' " The atrocity of 9-11 "doesn't affect us the hip-hop community," he said. "9-11 happened to them, not us," he added, explaining that by "them" he meant "the rich ... those who are oppressing us. RCA or BMG, Universal, the radio stations." Parker also sneered at efforts by other rappers to get young people to vote. "Voting in a corrupt society adds more corruption," he added. "America has to commit suicide if the world is to be a better place. 
  Unless you are an immature tramp I cannot fathom how you could enjoy, relate or even read this nonsense. The style and to a lesser extent the story hold merit on a historical basis, but the plot is dated and obscured to the wanna-feel-empowered nobodies of the world. That people think this is a great book betrays how foolish the reading public are; seriously, just stick to what Oprah tells you to read, or better, simply plop down in front of the television and watch 'reality.'   I am not saying this is not an important book; it is. But if you think it possesses literary Quality, read 'Confessions of Nat Turner,' 'Go Tell It On the Mountain,' 'The Invisible Man,' 'Native Son,' and tell me that this book belongs in the same class of fiction as these novels.  Am I biased? Yes, completely, I think that the work of women does not compare favorably to what men have achieved in letters. I mean, "Atlas Shrugged" is one of the most horrid things mankind has produced! But there is the converse....I mean, how many great wives, how many good stay-at-home moms have been men 
 This book is an insult. Sure, there are some facts about this television series, but the book seems directed at people whose IQ would never permit them to understand what is going on on-screen. The print is large with huge margins and wide spaces between lines of print. Had they printed it in regular format, the 300 pages could have neem accomodated in 200, which seems a blessing when one thinks of wasted trees. The language is on a 6th-grade level. This is bad enough, but why didn't the publishers provide even minimal proof-reading services? The book is chock-full of typos and grammatical errors that would embarrass anyone. There are even sentences that simply stop in the middle and hang there on the page looking like a bloody limb hanging off one of the palm trees on the beach of the survivors' island.  This book is a true embarrassment and shame. The writing is all right - no better - but the quality control is simply non-existent. How can anyone be this uncaring?  There are other Lost books on the market. Any of them would be better than this one 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 So this is what the onetime flagship of the east coast has to offer us. a bunch of remix's with washed up rappers(Craig Mack comes to mind). Hip hop turned pop. BIG gotta be spinnin in his f***in' grave. Knowing he use to roll with this sellout b**ch puffy. Jackin' beats, spittin other ni**as verses, rappin about his wealth. Everything about this ni**a is wrong. He's not even talented, just ridin a dead rapper's street cred. F*** badboy for life 
 Hard to finish - sadly.   I wait with held breath for each new Jayne Ann Krentz book to appear.  And then I found this one.  I still haven't finished it - unfortunately it had put me off reading for awhile.  Quick - someone hand me the new Amanda Quick novel 
 Crudely written. A negative hero deserves better and Wharton has written some fine books. Sadly, not this one. 
 The book that arrived was the correct selection but arrived somewhat damaged with a wrinkled/ folded book cover.  If the packing was stronger, then the book would not have been damaged. 
 Did Murray Sperber ever learn to think critically?  If he tried to talk tough with Bobby Knight using sports jargon he would be laughed out of the room!  Who knows more sports jargon and has all the winning cards, the dumb jock or the arrogant book worm? Sperber argues that scholar/teachers are outdated but a rank/tenure committee can count papers or books or cites where as only the worst and best teachers have a record. Ironically, coaches are one of the few teaching species that have a demonstrable record which is why Knight could get away with anything. Grade schools have discouraged teachers in droves by trying to justify raises using test scores and bias evaluations.  Should research universities turn into popularity contests and experiments in test taking or should the public trust traditional proven methods of retention and promotion 
 I was required to read this book for a college level Appalachain Appreciation class. This book was praised for its story telling abilities and discription of Appalachain culture. While it succeeded in telling a story of a cursed, inbred family, it failed to keep me awake long enough to finish in time for the deadline. The book entertains a host of narrators (maybe entertains isn't the right word) that losely follow a century of the Cantrell family. This book was the fifth book author Lee Smith wrote, following four massive failures. She continued the trend here dragging out a campfire tale for 300 pages. I reluctantly finished the book hopeing for a smashing ending to save myself from feeling like I had waisted my time. Unfortunatly that didn't happen. I don't want to spoil the ending for you, Lee Smith will though. Long story short, save your money 
 So this movie is made of 2 stories.  The first one is quick and involves Takeshi Kaneshiro and Brigitte Lin.  Both have their stories and I actually found Kaneshiro more interesting.  So this thing ends and the movie should have also.  It should have been a 30 minute movie.  So for the next hour or so we get to watch Tony Leung Chiu Wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs.  Wow, what a movie.  The only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day.  She was fun to watch but I still wish I wouldn't have seen this dumb movie.    
 I paid top dollar for PS7 and thought it was time to upgrade to CS2.  After I installed CS2 I discovered that I could not crop any photo without having my PC crash.  Every time it crashed I looked at the defrag utility and I had fragmented files all over the place.  Then I defraged the hard drive and went back to CS2 and tried to crop the same photo again.  Again, my PC hung up and was unresponsive and the defrag utility said I had to defrag.  The only thing I did was to crop one photo in CS2, and that was enough to make it necessary to defrag again.  I uninstalled this piece of garbage from my PC.  It does not work, and I don't care what Deke McClelland says and I don't believe what he says, either. Save your money.  These rip-off artists at Adobe are nothing but thieves.  Yeah, they ripped me off for $153 but you know what?  At least I have my integrity, and that's more than you got, Deke baby.     
 That just about sums it up.  I have to assume that most of the folks who raved about this will say equally enthusiastic things about anything Brian records.  Maybe they pity him, and feel it would be unkind to criticize poor Brian when he's had such a rough time.  Or maybe they've recently discovered that he's one of the geniuses of pop music, and want everyone to know it.  Who knows.  I hate to flame ol' Brian, but I can't in good conscience let other unsuspecting souls waste their money on this; there's so much great music in the world, and life's too short.  (Oh, why does it suck?  It's soulless, commercial, glossy, pointless, and unimaginative.) Oh, and for those of you who find any review critical of Brian's music "unhelpful," this album is wonderful 
 This book did  indeed have too much jargon in it. In parts of the book the writer tap into something good, but not go into enough detail for it to make sense. I read another book like this one that gave me insight into what this book was talking about. It is also outdated. The 203 HUD investment is not available anymore 
 If you don't tend to care about writing, then this would be the magazine for you.  Save your pennies and indulge on something else maybe 
 I really don't care much for Hogarth's style or drawing at all. This book was not worth the money I spent on it 
 i ordered the item saying it was in-stock. but days passed i still havent received the item until i followed it up. i was told the item was in a back order. i think they shouldnt write in-stock if the item is really a back order meaning they dont have it. it delayed the item for 2-3weeks and it was suppose to be a gift. though i can say the item was nice when i got it 
 While it was probably a great deal of work, this author has done little more than regurgitate what is already written in the Cluetrain Manifesto, Customer Relations Management 101, and downloaded from sites on the net.  I found very little that was new or enlightening in this tome.   I was hoping for some new and invigorating concepts in marketing...but it's not here.   
 It's ideas are sound, but it's all stats. This year there was this much and hey look now it's tripled, quadrupled, whatever... Just reading the conclusions of each chapter will give you everything that you need to know. 
 Shaw, who more than any of his contemporaries dealt provocatively with the crucial issues of his day, has not worn well.  In a 1971 encyclopaedia I had as a child, the entry on GBS called him the greatest dramatist since  Shakespeare.  That's better than Moliere, Sheridan, Strindberg, Ibsen,  Wilde, Jarry, Chekhov, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett!  Such a laughable  proposition is untenable today, and we can now see Shaw for what he is - a  superficially amusing farceur, who squandered this modest gift on deadly  social comment, deadly because he reduced issues that effected real people  to theorems, and reduced those people to mere mouthpieces.  There is no  subtext in Shaw - everything is expounded tediously and teeth-grindingly on  the surface.   ARMS AND THE MAN is one of his better efforts, and, after an  uncertain start, settles into some nice old-style farce - hidden  identities, buffoonish heroes, scheming servants, crusty old majors; when,  though, the puppets start lecturing us on war, idealism, class, gender  etc., one's heart sinks, not because what Shaw says isn't true, but because  a letter to the Times would have been a better place to say it.  While  Wilde's plays grow with the years, seeming richer, more meaningful,  brutally satiric, bursting with complex and fluid themes, Shaw's work, in  their steadfast refusal of mystery and ambiguity, seem chilly and remote 
 I listened to a CD from the library.  Then bought the book, simply to get the one-time use ID code required to take the test.   For about 20 bucks, you get a quick guesstimate of your strengths.    I'm a bit disappointed, at the lack of direction, e.g.  Deliberative Ideation Learner Analytical Intellection...With only a small paragraph describing each strength.  If you are serious, I would suggest spending serious money.  For example, about 4 years ago, I paid $2500 for a psychologist to administer a full battery of IQ tests to my son (6 year-old taking 6 or 7 hours of tests)  For $2500 I received a 30 page detailed report on how to best teach my gifted son.  If you are looking for TRUE INSIGHT as to career change, I would think that you would be better off investing some real money.  Twenty bucks only gets you thinking about a journey, but provides little in the way of a road map.  If it happens to help you, great. To me, the book is more an appetizer than a full meal.  The website informs you that you can have additional guidance for about $2000.  If you have that kind of coin, I would advise you skip the book and have testing administered by a psychologist in your neighborhood, so that you get advice tailored specifically to YOU.    
 Really, the whole movie sucks.  Let's start from the top, the plot.  Now, as you probably know, the plot has nothing to do with the game, at all.  In fact, the only thing remotely close they have is the name, and the BFG.  The plot is genetic monsters take over some research facility and marines go in to save the day, you know the drill.  Nothing horribly bad, except for it doesn't follow the game at all.  However, this sad bunch of marines are the stupidest people on Earth, and now Mars.  Really.  First, we have the Kid, who is horrible at everything, he talks while he's supposed to be stealthy, he gets high on mission, etc.  Yes, it's his mission, but I thought this was an elite military team, not some club that just anybody off the street can join without having any military training.  And Portman, not only is a moron, but has a stupid grin on his face no matter what he's saying.    Now, as for genres.  For a horror movie, it's not scary at all, not even a little suspense (though I kinda wanted the characters to die, so I guess that lost the suspense to me).  For an action movie, well, simply put, there's little to know action, until the very end.  And yes, there's a first person shooter sequence towards the end, but don;t be fooled, that is a gimmick and nothing more.    Without spoiling anything,I'm just gonna say that the ending is incredibly generic.  All in all, this movie is a waste of time and money.  
 Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!  The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs 
 This foam product by Jonathan is okay.  The reviews on his products are highly overrated.  The price doesn't bother me at all.  There are better foams for thin and limp hair 
 Up front, let us grant that Haught gets a few things straight.  He acknowledges the impact Darwin has had on our view of life.  And the supernatural.  Many of Darwin's successors declared natural selection signalled the end of theism.  That terminal judgment will be addressed in this book, but he warns that theology must still "come to grips" with the "opulence of evolution".   From this opening he seeks to create a new theology.  In order to launch this enterprise, Haught must sweep away some obstructions.  Among these obstacles is the wave of "intelligent design" [which is neither] - Michael Behe's excuse for failing to understand how natural selecton works.  Haught dismisses Behe with ease, claiming the idea "ignores novelty".  So far, so good.  Haught then mounts his pulpit to steal a book title as a means of launching an assault on Darwin's most penetrating students, Daniel C. Dennett and Richard Dawkins.  "Darwin's Dangerous Idea" [1995] is what this book is about.  Haught flaunts the term often.  Each time, he tries to discount it, sniping at Dennett for being "prolific" and his presentation as done "in laborious detail".  The detail appears to have been too much for Haught, since he seems to have missed many of the more obvious points.  Dawkins, a much more outspoken non-theist than Dennett, if that's possible, gives Haught the vapours.  Dawkins' "selfish gene", a frequent target of theists, here undergoes the usual vilification.  It's "materialist" and "mechanistic".  When you're building a case for the supernatural, such ideas are anathema.  Perhaps even worse for Haught than the "Three-D" figures is that of Edward O. Wilson.  At least Dennett and Dawkins aren't lapsed Christians, but Wilson shed his Baptist upbringing when he discovered gods and life aren't related.  What greater betrayal could a theologian encounter?  While Haught is disparaging the non-theists, he steps back a bit.  He wants to show he's a reasonable man.  We're all good fellas, here.  He demonstrates his knowledge [such as it is] of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, but he wants to add a new element.  A deity.  Somewhere in the process some god has to be involved, he says.  Well, his god at any rate.  That step back puts him on a slippery slope.  As Haught builds his thesis, you observe him sliding down the ramp.  The ramp is labelled "sophistry" and Haught has a supreme talent for it.  He wants to create a "theology of evolution" - perhaps one of the more bizarre concepts of modern times.  Haught takes us through "laborious detail" in explaining how many philosophers and theologians have struggled to merge Darwin and a deity.  All have failed and Haught is no exception.  Haught's sophistry utilises a range of voices.  He even snares Taoism for a prop.  He finally selects two buttresses - Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin and philosopher Hans Jonas.  De Chardin's struggle to reconcile natural selection with metaphysics has been refuted too many times to recount here.  Jonas may be new to some of Haught's readers, but Haught attempts to introduce him.  A follower of Alfred North Whitehead, Jonas was also influenced by Jewish Kabbalistic thought.  He contends the deity [please note "the"] made the universe with the "promise" of life - and, one presumes, at some point would produce an intellect to observe it.  Jonas pushes this deity about as far from human ken as can be achieved and still have any meaning.  As a stretch of conceivability and expression of unreality, there are few peers.  What purpose such a deity could have remains escapes understanding - and reason.  It turns out this is the whole point - at some future time one of natural selection's products, humanity, will reach an "Omega Point" to encounter this deity.  To what end isn't explained.  Books such as Haught's are attempts to reconcile the irrational with the real.  Limited, as he is, by his Roman Catholic Christianity, he starts with a flimsy a priori stance.  He then tries to shore it up with a confusion of quotations synopsised ideas.  As we wade through his quote snippets, we learn that an event never historically justified, a crucifixion, provides one gleam of illumination for his thesis.  A dim light to steer by.

 This book is horrible and chocked full of slanted thinking (?) and outrght lies aimed at dividing this country even further. It's a sad, sad day when this is what American politics have become 
 If you have read my past reviews you know I think it is pretty worthless to actually talk about the story, but to actually talk about the enjoyment factor of reading fiction.  I mean you don't read fiction as a means of actually furthering your education or anything.  You read it because it is fun and enjoyable.  You lose yourself it the book as a 3rd party observer and go for a literary ride for a while.  Well this ride was fun for about 3/4 of the book.  After that if feels like your are on a descent roller coaster of fiction going along with the story and then 3/4 of the way through the book Stuart Woods kind of hops the track and takes you on a path that has absolutely nothing to do with the previous 250 pages.  I actually liked the beginning and middle and should have stopped there and then made up my own ending and I would have given it 3 stars.  Don't waste your time or money on this one...or do if you want to chuckle at what a silly ending the books has.  I really can't say enough at how it seems Stuart Woods just really got tired of writing this book and then just farmed out the ending to someone that hadn't actually read the first 3/4 of the book 
 I found all of the Avent cups really hard to clean!  I couldn't get the stopper out of the top of the cup.  The Playtex cups are WAY easier to use!  
 I was intrigued by the title, which supposedly links Jedi wisdom to Christianity.  Well, after 60 pages or so, I have got the feeling that the Staub is trying to wrap Jedi in Christian cloth and failing at that. The author speaks of the difficulty in leading a Christian life.  But, I say that any religious life (be it Christian, Islam or otherwise) is hard because it turns the back on the norm or the conventional.   I am convinced that Yoda is a Zen master; the Force is derived from Tao, not God as interpreted by the orthodox religion(I am purposefully leaving out Christian Mysticism, which is another beast altogether.). A better book on the subject of theology in Star wars is "The Dharma of Star Wars." 
 Have you heard?  Many Christians are seeking authentic Christian church life.  And they are leaving the institutional church (i.e. the religious buildings, empty pagan rituals, professional staff members, etc.) to experience it!    This I applaud.  Many Christians would do well to read "Pagan Christianity" by Frank Viola.  The institutional church is not the model given to us by the apostles.  And please know... I grew up a Southern Baptist and was on the ministerial staff for 6 years.  This conclusion was not all that easy to embrace.  However, I did discover it to be true.  Most truth loving people recognize the institutional church doesn't bring the results we see in the book of Acts. (e.g. read "Church Planting Movements" by David Garrison, published by the International Mission Board)  Yet, many are not willing to leave the comfortable confines of the man-centered institution to discover real ekklesia.  So... why did I rate this book so poorly if I am a part of a "house church" myself?  Because this book dishes out church in homes like it was fast-food!  Tony and Felicity Dale seem like wonderful people who have seen some great things happen in homes, but it would seem their method of starting churches is not founded in the N.T.  First, they use a proof-text (Matt.18:20) to establish the existence of a church.  A true church is a group of believers in a particular locality who have joined together in community for the purpose of gathering around Jesus Christ. (e.g. read "The Normal Christian Church Life")  A church is not just getting a couple of Christians together and doing a bible study or singing some songs. This idea is a really popular strand of "house church" that has many rushing out prematurely to do this.  These people have no real solid foundation and knowledge of the roles and workings of an apostle(church planter), prophet, pastor/teacher, etc.  In chapter 10 "IT'S OK TO START A CHURCH," the Dales encourage you to nonchalantly go out and find someone who will allow Christians to meet in their home and walla!  You will have a "house church".  Question: is this the model in Acts?  Go read it.  The Dales even admit from their experience that the life of many a "house church" does not last very long.  Why?? I believe it is because "Simply Church" is so simple it is not biblical.  If you believe that the church gathering in homes apart from the religious systems of man is what Christ and the apostles intended, then you must believe there is an order to things.  (e.g. Eph. 4:11)    However, if you believe church is a "cell group" or some other kind of alternative fellowship to the insitutional church... I imagine you can do whatever you want.  And many do.  Unfortunately, these "house churches" usually do not last.  Why would you want to trade one wrong practice (the institutional church) for another (house church as alternative)?  It is not an alternative.  It is the model given by the apostles to the community of saints.  We must be careful we do not trade one man-centered institution that meets in a building for another man-centered instituion that meets in a home!  Remember-- Real Christian church life comes by gathering around Jesus Christ in the order of the New Testament.  T. Austin Sparks puts it this way, "The church is measured by Christ: more Christ, more church; less Christ, less church."  The simplicity is found in gathering around Christ with a New Testament understanding of who we are and how we are to function within a local community of believers.  A biblical "New Testament" church comes about by a group of believers gathering around Christ the Head of the body.    The journey that you embark on in a true church... I believe can be represented in a picture.  It is a picture of believers hand-in-hand circled around the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.  This community is singing, encouraging, rebuking, correcting, and edifying for the worship of the one in the center:  Jesus Christ, the lamb who was slain!  Don't get hung up on mimicking the "first-century style" of church... be consumed with Christ!  Place him in the center.  In time... you will discover your church life is authentic.  I highly recommend you read the writings of Frank Viola if you are interested in gathering around Jesus and experiencing the freedom of the first-century church.  His book set is very helpful for those who seek to model Christianity in Acts.  He references his claims to Scripture.  Frank Viola's set: 1. "Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the N.T. Church" 2. "Who is Your Covering: A Fresh Look at Leadership, Authority, & Accountabiltiy" 3. "Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices" 4. "SO YOU WANT TO START A HOUSE CHURCH?: First-Century Styled Church Planting For Today" 5. "From Nazareth to Patmos: The Saga of the N.T. Church"  I also recommend reading: "Paul's Idea of Community: The Early House Churches in their Cultural Setting" by Robert Banks "The Normal Christian Church Life" by Watchman Nee "Life Together: The Classic Exploration of Faith in Community" by Dietrich Bonhoeffer "God's Ultimate Passion" by Frank Viola "The Untold Story of the New Testament Church" by Frank Viola * "The Release of the Spirit" by Watchman Nee 
 I disagree with all others who reviewed this album. This album is somewhat decent for its time ('94) but overall, the beats are garbage. I think Eiht really stepped up his game when he came out with Death Threatz. The beats on that album are great and I give that album 5 stars 
 I disliked this book.Too many people reading the book might not go to a doctor to heal.I think that some foods can help you,but I strongly believe in doctors 
 this was the worst music that sounded like david bowie.  i can't believe these guys have even gotten a record deal....oh the humanit 
 except not as good.  You'd have to be a HUGE Dekker fan to get into this book.  Not suspenseful.  It's as cliched as it is confusing, which is quite an accomplishment 
 I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers.  I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her.  Now I'm not so sure.  This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring.  Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out.  I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice.  If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end. 
 for soliciting prostitutes and drug buys!  In his own city, he practiced self-hate, hypocrisy, and bigotry.   How very, very "christian!"  But now that he's gone from his mega-mall church, those "christians" left behind can still practice those godly virtues on their own.    
 This DVD skips quite a bit, making it hard to relax for what should be an enjoyable movie.  Also, the plastic covering on the DVD casewas torn a little bit when the security sticker was taken off.  I've never had a movie do that before.  I would think twice in the future before buying movies from Amazon.com 
 If you're looking for real, useful information on starting a home inspection business, or becoming a better home inspector this book won't help you much. It doesn't take long before you realize the person writing this is not a home inspector. Mostly filler, with very little content. The "how to start your own business" tips can be applied to ANY business & are very basic. I got so frustrated with the lack of information I just stopped reading it 2/3 of the way thru 
 In the vein of "contemporary gay fiction" I must say that there are many other books worth buying before this one. The fairytale quality of the plot is cute at best, but the dialogues ... are pretty awful. Everything about this book pointed to the eventual deception that I felt, so I suppose it was not that surprising. If you have a long flight (and you count on sleeping a little, but not too much...) this is a perfect choice 
 I thought I had never met a book on statistics I didn't like (i.e., find something useful therein), until I met this book. I bought it in spite of other reviews that mentioned glaring errors that had not been fixed. I felt I knew enough about statistics to fix the errors, and I was interested primarily in the application of statistics to toxicology, for which topic few good texts exist. However, I could never have imagined the monumental scale of the corrections needed.  In this book (supposedly in its 3rd edition), in my opinion there is essentially NOTHING in the text without errors and omissions, except possibly the SAS programs given, which are possibly useful to the neophyte in SAS. Formulae are unintelligible, missing parentheses and using improper symbols and typesetting. Symbols are referenced that are never defined, etc. Apparently the author just created a montage of clips from other works without regard to antecedent explanation and had zero concern for correctness (he should be ashamed).   Finally, in my opinion, the author does not appear from his writings to be the expert in the field that one would expect from the book title. He does appear to be a toxicologist, but his knowledge of statistics appears rudimentary and confused.  I was truly disappointed by this book, because my needs remain unsatisfied. Its true value lies solely in the table of contents (so you can look up elsewhere the techniques referenced) and the SAS program snippets. Everything else is untrustworthy, incomplete and generally contaminated by errors. If the author cared the least bit about accuracy and content, he could have made his book enormously more useful in the 1st, 2nd or 3rd edition. The eternal optimist may hope for this in the 4th edition 
 If you are looking for insight on how to build your business, this is not the right book.  It may be useful for young people or emerging artists.  Many of the tips are related to life skills.  The tips are presented simplisticly.  They are not particularly helpful for artists already in the marketplace.  
 I thought this book was going to include style tips and more how to's than it did. It had some how to's but not for interior design. (Incidentally, there are no photographs in this book, just some simple drawings. How can you write a book on interior design without including any pictures?) The book was also chock full of Emily Post style tips on writing letters, making time for yourself without feeling guilty, what kind of foods to prepare when, and tons of other little feel-good snippets. If you want great tips on interior design, find a better book than this one 
 This book is very religious. I would return it but the shipping and handling costs more than the book itself. Stay away from this book unless you want a book totally based on the christian way of life 
 Harsh words but I suppose I expected the music to be stronger than it was....   
 I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know 
 Douglas Adams' reading of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is truly engaging. The problem with this audio book is two-fold:  1. None of the tracks has any text-encoding. This means that devices that read this information cannot use or display the CD names or track names. So, an iTunes won't read any CD names or track names, nor will any CD player that can show CD names or track names.  2. CD #6 of the set repeats the same scene over and over, without ever reaching the ending.   New Millenium Audio destroyed a perfectly enjoyable performance with its poor mastering of the CD 
 I had respect for Prof. Wheeler, and so this book came as a tremendous disappointment. It does little but trot out all the latest fringe 'theories' about a woman who has already been the subject of numerous myths  and dubious theories already 
 I recently started reading books on theoretical phycics, so I am no expert in the field.  Nevertheless I found the book quite intersting at times but it has one major flaw that is inexcusable: no illustrations.  I guess the writer was purposely trying to confuse his readers; I mean, some parts were very easy to understand, written in layman's terms and giving good examples.  However, there are parts in the book that NEEDED drawings.  Also, the book tends to talk in circles 
 I was interested in reading this book after seeing an interview with the author (Stephen Singular) on CNN.  However, as soon as I started reading this book it was obvious that the author Singular delves to far into self indulgence time and time again.    At times it seems he is simply writing just for the sake of writing, often times describing the weather and a truly ridiculous paragraph about a certain crop that was imported into the Wichita area.  And there is also a strong christian viewpoint the author is writing from, which grows rather tiresome.  For anyone that is interested in true crime books, pass on this one, or at least wait until it comes out in paperback (I wasted over $20.00 dollars on this book). 
 I would NEVER recommend this book to anyone.  I threw away my copy when I was through reading it so that I wouldn't be responsible for anyone else wasting their time with it.  I found the book to be tedious, mind-numbingly redundant, misogynistic & racist.  The main character whines about the state of society oblivous to the fact he is one of the horribly twisted reasons why society is the way it is. There were no surprises to be found anywhere in the book since the author apparently mistook foreshadowing for plot AND character, thus focusing mainly on foreshadowing.  In case we readers are too thick to miss any of it, repetition pounds it into our heads.  I found nothing new or noteworthy in this book 
 Axiomatics and superstition make a bilious mix. The book has an extremely narrow ideological focus pandering to the hardcore religious right.  Another sad attempt to set the clock back. 
 I am a classical fencing student and a fan of the works of Alexandre Dumas. I was really excited when I found out that he had written this book. Unfortunately, the story has nothing to do with fencing and everything to do with Russian history and architecture. The protagonist happens to be a fencing master, but that's all. If you're actually looking to read a novel about a fencing master, I would suggest Master at Arms by Rafael Sabatini 
 In many ways, Yungen's book is good.  It rasies serious questions about the influence of Eastern thought and metaphysics in modern Christianity, and some of his points are quite valid.  However the conclusions that he draws regarding cnetering prayer eventually become very tenuous and downright tangential.  To be blunt, his reasoning goes like this:     A: Eastern mystics chant mantras ("om")    B: Contemplative prayer sometimes involves repeating a word or phrase ("Jesus")    C: A=B, therefore contemplative prayer is un-Christian Another form of his reasoning:    A: Eastern religion influenced the Desert Fathers    B: the Desert Fathers influenced Thomas Merton    C: Thomas Merton influenced Richard Foster    D: Richard Foster influenced Rick Warren    E: therefore Rick Warren believes in Eastern religion  Please read this book critically if you read it at all 
 If you want to read a book with a lot of information about a strange, mentally-ill woman who claimed throughout her entire life that she was the daughter of Czar Nicolas II, you might find "Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson" interesting. However, if you are looking for an objective, unbiased view of this strange story, look elsewhere. Peter Kurth is a man obsessed. He is besotted with the fairytale lost Princess; he finds her utterly captivating, believes her tales wholeheartedly. Of course, there are some people who do not share his affection for the haughty, irrational, temperamental woman who treated everyone as though they were her personal servant, and do not believe her incredible tale of escape from the cellar at Ekaterinburg. Kurth expresses obvious distain for anyone who does not believe that Anderson is Anastasia. He portrays her supporters and detractors thus: people who believe Anderson's claim are credible, people who don't believe her are not credible and have a secret agenda. He is a firm believer than Anderson was never recognized as Anastasia because if that ever came to pass, political careers would be ruined, the royal hierarchy would be shaken to the foundations and the vast hidden Romanov fortune would be given to it's rightful owner, ANASTASIA! He claims (not in this book) that the DNA evidence is a fraud, that the blocks of tissue and hair that had DNA extracted from it may have been tampered with or replaced. Pretty crazy, but then Anderson's supporters have always been a strange lot. There is no evidence, none whatsover, of her tale of rescue by a Russian soldier; you had to take it on "faith". There is no evidence that there ever was a Romanov fortune hidden away in a bank or banks in Europe. The supporters insist to this day that there is a conpiracy still going on to prevent those mysterious millions from being handed over to the rightful owner; one Anastasia fanatic said that since Anastasia and her husband are both dead, the millions now belong to her husband's second wife, a LAWYER, who would certainly have the legal knowledge to successfully sue to retain the fortune. Only trouble is the fortune NEVER EXISTED. Crazy. Towards the end of the book, Kurth rather glosses over the fact that Anderson and her husband were as looney as bedbugs; they both were what is known today as "hoarders". Their house and property was a health hazard and stunk to high heaven, due to piled up junk and garbage and the feces and urine of God knows how many cats. When one of the cats would die, Anderson would cremate it in the fireplace. The supporters of Anna Anderson who in spite of definitive, conclusive evidence continue to insist she was the daughter of the Russian royal family are not unusual, really; there are many people who need to believe in something they have no proof exists. Some of them believe in space aliens; some believe there is a creature they call Bigfoot. Some believe there is a large sea monster living in Loch Ness; some believe Elvis Presley is still alive. And some believe a deranged woman, with similar physical characteristies of a dead young girl, was a Princess. Another thing about Peter Kurth; I wrote an email asking why he persisted in trying to convince people that Anna Anderson was Anastasia. He wrote back a nasty reply; he barked that he never SAID she was Anastasia, only that HE believed he was Anastasia. Of course, this is quite untrue; he has a rant on the internet right now where he tries to discredit the DNA evidence and put forth the idea that the DNA samples were flawed, etc. He sounds like a very disturbed man 
 I started potty training my daughter at the age of 10 months. All I've read about this book, promised that I would find guidance and tips on how to make my baby comfortable with the potty, but it's all theory there with "Hallmark" type stories. Some quotations are aggressive against modern American society and parents using disposable diapers. It even made me feel guilty and ashamed rather than enouraging. I come from culture where children are potty trained from birth. My parents started it when I was 3 months old. This book made me feel like I was lazy to postpone it till my daughter turned 10 mo. I found no guidance and no real tips. Only theory about how going in diaper is bad for health and Pampers corp. is evil. I regret for buying this book 
 The story is incomplete and confusing. There are considerable gaps without a parent, adult or smart kid adding additional explanations as the story goes along. If you haven't seen the film you would find yourself scratching your head. Shame on Pixar and Disney for allowing such a poorly written book to be published. If your kid doesn't read, the pictures, frames right out of the cartoon, are great. (The two stars are for the pictures.) But, where were the editors? Is the assumption that kids don't read anyway, so who's going to notice? Well anyway, here's to the illiterates: the one's who call themselves editors and the one's they are cultivating 
 Abraham Lincoln's law partner once wanted to read some maudlin poetry to Abe.  Once he was done, Lincoln said "The people who like this sort of thing will find it the sort of thing they like."  Beaches is fine.  It is obviously a chick flick.  Bette Midler has some real opportunities to sing.  The acting is good.  The problem is that the plot is so predictable 
 This is a good book, but most are under the impression that Einstein actually CREATED the content of the book.  Einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest German and Italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory.  For instance, e=mc^2 was not created by Einstein, as so many people people. An Italian physicist came up with it. If you don't believe me check any encyclopedia.  Einstein suceeded in taking everyone's work and compiling it. This was helpful to the world of physics.  Unfortunately, this stuff is outdated, and Autodynamics has disproven many things that Einstein says in this book. When it came out it was already outdated. This was published in the 60s. Autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s (45 I believe). If this was published in the 20s or even the 30s, it would have been a good book 
 This is one of those books that's so bad you can use it to judge critics -- because if *anybody* says it's well written, or well plotted, or has good characterizations, THEY'RE NUTS.  The fact is, there's NO characterization, the sentence constructions are painful, and at least one major plot point is impossible.  (If you're paying even a minimum of attention, you'll put the book down and go, "HUH?")  This book is good for exactly one thing:  it shows you don't have to spend a lot of time writing a book -- or even be a competent writer -- to have a best seller.  I don't mind mindless escapism -- heck, I'll give Janet Evanovitch two thumbs WAY up -- but when it's a trash heap like this it gives reading a bad name 
 The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to "preserve the life that is dear to him."  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of "24," but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write "Sunday," we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne 
 I kept watching this hoping a plot would eventually come up. But it didnt . 
 Thank goodness I just checked this book out of the library and didn't buy it!  This book barely provides one helpful strategy, and instead is more about theories and case studies.  In the foreward she mentions that this book is best read BEFORE you have a second child.  Well, I have a feeling most people are not that proactive, and instead start looking for help once their kids start fighting and really struggling with sibling rivalry.  Skip this book and find another one!  
 The Stephen Mitchell version of the Tao Te Ching will please the philosophical bent and Weltanschauung of certain modern and post-modern readers. On points it is extremely Spinozan. To recognize that many readers will like it, perhaps like it a great deal, is not to suggest that it is an 'authentic' translation, because it is not. To Mitchell's credit, he acknowledges this (after a fashion, at least). He thinks he is relating what Lao Tzu really meant to say to 20th century readers. Certain 21st century western readers may agree with Mitchell, but I expect that most scholars will not.  The prospective reader should be aware that this is the Way of Stephen Mitchell, which, at least on some points, is not the Way of the "ancient masters." I strongly suggest that this NOT be the first or the only 'version' of the Tao Te Ching that you read. In fact, [assuming that you prefer not to be misled] I suggest that you don't read it at all. The [authentic] Tao Te Ching is a fascinating text, counter-intuitive and challenging, worthy of our contemplation and puzzlement thousands of years after its writing. This volume isn't. 
 I absolutely love Oklahoma - one of my all-time favorites! Too bad the display is reduced to a thin 6" wide ribbon, leaving 2/3 of the screen blank. I'd really like to see product descriptions indicate the viewing size, or lack thereof! There's no way I'd purchase a mini-screen marvel if I knew better 
 It worked OK for 2 months, but the KB kept on falling off. When I complained, I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37. Yet, it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002. The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working. I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC.  I do not believe that this should be permitted. If you sell something, stand behind it.   Very disappointing 
 I listened to a CD from the library.  Then bought the book, simply to get the one-time use ID code required to take the test.   For about 20 bucks, you get a quick guesstimate of your strengths.    I'm a bit disappointed, at the lack of direction, e.g.  Deliberative Ideation Learner Analytical Intellection...With only a small paragraph describing each strength.  If you are serious, I would suggest spending serious money.  For example, about 4 years ago, I paid $2500 for a psychologist to administer a full battery of IQ tests to my son (6 year-old taking 6 or 7 hours of tests)  For $2500 I received a 30 page detailed report on how to best teach my gifted son.  If you are looking for TRUE INSIGHT as to career change, I would think that you would be better off investing some real money.  Twenty bucks only gets you thinking about a journey, but provides little in the way of a road map.  If it happens to help you, great. To me, the book is more an appetizer than a full meal.  The website informs you that you can have additional guidance for about $2000.  If you have that kind of coin, I would advise you skip the book and have testing administered by a psychologist in your neighborhood, so that you get advice tailored specifically to YOU.    
 This one got way too much attention from NPR. I loved the interview there with the author, but, quite frankly, his entire story was told in that very sitting. This "book" is really an "essay" that doesn't deserve all the paper it's printed on; I would've been much more appreciative of this author's sentiments had it been marketed more appropriately 
 I ordered this item and it stated that they were in stock.  Three weeks later I received a note from Amazon stating they could not locate one to ship to me and that my order had been canceled.  I was forced to go to an actual book store and buy it.  They were able to locate it for me 
 The worst book ever written about the Middle East is probably Joan Peters' From Time Immemorial; in this book Alan Dershowitz not only attempts to usurp that dubious honor from Peters, he also heavily plagiarizes half her book in order to do so.  The man who has made a career and a fortune as a lawyer mastering the art of defending and exonerating the guilty turns his gaze onto one of the international community's leading delinquents and most prolific violators of International Human Rights Law, International Humanitarian Law and UN Resolutions.  His defending of nation states, however, is as unconvincing as his knowledge of historical events is laughable.  Joan Peters' book was completely demolished and shown to be a fraud by Norman Finkelstein, and even the most ardent of Zionists have openly admitted the book is worthless.  20 years after that book faded into oblivion, Alan Dershowitz plagiarized much of its nonsensical arguments to masquerade as a book of his own.  For a full documentation of this plagiarism, see Norman Finkelstein's personal website.  By writing this book, Dershowitz has inflicted more damage on Israel than a thousand books criticizing it ever could.  Any neutral who would read this book would realize how shoddy The Case for Israel really is; both the book and the `case' that Dershowitz presents are nothing more than a pathetic assortment of lies, bigoted arguments, idiocies, misrepresentations and highly elaborate intellectual scams. 
 This chair is very comfortable, but I don't think the leather is real. The seat ripped before one month was up from purchase. It was easy to assemble, but not worth the money.  
 I'm very disappointed in this book, although some information IN it is valuable, it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover. It is an excellent Textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular  basis and find ideas for what you need. Although broken into sections, they  are not readily found or visible. One must search the information needed as  in a research assignment. The reproducibles are MAINLY for elementary  grades. This was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it's  contents, on-line. Although the price was reasonable, I'm not pleased with  the way the book is organized & printed 
 Despite my one-star rating, this is an acceptable time-killer: good-natured, forgettable and not real bright.  Poor Hilary Swank - from that movie where she was a boy to this in a few short years.  Of course, her fall wasn't as steep as Cuba Gooding's (from Jerry Maguire to Boat Trip in one movie) or Jamie Foxx's (from Ray to Stealth in one movie).  She looks like Jolene Blalock - T'Pol from TV's Star Trek Enterprise, and it wasn't until the credits that I realized it was actually Swank and not Blalock in the movie.  Perhaps Swank was trying to camouflage herself.  The movie begins with a space shuttle landing in the LA River, which is interesting, but has nothing at all to do with the rest of the movie.  Next thing you know, the valiant pilot is recruited to some mission to drill to the center of the earth to restart the core, which got some spyware or something and stopped working.  As a result, the Coliseum and the Golden Gate Bridge get wiped out by lightning.  Don't ask.  The Feds then assemble a team to take a magic vehicle to the core, drop some nukes, and reboot the earth.    We learn some interesting things on the way, such as: Molten rock is completely clear.  There are really unconvincing sets with big fake crystals deep inside the earth.  And, if you're a jerk, you'll get killed by rolling nuclear weapons and then repent.    You can guess how it ends.  It's not great art, but it's dumb fun on a rainy day 
 Although this book contains good information, it is tinted by the fact that one of the authors, Robert Portman, sells sports nutrition products. As a result, the impression is that the goal of this book is to prove that Mr. Portman's products are the best. Maybe they are but then, it would be more credible if the book was written by independent researchers 
 I have been using Cross product for lat 15 years. This product which is Made in China, has highly disappointed me. The finish of the pen is very poor. Gold plating is  of a poor quality. It has some patches of a different color. The body has sharp edges. Overall it has spoilt my impression about Cross products.  Regards R.P. Kal 
 The filters that I got are poorly finished.  The 812 filter has a smudge on it, while all 3 filters don't screw on properly on my lens.  All filters come off EASILY.  They are totally useless.  I suggest that you buy filters in a real store so you can try them on your lens 
 Is it really worth it? I mean sacrifice your reputation which you worked for 30 years for another million bucks 
 While parts of this book were very thought-provoking, too many details were either left out or skimmed over to allow this book to stand alone.  For example, the formula the author supplies to calculate the eccentricity  of a simplex couldn't possibly produce the results he gives in the  adjoining table; some are infinite, and the formula as he states is  specifically designed to avoid such results. If you're really interested in  catastophe theory or chaos theory, make sure you read this book where you  have other reference materials on hand 
 A rather disappointing compact version of the much better larger format Larousse dictionary. I bought it for travel purposes, and was alarmed at how many French words I encountered on signs, in newspapers and elsewhere which were not in this dictionary. If you're serious about the language, this pocket dictionary is less than satisfying. Even for casual references, I found it less than helpful 
 This was a much anticipated and very disappointing reading experience.  Ms. Forrest is an excellent writer, but this latest effort should not be listed as a lesbian novel, nor as a romance.  It reminds you of the 50's when a lesbian character is thrown in for attention.  If Daughters of an Amber Moon had been the first book, then Daughters of a Corral Dawn would never have had to be written as a sequel because no one would have cared about the other group of women.  This is mainstream writing making money posing as lesbian literature.  The fact that Ms. Forrest is a lesbian does not make her writing lesbian.  In the last few years, her books have become more and more mainstream sanitized.  Daughters of an Amber Moon proves once again that you cannot buy a book just by the author's name.  Characters are not well developed and no one the reader identifies with or gets close to emotionally.  Writing skill is good.  Subject and characterization is not.  I would not buy this book again, nor recommend it to my friends 
 OK, this book isn't really bad. But it has very, very little to do with debugging. Most of the book is given over to general software engineering (requirements, design, coding and test). Perhaps 1/4 of the book is really about debugging, and that seems to consist of two things - logging and tracing - over and over again.  Another thing that I found that grated on my nerves was the incessant references to the holy grail (allegedly) of computing, the 'production server'. I also assume that this is implicitly a 'windoze production server', since the authors seem to be of the opinion that if you even think of installing some software or patch on the server, then you are doomed to have all sorts of problems. They don't even seem to consider the possibility of running tools over the network, without installing them on the sacrosanct server machines.  There is zero coverage of debug tools (they say "read the manual of your debugger"). They do include code coverage, memcheck, source browser and defect tracking as debug tools. I wouldn't.  If you want a book that DOES cover debugging (and also some general software engineering, but less overwhelmingly so), then take a look at "Why Programs Fail" by Andreas Zeller 
 Once Upon a Time is a lament of the loss of the old ways. While it does have Sloane's trademark illustrations and observations, it constantly compares the old to the inferior modern ways. Written in 1982, not all the complaints still apply, and they detract from his usual, loving description of early America.  I grew up with A Reverance for Wood and A Museum of Early American Tools, which I always loved. This book is not up to the standard that Sloane set with his earlier work 
 This book is very slow moving. You must be truely concerned with the matter he is talking about to actually understand or even want to read it 
 Before clicking the link on this page for this film I knew that someone would say VERY BAD MOVIE, OR VERY BAD FILM, it is awful, but me and my friend use to laugh when we'd mention the title of this film and at the end when he's spinning around in a wheelchair. How can some of the best actors be in such a film, great cast, bad script, bad movie, it's stupid, and very violent, there are parts that are funny though like when Daniel Stern says "Have you done this before"? when he knew what to do with the body. Yes it is awful, it really is. The darkest "comedy" ever, they went way too far. It's almost as sick as the movie FREEWAY another movie with great actors in such a terrible film. Atrocious films. 
 There are hundreds of Self-Help books out there.  Some are useful.  This is not one of them.  The book is structured around five supposedly sequential parts: Part I Discover it [your gift], Part II Develop it, etc...  But, there is little substance to it.  The book is nearly 300 pages long, but each page tells the same thing: find out what you want to do, and do it.  It shares tens of biographical examples that have the same pattern: An individual overcame the odds of a miserable childhood to become most successful in life through determination.  The profiled characters include Lance Armstrong, Abraham Lincoln, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mother Theresa, and Mahatma Gandhi.  That's inspirational but not informational.    I judge a self-help book by its usefulness.  Does the author convey practical insights beyond the self-evident?  Is the advice original?  (Or, has it been stated many times before).  Has this book changed my perspective, attitude, and knowledge?  The response is no.   Let me recommend other books instead.  Unlike Souza who keeps you guessing, Marcus Buckingham allows you to readily identify your talents in "Now Discover Your Strength."  While Souza keeps you dreaming, Stephen Covey tells you concretely how to give your life purpose in "The Seven Habits of Effective People."   
 I bought this shaver last September, and at that point I agreed with the other reviewers. It delivered a nick-free shave and was quick and painless to use. This past May, it stopped being able to re-charge and just died completely. I only used the recommended cleaning solution, changed it according to the instructions, and cleaned it after every use. I sent the shaver back to Remington, they were very nice and sent a new replacement shaver after a few weeks. It worked wonderfully, for about 2 months when the same problem occurred again! I'm sending it back again and hoping for a refund this time, it isn't worth my time and money to go to the post office every few months to return yet another defective shaver! 
 A lot of hype and nonsense showing how feminists extremists view the night life scene in Bangkok.  From their fanatical point of view only.  And of course when one of their own disagrees with them, such as, Cleo Oldzer, rather than question themselves, they dump on her.  These people remind me of the academics in the play Equus, who had no hope of enjoying life.  A very boring book in which they love to babble about "tropes."  Well, sweetiepies, trope THIS 
 Edward Hirsch has written a meticulous analysis of the art of poetry, imbued with an authentic love of the form. From page to page he dissects and interprets; his enthusiasm remains high throughout. Not just the poetry, but also the poets themselves are lavished with heroic praise, their craft transcending the mortal. Their words are golden strands of virtue more appropriately whispered into the ears of gods.  But, but...  For those of us uneducated in the art of poetry there is a much more basic level of understanding that has to be achieved first: Why no punctuation? Why do sentences break in mid-breath? How does one find the meter in a poem? How does one read poetry without the stops and starts from line to line? Perhaps we should have learned this in school, but we didn't, so we bought this book.  This is a good book, really, but it is not what its title suggests. It should rather be entitled "The Love of Poetry", or "Falling in Love With Poetry", or "Furthering Your Love of Poetry", or something else emotive. "How to Read a Poem" sounds mechanical, the basics, just what those uneducated among us get when we do a keyword search on how to read a poem.  Select another book in order to learn how to read a poem, then graduate to this one once you comprehend the basics. 
 There are no really good songs on this cd.  i am not writing an indepth review of each song because all are just self indulgences for Kate Bush.  This is an ode to her ego.  The only true great cd which I bought 3 copies were 'The Hounds of Love'.  Nearly every song was great.  And the video of 'cloudbursting' from the cd was wonderful with an apperance by Donald Sutherland as her father.  Her next album , I beleive 'Ruberband Girl' had one good song written for an 80's movie 'She's having a Baby' called 'This Woman's work' as the only great song and a few were decent.    But her new CD is frankly bad.  But since I loved 'Hounds of Love' so much, I still have hope for Kate and gave her two stars.  Just don't stay away fromm the studio so long.  It's like everything else, practice and perfect your kraft or lose the talent 
 The information presented in this book is compact and difficult to understand. I am using this book in my undergraduate class right now and I have to re-read sections over a few times before I start to understand the material. I'd recommend getting another text if you are unfortunate enough to use such a book in your class. I'd recommend getting Micheal Sipser's book on Automata theory. The point of a text is to be clear and concise to the reader, but Martin's book falls short on both 
 I just saw this today in 2 stores (both priced at 19.99), and both stores had a lot of these games, also ebay  has a ton of these going for less than $20!  This price is absolutely ridiculous!!! 
 Hardly any bass, tinny treble, not natural-sounding for acoustic instruments, concert/jazz bands, and string orchestras. Don't get these, go with Philips HS500 or Sennheiser PMX60 instead. Both sound much better than this 
 It's a beautiful book but it's poorly organized for those people unfamilar with all the Japanese ingredient. She refers to the same item by several names which is very confusing. Also she need to do a better job explaining what you need to have to prepare her recipes. She make a point of explaining the different types of miso but then just calls for "miso" in the reciepe. If you knew enough to understand what type of miso to use you wouldn't need her book 
 	Is it possible to experience a life crisis as a "twenty something?" Authors Alexandra Robbins and Abby Wilner assert that not only does such a crisis exist, but also that it is comparable to what is commonly known as a mid-life crisis, only with 20-something issues. In their book, Quarterlife Crisis, Alexandra Robbins and Abby Wilner share stories and vignettes about lives and issues of twenty five year-olds they call Quarterlifers. Robbins and Wilner feel that if Quarterlifers deal with the crisis now, they might be able to avoid a midlife crisis. The book shares Quarterlifers' thoughts, attitudes, and motivations toward work, personal development, friends, family, and relationships.   Judging by the stories, Quarterlifers seem surprised and disappointed to learn that negotiating today's economic landscape requires more savvy than can be acquired through academic success. They are disheartened to learn that following what led to success for Gen Xers does not necessarily yield the same results for them. This book's perspective seems to be that Quarterlifers are entitled to those results no matter what the current economic environment.   Quarterlifers grew up in a stable financial market, with families that could afford such amenities as in-home personal computers; fast internet access; cable TV with hundreds of stations; cell phones; and PlayStation. Quarterlifers embrace a materialistic lifestyle that relies on creature comforts, and have not considered the possibility of life without them. Their emphasis on materialism causes Quarterlifers to fear going off on their own where they might have to give up luxuries they consider life's staples.   Unlike previous generations, and generations since, Gen Xers came of age in a time when graduates with academic success were wooed with $100,000 starting salaries and stock options. Gen Xers were placed in mentoring programs; their college debts were paid by their company, and they quickly climbed the corporate ladder. With the dotcom boom, many Gen Xers expected to be millionaires by the time they were age 35, and some of them actually were.  This is not so for Quarterlifers, the rewards of academic success no longer guarantee career or financial stability. Quarterlifers feel they have followed the prescribed route to success and have been deprived of the rewards. Quarterlifers' response is to feel alone, isolated, anxious, and depressed. Somehow Quarterlifers feel they are unique, and find it difficult to accept that theirs is the angst of most generations as they enter the early adult stage of life.   In spite of their emphasis on comfort, Quarterlifers are often hesitant to seek the relief professional help could provide. Such support could assist Quarterlifers in letting go of another barrier: their belief that decisions are irrevocable, that a decision made is a decision forever. As is their style, Quarterlifers find comfort in sharing their frustrations with peers in a threaded discussion on a web site developed for the book: http://www.quarterlifecrisis.com/.   Quarterlifers are a powerful demographic group, soon to become a third larger than the largest demographic group to precede them, the Baby Boomers. Like previous generations, most Quarterlifers will successfully navigate their 20-somethings. While we wait for them to complete this journey, the book Quarterlife Crisis offers a glimpse into the minds of young adults that is both provocative and insightful. 
 Whether lounging in a field of mustard flowers, waxing drunk in an affected "traveler's accent" on the, ahem, realness of reality, or mumbling about Chartres Cathedral and the fallibility of man, "who must, in the end, die," Orson Welles slurs his way through this pathetic attempt to embody his "Grand Old Boy" superego like that drunken brother in law, tolerated, but only for your sister's sake. Every five minutes I expected apneatic snoring to interrupt his incessant, rambling narration. I can only conclude that these disturbances were removed in post-production. Too bad -- like drunk uncle Zane passing out in the middle of explaining the whole, damn 9-11 conspiracy, these somnolent interruptions would have provided a blessed intermission during which to run to the other side of the house and hope to god he sleeps it off.   
 Okay, I read this book end-to-end. Disappointing though. The contents are not close to what you find in the Project+ exam. The heading, subheading and paragraphs are not coherent and they do not tie together. It is hard to find out, in few paragraphs, what author is trying to tell. Chapter summaries are disorganized and sometime do not cover what is in the chapter. Some of the figures do not make sense (see figure 6-5 on page 189...do you really need to create a figure to tell Arguments take a project off schedule and increase costs) 
 I am reviewing this book from the standpoint of military history.  With that in mind, I rate this book as a two.  While it is written in a style conducive to imparting informaton to newcomers to the field, it unfortunately concentrates far too much emphasis on the wrong areas.  I'm speaking specifically of the Second World War chapter; Canada played a vital role in three major operations in NW Europe - Normandy, the Scheldt and the Rhineland.  Normandy is mentioned in passing and the latter two are not mentioned at all.    The focus of the chapter is on Dieppe - two entire pages.  While Dieppe is of course a focus of national attention, it was not the only chapter in military history and the book is very misleading by suggesting that it was.  Canada had five divisions in the field by 1944, fighting for 22 months in Italy and 11 months in NW Europe.  Why a 9 hour battle would get two pages and some 33 months of fighting get only a brief paragraph describing the casualty rates in Italy is beyond comprehension.  A page is also devoted to Conscription - and the information presented is accurate and again, well written - but again highlights failed policy rather than successful military operations.  Another two pages are devoted to the Internment camps and the Holocaust.  Important subjects, but again done at the expense of our positive military achievements.  The Battle of Normandy destroyed the German Army in France beyond recovery.  The Battle of the Scheldt cleared the waterways to Antwerp and allowed desperately needed supplies onto the continent at a location much closer to the front (the Allies were using more gasoline trucking supplies from the Normandy beachhead than the gasoline they were using for fighting).  The Battle of the Rhineland paved the way for the final crossing of the last major obstacle to a general Allied advance into Germany itself.  These were dramatic battles in which Canadians paid a grave cost and yet acquitted itself very well.  None of this is mentioned in the book, and those truly ignorant of history - the people this book is aimed at - would have no clue what the Canadian military achieved and instead walk away with the understanding that Canada's WW II effort was largely a litany of failed political decisions, interspersed with the occasional massacre of our own men.  Disappointing, especially since other areas are covered in better detail by the same author.  Perhaps the fault lies with the editor, but either way, I recommend caution in purchasing this book, especially if interested in military history 
 I haven't read many books written by Patterson but I liked The Notebook so I thought I would read some of his other publications.  I didn't find much to like about At First Sight.  The story is totally unbelievable and the characters one-dimensional. It is a boiler plate romance novel. The couple are immediately attracted to each other but something keeps them apart. A wave of a wand and they both know they love each other. The happy couple then find and overcome adversity.   Patterson is not a bad writer. If you are looking to escape from the daily grind and want to find romance in an easy read, you won't be disappointed.  If you want a realistic story and believeable characters, then At First Sight isn't for you 
 'Advances in Agronomy, Volume 73', left me bewildered. Nowhere in the text did I find reference to the well-researched fact that those who practice agronomy, and who have been convicted of it, are usually recidivists who can never be rehabilitated. So therefore, how has the topic been advanced? Society should be protected from agronomists and their vile deeds. I might sound harsh, but I say that all agronomists should be locked up for life and rendered hormonally inert through the administration of impulse-destroying chemicals. 
 The whole book just meandered from the get-go, never going anywhere.  One could surmise early who would be killed and who the killer would be, but the murder was certainly an afterthought.  I'm also tired of Qwill's relationship with the boring Polly.  And the great number of times he mentions his mustache.  A great disappointment!  -- Pa 
 Reading this book (until chapter six, where the book picks up somewhat), I thought to myself, "Why does my teacher hate me so? Does he find interest in learning about someone getting a bad headache from lack of coffee (which takes up an entire chapter)?" This book offers a different look at the Civil War. A boring one. Written 100 years after the Civil War ended (1968), this book set the precedent of "don't write about the Civil War if you aren't going to talk about battles, because it's boring." Read something interesting with your ever-disappearing life 
 I love all of these songs, and I was really hoping this would be my "one stop" Elvis CD,  but I must say this CD was mastered poorly. It sounds tinny and hollow to me.  It seems they put "the King" front and center, and left the band behind.  His voice is clear and loud, but the music is way in the background, and in some places you can barely hear the band.  I'm no re-master expert, but I can tell when something sounds out of proportion.  Pass on this one.  I would not recommend.   
 There are alot of good tips in this book, however it is poorly organized.  I felt like I was reading a church cookbook, where everyone submitted something and everything was included, even if the same thing had already been said 10 times.  It is very frustrating to read 
 This book it not so good for ordinary people. Its moore fore more advanced investors 
 Hwere we have a guilty concience trying to make himself feel better by justifying in helping a murder go free. The arguemnnts are weak and stupid and do nothing to refute the overwhelming blood evidence. What is more is that after the criminal trial so much additional evidence has been exposed that only proves even more how guilty this man is.  A few reviewers seem rather confused.  One reviewer suggested that mark fuhrman discovered both gloves. Not true! The glove at the bundy crime scene was in full view of numerous police officals before fhurman even showed up. Those gloves were a rare isotoner product of which only 240 extra lg were sold at one store in the united states. Bloomingdales in ny and credit card receipts prove that OJ owned 2 pair. I wonder how many other los angelas residents owned any of those 240 pairs of gloves sold 4 years ago in new york? Not many? Where would mark fhurman even get a pair of he wanted them and how in the hell did he know OJ's glove size?  Another reviewer suggested the crime was commited at 11:15 which is interesting because simpson's own defense team suggested the murders took place around 10:40. The discrepancy of time comes from when witnesses heard nicole's dark frantically barking. Witnesses saw nicoles dog barking nonstop with blood on her chest area at around 10:30-10:40. Where did the blood come from if ther murders have not been commited yet?   That same lame brained reviewer also said that OJ had nary a scratch on him. Really? What about the severe cut on his left middle finger that bled all over his property? In simpson's interview with police the next day he actually volunteers that he cut himself getting something out of his car. Cut himself at around the exact time the murders were commited? What a one in a million coincidence.  What about all of OJs blood at the crime scene? What about ron and nicole's blood in OJ's bronco? What about blood from all three on the rockingham property? Who was that running behind OJ's house bumping into the airconditioner at around 10:45 if it wasn't OJ frantically returning from the murders? Who was that 6 foot 200 lb black man the limo driver identified as walking into OJ's house at around 10:50?    Only idiots and the ignorant blind can honestly claim that OJ is innocent. If dershowitz needs to clean his concience he should talk to a rabbi.      .......socks  
 I've heard many of the term before. Zoomburb. Big Box. Alligator. I guess that's what happens when you grow up in the house of an engineer. I figured this illustrated guide would be interesting to look at, so I picked it up. The pictures were only satisfactory, and some of the writing was above my head. I did learn lots of new terms though. However, I don't think I would recommend this unless you have some interest in land-use, urban planning, or architecture 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I found this book to be rather dull although I did learn a lot about fox hunting. The description was fabulous but I don't think that it was much of a mystery. I kept reading but I also kept wondering when something was actually going to happen. I did love the character of "Sister" 
 Is "Ladykillers" a buddy-caper movie? Is it a religious metaphor? Is it a quirky comedy with supernatural overtones? Is it "Reservoir Dogs"? Is it a star-making turn about an unforgettable character?  It apparently tries to be all these things.   What it ACTUALLY is is an unfunny, schizophrenic, mean-spirited mess.   The movie starts out with great promise. Tom Hanks stars as what appears to be a somewhat-pompous, Edgar Allan Poe-quoting, Colonel Sanders vest-wearing, over-educated, genteel Southern professor of Renaissance music. What he actually is is a (still-likable) con-man and swindler. At least, that's what he starts out as at the beginning of the film. His dialogue is supurb, his accent and portrayal spot-on.   He decides he wants to rob a casino. In order to do this he devises a scheme to tunnel into the casino's counting room from underground. To fascilitate his plan, he lets a room in an old woman's house close to the casino, and convinces his landlady that he actually needs her basement to practice with his band of musicians. He cobbles together an unlikely assemblage of partners in crime, which include a Chinese general who has a Hitler complex (he even has a Hitler mustache), a strange jack-of-all-trades and explosives expert who can't stop farting, a stupid football player to do the digging, and Marlon Wayans, who plays the beyond-stereotypical black thug who loves rap music and constantly threatens to shoot people with his gun while yelling expletives. The Chinese general has a total dialogue of four words the entire movie (I'm not kidding, I counted!) and the football player about 12. What the point of those two characters was I'm not really sure.  Now, you'd think that with such a motley crew, there would be slapstick humor galore. Well, nope. There are "incidents" which often revolve around farting, one scene where a guy blows his finger off with explosives (I THINK that was supposed to be funny---it's tough to tell) and a lot of scenes with Mr Wayans saying "F-this" and "F-that" while waving his gun around.   Still, for the first 75% of the movie, I was still fascinated--simply because Tom Hanks' character is so unique and so memorable. His genteel humor and dialogue (which seems to come directly out of PhD theses on esoteric medieval literature, Rococo music theory and Edgar Allan Poe) and his portrayal of such is fascinating. Unfortunately, even that is not enough to carry the movie, as it loses focus and becomes mean-spirited about 3/4 though the movie.  After what appears to be an attempt at a quirky buddy-caper flick, about 3/4 through the robbers decide that it is necessary to kill their landlady. They are very serious about this. Suddenly things aren't funny anymore. Marlon Wayans' character gets killed in a struggle with the farting explosives expert after he attempts to kill the landlady. This is not funny. He is not killed in a funny way--- and why is there suddenly killing anyway, when the tone of the movie up to that point had been slapstick humor? They dump his body off a bridge onto a garbage barge going down the river. Not long afterwards, the Chinese general kills the explosives expert by choking him graphically with piano wire while he is farting. Apparently this is also supposed to be funny --- but is actually extremely not funny. It is sick and disturbing. They dump his body off the bridge onto a garbage barge going down a river. Soon after the Chinese general tries to kill the landlady and kills himself by accidentally falling down the stairs. Body to garbage barge. Tom Hanks tries to convince the football player to kill the landlady. He refuses, but accidentally shoots himself in the face with the gun while on the bridge. His body falls of it's own volition onto the garbage barge. This is extremely graphic, violent and not funny. Finally, a head of a gargoyle falls off the bridge and hits Tom Hanks on the head, and his body falls into the garbarge barge, too. Everyone's dead. The landlady keeps the money.   What's the point?  If it wasn't for the quirky performance Tom Hanks gave, this would have been a one-star for me.   Avoid it unless you're stuck on an airplane or are a big Tom Hanks fan. 
 I thought reading this book was a waste of time. It largely preoccupied with its overdone sex-and-gender research and sometimes becomes downright obscure eg. when the writer of the first chapter was just interested in the way certain "scripts" he believes to exist can be or not be found in the dating stories of some boys he interviewed. What's sad about this chapter is that he ignores the obvious dilemmas some of them were in. One told him that he wanted to try out anal intercourse in a public restroom in order to "find his identity" or something. The author does not comment on this glaring misconception of what sexual orientation is and is not about (eg your personal identity) and how anal intercourse or other sex techniques might be wrongly linked with same-sex attraction or a contrived "gay identity". Anyone interested in this particular problem should read the papers and essays of Chuck Tarver and Billy Weintraub (both are available on-line)!  In another chapter its writer concludes that some gay men actually think they basically don't differ from straight men just because of their difference in sexual orientation. Now that's something that should be emphasised, but the whole collection of essays seems to be rather about how gay men are somehow special or different while straight men are all the good old emotionless blokes.  Another funny thing was when in a chapter its writer complained that there are some gay men who object to a link of feminism and the gay rights movement or try to prove they are not chauvinistic when she thinks they obviously are. I thought that made the whole intentions of her article clear.  The only good chapter was the last one: its author researched drag queens and concludes that the gay men who do that kind of cross-dressing don't do it to actually become a woman, but just as straight men might try to make fun of certain feminine role-models. That was an interesting read.  Still, the only book I can wholeheartedly recommend on this subject is Bawer's A Place at the Table 
 The feature that originally sold me on the DSM-320 was its support for the XviD and DivX formats.  These, however, are the two formats that are supported the least, and a slow, jerky, framerate should be expected.  I at first thought it was a bandwidth issue, and proceeded to hard wire it to my computer using a crossover cable, the framerate improved, but not enough, in my opinion, for this device to even claim support for these file types.  If support for these two formats are the selling feature for you, be warned, you should look elsewhere 
 im usually a big fan of catherine coulters books but this book just left me speechless and disgusted. beyond what the character had to handle from the so-called hero, the rape scene just was inexcusable. i didnt and dont understand what went through coulters head when she decided to put such a brutal and descriptive gang rape--it left me nauseous and disturbed.  i was, and am, incredibly disappointed in coulter for this book. honestly when i first read the scene i was waiting for the hero to come to the rescue because it was truly too unbelievably vile. i shudder that coulter made use of such a terrible topic in her novel, something that shouldnt be talked about to sell books. 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 The only reason why I watch this video is because Hunk model Tony Ward stars in it.  Tony Ward is that dreamy hunk that came out in Madonna's controversial Justify My Love video.  Since then I have not been able to get studly Tony Ward out of my mind.  He is the only reason for watching this film.  Other than that the film is not worth anything, unless you are really into all that street Hustling of Hollywood.  I warn you that this film is not very good.  Direction is bad, picture isn't that good, low budget, mediocre plot, and Extremely explicit sexual scenes are characteristics of this film.  The only saving grace of the film is the hunkster Tony Ward.  If you want Tony, then this is a good film to see all of him.  Otherwise, discard the rest of the film.  This film is really not suitable for people of any age 
 I tried to read this book(translated) to the portuguese, about 15 years ago.Even never finishing it, I as a brazilian (unemployed) agronomist must tell the reality about weberianism. At first, Max Weber was a man looking to show the reality.He wasn't a bigot(or mad) such as Loraine Boettner, Eric Jon Phelps, etc. With no doubt, Max Weber was a great scholar, a man with great IQ, a man man looking for reality.Even with this qualities, Max weber was wrong.Even a man like Max Weber, like you and me, is ever a prisioner of his times, informations and reality. The core idea of this book is that capitalism, industrial revolution and modern science were made by protestantism. Very believed idea in Weber's times. In fact, Weber puts "the cart ahead of the horse", in this idea.In fact, modern world wasn't created after Luther.It was shaped in XV Century, with the press and Great Navigations. The press was invented by a catholic german, called Johann Gutemberg.All the great navigators were catholic men.Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Bartolomeu Dias,Cabral, Gil Eanes,etc. 100% of then were catholics and were under catholic kings money and orders.With the Great discoveries the American continent was under Europe's hands.The claim that protestantism was the source of Europe's power was and is a fraud. In fact economically and lively, after Luther, protestant Germany became a nightmare until the end of 30 years War, in 1648.The claim that protestantism was good for Europe is a possibility, not a fact. In fact, we could see protestantism is a result of nacionalism, church's abuses, education and greed for church's money. Not all protestants countries of Europe had good economical results.Germany was doomed after Luther's Reformations.Not all catholic countries had bad economic results, as France shows.Spain and Portugal were bad, after jew's expeling, not after any reformation. With the Industrial Revolution, coal became condition "sine qua non" for economical sucess.And the Geology(not theology)decided the future for nations in Europe.With no coal Portugal, Spain, Italy were senteced to relatively poverty, in Europe.France with bad coal reserves, has some dificults in industrialization.Belgium, even more than 90% of his population in catholic church, had no economical problems, because Belgium had great coal's mines. Why England had so good economic results, ahead of every other european country?Beeing an island, England shouldn't have an expensive army against invasions.Then, England could built the biggest navy in the world.Geography, not theology gave economic sucess to England in XVI and XVII Century.With the Industrial Revolution, England had coal reserves looking to be minerated. Geography and later geology gave England industrial and economical sucess.With the 30 years War, Germany was splited in about 300 feufdoms. The England's decadency also came from no theological problemas, but geological, political and tecnological problems.With the reunification of Germany, an industrial enemy was created in continental Europe.With the invention of airplane, England could be attacked by an enemy with no navy.With the coming of oil's age, England (North Sea oil's reserves not found before the 1960's) had to import100% of his fuel.With both World wars, England's empire was sentenced to death. Protestantism in fact, like today, was ever divided in thounsands of cults, since his beginnings.If fact all kinds of protestantisms are image and similarity of his human creator, culture and society.Luther made a anti-semithic protestantism suc as himself.Calvin made a bank's friend protestantism, as himself was.And the England's king Henry VIII made an english protestantism.All reformator made a Jesus equal to himself.This fact is true until today.Protestantism don't make a society and culture.In fact a society and a culture makes a protestantism. The brazilian and latin american reality shows that protestantism itself don't make economical sucess.Here in Brazil, 80% of people who go to a church, go to a protestant (pentecostal) church.Do we have economical sucess with all this protestantism? NO!!!! This same fact happened in many parts of latin America.Bad economic results followed protestantism growing.El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua all are as protestants(pentecostals) as Brazil.All with bad economical results. About 35% of brazilian population are protestants, against about 80% of brazilian maids are protestants.In fact the brazilian protestants are, poorer than the general brazilian population.Also brazilian states with more protestants have bigger crime rates.In fact, more protestants, more crimes in Brazil.The poorest of all religious groups in Brazil are, the protestants(pentecostal).Only protestantism as a medicine for economical, political and cultural troubles is a quackery. Not a single african or latin american country had good economical results after protestantism's growing.At the same time, Spain with less than 1% of his population protestant, is an economical sucess.Italy and Portugal with only about 2% of protestants are also developed countries.  This book is a source with some good things to read.As I wrote up, Max Weber was an honest scholar, not a mad or a bigot.After all, Max Weber was looking to show us the reality, but he only wrote us rooted, in his own times, believes and realities.Every man is a prisioner of his times, friends and realities.And Max Weber wasn't an exception.          
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 I ordered this for Christmas from a Marketplace Seller. It was defective and assumed I would have to deal directly with Philips to get a replacement. After seven weeks, I still do not have a replacement from them; their customer service people keep telling me 10-15 days, and I have no recourse. I also thought the unit was complicated to use and would gladly obtain a refund if I could, or even get the unit. I would not recommend buying this or any other Philips product to anyone. Their customer service is the worst I've ever dealt with. I also had to pay the shipping to return their defective DVD player 
 As a reader a few "light" histories of the era, I have a passing familiarity with the chronology, personalities, and issues of the time. None of this prepared me for the obscurity of Professor Schwartz's book.  It reads like a doctoral thesis; short on description, long on concrete assertions and refutations of such.  It's hard to read and hard to appreciate unless you are a REAL student of the time and are throughly familiar with the subject matter.  I was so disappointed with how dense this book is that I'm stunned that it's being recommended for the casually interested history reader 
 (FOR SOME REASON THIS REVIEW SHOWS ONE STAR--THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT MY OPINION OF BURTT'S BOOK. I DON'T KNOW HIS BOOK WELL ENOUGH TO RATE IT, BUT LIKE WHAT I DO KNOW OF IT.) I want to add a brief note to Bob Meyer's excellent and comprehensive review. In his important but apparently almost entirely neglected "Husserl's phenomenology and the foundations of natural science" (Ohio University Press, 1989), Charles W. Harvey draws extensively on Burtt's work. It seems that the philosopher Edmund Husserl developed in great detail the kind of view and critique Burtt later offered of the noxious consequences of the mathematization of human experience, the bifurcation into the mind(experience)-world dichotomy. (Husserl was Heidegger's principal teacher, and I recently have come to believe that Heidegger's famous critique of rational-technological thinking ["Enframing", "Gestell"] is little more than a pretentious rehash of his teacher's thought.) I highly recommend reading at least the first few chapters of Harvey's book as an enrichment of Burtt 
 This is a very old book ( 1972 ? ) and have no much more that a hundred pages. Have only a little utility for teorical learning about old clocks. Today is practicaly useless.  Este libro trata el tema de arreglar viejos relojes antiguos, aquellos de pared o repisa de forma muy superficial. Cuando se empieza a poner interesante se acaba el libro 
 I own a strategy guide for every Final Fantasy game, and this one was sorely disappointing.  I think the only guide that has been worse than this is the FF9 'PlayOnline' joke (that no longer exists online).  The strategy guide leaves out several key elements of the game (such as how to find Aeris' limit break BEFORE disc 2), how you can reach certain areas, where to find items, who to have in your party in certain areas, etc.  The information was blatantly inaccurate or extremely confusing.  Some of the maps are mislabeled and look more like a random assortment of screenshots than a coherent guide.  All in all, don't waste your money on this guide.  You're better off buying the Brady version instead 
 I picked up this movie mistakingly thinking it was another story about a MidWestern couple who had a story similar to this.  The man, as it were, suffered a trama and discovered he had multiple personality disorder.  This was, of course, not the same thing.  I just don't get this movie.  I don't get how someone could be this self centered as to put their family through something like this.  The guy waits until age 50 something to confess that he's really a woman trapped in a man's body, confesses it to their minister rather than his wife first, and then expects the world to accept him.  Somehow I doubt a town full of guys named Billy Bob would understand, least of all anyone in or outside my family.  The guy should've seen a shrink, but then again had he seen a shrink there wouldn't have been a movie to watch.  
 I bought this drive primarily to keep on my keychain and because the cap wrapped around the body and I would not have to worry abut loosing caps.  This worked well for about 2 months when, after the normal wear and tear of taking my keys out of my pocket, the cap popped at the point that conects to the key ring. I say popped not broke because the cap is made out of rubber-like material that I now realise is a glorified rubber band. Sport indeed.   I had to resort to keeping the drive loose in my pockets, have long since lost the fragile thing, and am now wishing I had the frustration of loosing caps for a drive that is sucurely attached to my key ring 
 We loved Murphy's "Henry the Fourth", but we didn't particularly like this book.  While the artwork is delightful, the rhymes are clumsy, and worse, the premise just is not very interesting.  At least, finding out what happened to the cow's utter-mittens did not engage my kids (almost 3 and 5).    On the plus side, the book did give my almost 5 y.o. and myself a place to start talking about even and odd.  And the way that the artist showed the pairs of mittens and the missing mitten in outline made it easy to point out what the story was taking about.    But I'd give this book a pass unless you are desparate to find an edutainment introduction to even/odd numbers 
 I don't know, but this book was not very useful to me 
 I bought two of these and within 3 days of each other they both stopped putting out any moisture. What a waste of my time and effort 
 Maybe i'm not as cultured as some of the people who rated this book, but i have read the likes of Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott and i think it is safe for this to be a true review. Please, please don't put yourself through the torment of reading this book, it is probably the worst book i have ever read. It goes on and on about the littlest of details which don't have anything to do with the book. I read this when i was 11 and it is safe to say i wasn't too immature to read it. Everyone in my class read it and i'm pretty sure we all had the same opinions, it really sucked. I would tell you the worst part of the book, but that would ruin the story. But let me just tell you a little tip, don't read it. Don't read it, don't read it, don't read it. I tried to read it again last year and i couldn't put myself through the pain and torment of reading the worlds worst book. Don't waste your money or waste a part of your life reading a book about nothing 
 Don't get carried away by the title. At first glance you'd expect a huge tutorial on Flash 5, when in fact its just a thousand plus pages of content I could have found on the help section of Flash 5 itself. I expected this book to be project-based training, when I got surprised that it spent the first few hundred pages on exploring the interface alone. The authors just spent too much time EXPLAINING stuff and not too much time teaching readers HOW to use Flash. It doesnt encourage use of Flash, it doesnt inspire, nor does it merit a second look. My recommendation: If you're a Flash newbie and didnt know a help section existed, buy this book. As for the rest go look somewhere else. (e.g. Foundation Flash 5) 
 I was thrilled by the first season's creative and compelling representation of characters.  The opening titles, music, dramatizations, editing, as well as, subtle humor of the first season, was an artful and poignant display of life to which many people, regardless of sexual orientation, could relate.  I was immediately disappointed by the second season, however, as it quickly dissolved a great work of art and turned it into cheap pulp.   I hope that the third and fourth season doesn't make the same mistake.  
 Maybe the author wrote this book as part of his therapy.  It could have been such a nice book.    To read about something as idiotic as putting a small dog and a weasel into a barrel and closing the lid until one killed the other is just too much.  The dog is the one left alive, but has been hurt so badly they have to shoot it in the head.  Then there is the pig mating scene.  Yes, we all know "it" happens, but my child does not need to read about "thrusting" and blood running down the gilt's leg.  The boar owner makes a comment that the next time the gilt will stand still for it.  Great message for young girls.  When I asked children what they remember about the book, they tell me the above stories.  One did not even remember the boy's father dies, but remembered the above graphic situations.  Much is lost on them.    The graphic situations ruined what could have been a good book 
 I heard the song "Leave the Pieces" on the radio this morning, so I bought the CD since I liked the song. Other than that one song, I am very dissapointed in the very poor singing abilities of the two singers: their voices are infantile and immature, and the song material is insipid and puerile. This CD will appeal to thirteen-year-old girls, but I doubt an adult will find it worth the cost. A few of the songs are so bad that one might be compelled to believe they were made that way on purpose, as a parody of what can only be call reaking garbage.  This is not Country music, which was another dissapointment. At best it can be called "pop."  I very much recomend that people listen to the CD before they pay for it 
 As a former student of Ms. Morris, I will state that she and William Morris were quite emphatic about keeping the teachings sacred and authentic as taught by Grand Master Takata. Her history is to this day accurate 
 A great portion of the book is very boring. I really felt like rushing through the book. I don't recommend this book to other 
 The only reason I forced myself to plow through this book to the end (after having started it for the second time), was because of the glowing reviews, and because I had bought it and didn't want to waste my money. With the exception of a few clever phrases, it lacks all of the qualities which make for a good novel: character development, continuity, tension, plot. The overuse of acronyms is disruptive, and the typeface is difficult to read. The best thing about this book is that it's blessedly short 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 Berenstain bear books are usually great reads, with a good lesson within the fun and enjoyable text.  This story had a good message, but wasn't a fun book to read.  I lost attention, and attentiveness.  My voice as i read it became slowly more monotone.  If you want a strickly educational book, its better to read them the dictionary 
 First off: I'd like it better if we had 1/2-star options. Judas Unchained really doesn't deserve a 2, more a 2-1/2 or 2-3/4.  I have a love/hate relationship with Peter Hamilton's books. He's very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster-than-light society plausible but, as with a lot of these hard-science, libertarian SF authors, he badly needs an editor. I was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel, Pandora's Star. He also has far too many "main characters" who (despite 800+ pages) never seem to come alive. They all speak with essentially the same voice. And when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped '60s era hippies -- come on, does anyone seriously say "dude" in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century?  And why is Hamilton so obsessed with sex with young (or rejuvenated) women?  Hamilton's treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best. On the one hand, the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed, represented and believable. On the other hand, the dynamics of the relationship between "old timers" and "first lifers" is unsatisfactory. In four centuries, for example, NO ONE has even attempted to unseat Nigel Sheldon from his position as head of the Sheldon dynasty? Perhaps the Commonwealth's continual expansion is the safety valve but even here, the government (controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties) controls it. Another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life didn't change -- I mean the characters of a novel (almost by definition) are dynamic, go-get-'em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die. Why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime?  The aliens are OK. The problem with them (and this is true of nearly every SF story) is that they tend to be one dimensional -- they're all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up. (This is a problem in fantasy stories, too.) On the plus side, I do tip my hat to Hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien "deus ex machina." Ozzie's adventures in "Wonderland" (i.e., the silfen paths) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the Dyson barriers but the knowledge doesn't really help anyone defeat the Primes.  Overall, if you started with Pandora's Star, you probably should finish the journey with Judas Unchained. If you haven't started down this "silfen path," I recommend Alistair Reynolds, Tony Daniel or Iain Banks. They write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than Hamilton has proven himself to be to date 
 This story was about a young brother trying to make it in life. I have to admit that I was excited to read this book, and it let me down.  I didn't like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him.  I don't think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a "Do Right Man" at all, but rather a wimp.  During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did.  From there on the whole story was slow. I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job.   This was a slow read for me, I skipped a few chapters just so I could find out what finally happened in the end 
 Don't watch Click if you're in the mood for a light-hearted comedy.  The middle of the film is miserable.  Of course, it has a Hollywood happy ending.  The comedy bits are OK but few and far between.  If Click had been marketed as a drama, this would be less of a problem.   The story line has some great life lessons.  Without giving away too much, the morals of this movie are: 1.  put family first; 2. don't wish your life away, but enjoy every minute of it, even the mundane.  For driving home those lessons, Click has some value.  It is also great to see Adam Sandler do well in a dramatic role.  He has more range than you might imagine.    But there's something very unsatisfying about watching Click that's not fixed by the sugar-coated ending or the few bits of Sandler-esque pranks and smartass jokes. In short, it's a mediocre film 
 The remote worked only for 2 days. My daughter loves the look of it so I am not able to dispose it off. Its a total waste of money. I wish I had read the reviews before buying it since lot of people seem to have the same problem with the remote. 
 I couldn't really finish this book, although it was interesting as history of religion it was pretty dry 
 I watched it on big screens (57 and 106 inches) and whenever there is fast movement or the camera moves, the dancers are not sharp. I even wrote OpusArte about it, but was informed they don't see any problems with it.  The performance itself is outstanding, but the DVD is visually poorly produced 
 I loathed this book. I despised it. While every eighth grade English teacher in the U.S. may hate that I say this, I'm only telling the truth. There are characters that are so cocky and reading about them made me want to gag. Tom Sawyer as a boy and as a character seemed both annoying as a real human, and unrealistic. Becky, too, was unbelievable. No young children such as those could possibly act like that, and besides, I don't truly believe a boy Tom's age would be so cool in a cave, and rescue his lady-love.  Tom Sawyer and I just didn't get along. It's just one of those things. I suffered through reading it, though perhaps someday I'll try again, and the experience will be better 
 Much of the coverage is incomplete and misleading.  Souder, in his 1984 work entitled Project Selection and Economic Analysis provides a much more useful, cogent and useable account of selecting and rating projects; if ROI is to be used as the key selection tool!  The book touts the benefits of Critical Chain with zeal; but with limited if any defensible evidence.  For those new to professional project management, the book provides much cheerleading but little value related to delivery of projects within the context of a viable well managed, competitive business environment.  The book's reference list is anemic.  Assessment of the broad scope and depth of information related to PMOs and Portfolio Management is questionable.  While somewhat dated, PACE by McGrath and Portfolio Management by Kleinschmidt et.al. provide far more definitive, proven, actionable, and valuable insight and direction 
 I just want to associate myself with the review by S. Berner. I couldn't believe how boring the whole thing was 
 I bought this disc with the understanding that one of my favorite ELO songs Roll Over Beethoven.  Don't waste your money, the version is edited much to my suprise!  Was this done purposely? Why put an edited version of a great song?  There's plenty of room on the CD for the full unedited version.  I wish I could get my money back, whoever decided to put the edited version in should send me $11.98 
 This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts.  Although Lewis is a witty, scrutinizing, insightful, and overall entertaining writer, I think this book is highly overpriced. Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it, when LBOs were a la mode, Donald Trump was making headlines, and Japan was considered a threat to the US economy and welfare...crazy thought.  Go for Liar's Poker if you want to read Michael Lewis, that script is a jewel 
 I found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written, but also insidiously demeaning to women. Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes. My fiancee and I have read Chapman's Five Love Languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise 
 Hi,   I have not receive my item yat.  Thanks 
 This book was boring, filled with too much English 101 inside this book instead of how to break it into the technical writing fields. I could have used a old college English instea 
 While few can sincerely argue against the assertion that in many ways the American educational system is in crisis and that serious scholarship must be devoted to righting the wrongs in this system, the 2004 Brookings Papers do very little in the way of concrete and viable options to fix these wrongs in the system and instead offer much in the way of obvious conclusions, such as that good teachers help students to learn more (I'm not kidding, folks). Serious discussion of options like charter schools, reform of the way teachers are certified, and voucher programs is bypassed in favor of rhetoric about improving the system without any concrete ideas of how to go about it. Another thing that I found disconcerting about the work is the way in which much focus is placed on improving the education of socioeconomically disadvantaged students, while ignoring the needs of any other type of student. On the whole, this collection was uninformative and painful to read and I would advise anyone with a choice in the matter to avoid it at all costs.  
 Buying this CD was the biggest waste of my money so far in 2007. I'm throwing it in the garbage because it is such a bad CD.  I guess if you are looking for a CD of noises instead of music, then it's for you.   Where is the music???   It's actually very creepy and I guess it would be good for Halloween or for background audio for a horror movie. Don't waste your money 
 Sorry to say but the recipies in this book are yukky!  I don't know what Mollie was thinking, she however is not the good cook people think she is. You will be much better off sticking with the Moosewood cookbooks...every single one is truly wonderful.  And the other reviewer was right, what's so special about the title recipie...nothing.  Don't waste your money, I threw my copy out 
 Although a cd teaching Catalan is great, it really needs to have the guide in order to use it properly. This is not clear in the description 
 Author doesn't have anything in this book which not already available free of cost on the internet.  It was a total waste of my time and money procuring and reading this book.  May be useful to people who can't search items on their own online. Admire the market who knew how to title useless books like these! 
 The photos are beautiful, the designs are just wonderful...but if you have kids this is not real life. This is a magazine lifestyle. You could only do this if you had an unlimited budget, there are no true solutions for real families with real children and real budgets. Sure my home could be organized if I had an open checkbook and could have such fabulous built-ins, and all the baskets I could buy! Stick with the real simple magazine and leave the book for the coffee table. 
 This was a gorgeous show, but kind of conservative -- made Richter into the new "master" of painting, sidelines all his weirder and more "conceptual" work. And why does Robert Storr have to try so hard to put himself at the center of everything?? I saw the Richter show in SF around 1990, so no, this is NOT "the frist American retrospective." And Storr's dismissive (and often really uninformed) treatment of other critics (especially German critic Benjamin Buchloh, who's written on Richter for like, decades) shows what a limited writer and scholar Storr really is. But for better or worse, the pictures are great, and a lot of the other material is really good 
 This is just a REALLY bad book.  First I blame James Patterson, but I really REALLY blame his editor.  What editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published?    The villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains.  Just - over the top. The plot line is unbelievable.  Aside from Alex Cross and the two villains, nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever.  Alex Cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the FBI to foil the villains.  This is supposed to be one of those "the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world" type thriller but - there's no sense of urgency, and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched, and inept (but not deliberately written that way).  I could go on and on but it's not worth the words.  This book is REALLY a waste of time.  I can't believe anybody published it 
 Not the best toy I own.  I wanted to send it back after a week because the letter C wouldn't say it's name.  After a while it started working, but then D stopped.  According to the online demo the balls will say their colors when dropped in the chute.  Mine never have done this. My son likes this product and uses it.  As a parent I am disappointed in the quality 
 When Robert De Niro is on, he's on!  When he jumps into character, he lives the part without looking back.  That's what makes De Niro such a great actor.  He usually takes his work very seriously (Bullwinkle would be one of the exceptions)and makes us believe, good or bad, in what he's doing.  When he plays Gil Renard, divorced hunting knife salesman, avid Rolling Stones fan and SF Giants' Baseball freak, the message is a little muddled.  The Giants have picked up baseball superstar Bobby Raybun (Snipes) for some outrageous amount of money (Sound familiar?) and Gil is tickled pink.  Rayburn is going to put the Giants on top and win them a World Series title.  Well...things don't always work out that way.  Rayburn doesn't get his lucky number 11.  He screws up his ribs.  The pressure of his huge contract is weighing him dow because the fans expect results and they're not afraid to tell him that at each game.  Can we all say SLUMP! Gil, on the other hand, is having troubles of his own.  His job is moving on without him.  His relationship with his son is a strained and creepy mess of custody battle proportions.  His ex-wife has put a restraining order on him.  And Bobby Rayburn, the 40 Million Dollar Kid,  sucks! Focusing not on the other things in his life that need fixing, baeball needs Gil's full, obssessive attention.  He needs to help Rayburn out of his slump, right?  Well....what if he kills off the outfielder who refused to give up the number 11?  Things deteriorate from there as Renard's madness take over.  A mixed, creepy movie.  I could not feel any pity for De Niro's charcter & he needed that to be truly effective.  Otherwise, he just comes off as some looney assh*le baseball freak who blames his own problems on the game.  The storylne is loose and clumsy.  The characters are middle of the road.  Somewhere along the line, De Niro picks parts that make no sense.  When he plays the bad guy or the psycho, he's pretty effective, but here the performance is mired in bad writing.  I couldn't wait for Gil Renard to die and that's not a good thing, even though I knew it was going to happen.  Very predictable. Not one of De Niro's better outings.  Snipes was decent as was Benicio Del Toro.  Like Cape Fear, not a De Niro flick I'd want to watch again for a long, long while.  Deal with it 
 I've officially decided to stop ordering boxed sets from Amazon, as  it more often than not results in the frustration and inconvenience of having to return/replace defective DVDs.  In this case, 2 of the 5 DVDs were defective (Mr Skeffington & Now Voyager).  I reviewed the other three films individually (all excellent and worth owning), but I cannot recommend boxed collections of this sort, purchased here 
 I received this swing as a gift. I really liked that it was more of a cradle swing, that the tray was removable(in fact I never even put it on and it was great), and the fact that it swings side to side, like a crade, or front and back, like a normal swing.  My baby loved it, the music, the mobile, etc.  In the early months, it was the only place that she would sleep without me, so I loved the few moments of sanity that it gave me.  What I didn't like about it was #1, it uses a zillion batteries if you use the mobile regularly, and #2 the speed control was pretty stupid, I thought since all the speeds were the same, no matter which setting you have the swing on.  But if you can live with these complaints then this is an awesome swing 
 For all you guys that know Sublime, you also know this CD was put out to cash on Sublime's short and sudden success after Bradley Nowell's death. Bradley was the heart and soul of Sublime and without him they could not go on, so they released this CD of unreleased songs and remixes. Some songs are good, and others mediocre. Bradley Nowell never performed a bad song, so either way this CD is still worth your money. I would reccomend buying 40 Oz. and Bradley Nowell Acoustic. If you have those already, then buy the self titled CD (Which was largely over-rated)... Second Hand Smoke should be last on your list of Sublime CD's to get... Only get it if you are a huge fan 
 This book really has nothing to do with what Santeria is really about.  Mostly it is English translations of spells written in Spanish booklets available in Botanicas.  If you want to learn about Santeria, skip this book 
 They say they sent it to my address, but i never recieved it.  I called them.  they told me they sent it, and did not offer further help 
 This was one of the two worst books I've ever read in my life.  I had hoped it might be like "Foucault's Pendulum" by Umberto Eco (a book I like), as some friend suggested.  But it bore no similarity at all, except in being dense, long, and somewhat difficult to follow.    I found "Infinite Jest" to be plotless, self-absorbed, and wallowing in pointless cruelty and hideousness.  It gave me a clear image of the author as being arrogant and self-congratulatory, and completely lacking in any kind of moral or ethical center.  Life is just too short to waste on stuff like this.  I only wish I could get back the time I spent reading this horrible book.  I stuck with it all the way to the end hoping for some sort of payoff, something that would tie it all up and make the experience worth it, but there was nothing.  It just ended. 
 If Carlson *truly* believed that Secret Mark was a modern forgery, he would simply track down the manuscript and carbon-date the parchment/ink.  However, since he knows it's genuine, (but doesn't fit with his version of Christianity) his only option is embarrass himself with his feeble arguments about how Morton Smith "forged" it: Clement is TOO much like Clement. The Morton Salt theory (hilarious). Etc.  Bottom Line: Don't waste your time or your money 
 This is maybe a 4 Star book - IF, and ONLY if, this is the first book on Jack Welch and GE you have picked up.  If you have already read "Jack" skip it.  There is nothing here that hasn't already been said elsewhere. I was disappointed how little "new" information was presented in this book.  If you are looking for something on the topic of controlling your own destiny this title is somewhat misleading.     
 It's quite hilarious, what people will believe.  I do not see why people contradict the DNA evidence and the fact that Anna Anderson didn't look at all like the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna.  It's quite pathetic, this woman, a psychopath who grew into her role as the "lost grand duchess".  There needs to be a better memoriam to the girl, not the crazy woman who said she was she.  It's absolutely laughable, all the things he says in this book.  It reads more like a tabloid, what with a secret fifth daughter and all this other junk 
 If you want a review of the plot itself, complete with spoilers, feel free to read the other reviews.   My biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed, again and again, due to the fact that the script writers and director couldn't keep the story straight.   There is a homage to Asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm. That would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film. There are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible.  That said, it was a bit enjoyable. The cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given. If the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked, maybe I would have cared what happened to them.  The dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say, "Oooh, cool".  Good premise, good effects, good acting, but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film 
 I can't figure out why the editors and publishers of this volume are claiming it to be a celebration of a new art form. Brief creative nonfiction? Hardly. Some of the pieces here could be called creative, but absolutely none of them are nonfiction. Nonfiction is the study of issues or phenomena with evidence and analysis. Here we have a collection of what everyone else in the world calls memoirs, and which have been easily found for decades in magazines and newspapers. While such works can be a relaxing and non-stressful read when you come across them, in a compilation such as this book they are repetitive and mind-numbing. I count 91 submissions in this book, and every single one can be categorized as a simple memoir, especially since almost all of them have "I" or "me" or "our" in the opening sentence. Very few stand out from the crowd in any way. Incongruous winners include Richard Rodriguez's disturbing meditations on the struggles of Mexican migrant laborers, David James Duncan's piece about witnessing an accidental death, Michael Shay's thoughts about giving his son Ritalin, and six or seven pretty good pieces on the various horrors of war. But otherwise, the book inflicts upon us a never-ending parade of quaint musings and meditations, attempted deep thoughts on minor matters of human interest, and several dozen interchangeable Thoreau-like nature reflections. Memoir writing has its own strengths and usefulness, but this lightweight and sluggish book is not the groundbreaker it thinks it is. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 This was another Pinker book I couldn't finish. If he was a taxi-driver he would take you from Brooklyn to New York via San Francisco. Sometimes even his asides have asides! Perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word 
 Somehow I felt that if the subject matter was going to be so horrible, then we must expect to be uplifted and guided as we read this child's story from heaven.  Not so.  She never seems happy in heaven, nor do the other souls around her.  She doesn't even seem content.  Chapter after chapter one keeps expecting something....anything to give this childs life worth.  To give the book some worth.  Never happens.  Very disappointed 
 having heard of a prequel for jackson's film(a different interpretation from merrian cooper's version) i was convinced that the author would have ample opportunity to write a new adventure story with familiar concepts, possibly rich enough in detail and excitement to stand on it's own. seeing the great respect jackson's team had for the original, my expectations seemed logical at the time. what i found was pointless elaborations about life in 1932 new york, stretched for more than a third of the book, the tribulations of carl denham and jack driscoll equally stretched and the action and history of skull island reduced to an afterthought. i was disappointed with kong not making an apperance(we all know who he is, so if, as a previous reviewr has mentioned, the author was restricted in scope by the studios, such a decision is evidently a negative factor) as well as not developing the potential of the paleontologist that discovered skull island but was supressed by the authorities, and so on.  for a truely wonderful prequel read kong: king of skull island by joe devito and brad strickland 
 Am I the only one who has recognized the cover similarities between this book and another about codes? I'm certain that these two very proficient marketers didn't randomly select the title or cover layout. Maybe Dan Brown, the author of the most successful adult fiction of all time, should have his publisher look into this "coincidence". And by the way, I'm not a DaVinci Code fan. Like all other entrepreneur and self-help book authors, Hansen and Allen figured out years ago that all you have to do is repackage the same ideas. They were more clever than most by branding with Brown's blockbuster. Glad I saved $2,000 and three days of my life on their seminar. 
 This is the most pointless show ever. Seeing baby's fart and dogs biting crotches and people degrading themselves by making themselves look like complete dumbasses is funny? Have the brains of America been THIS simplified? This is a show that belongs on MTV- it has all of the traits an MTV show has: it's pointless, it's pointless, umm... It's pointless... And, well, it's pointless! If you wan t a show with humor (not to steal anything from Danny), watch the Simpson- the funniest show ever along with Family Guy. Why would anyone want to watch a show about people acting like complete idiots? MTV Rocks, maybe. 
 Title says it all.  I enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series.  Forth book sort of dragged.  By the middle of this book I had to make a decision...keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel.  Let's face it, life's too short.  If you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of "The Stand".  I'm afraid this doesn't do it.    Think about it another way do you want to read over 5000 pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers?  Cheer 
 This book fails to present any interesting story or perspective on the topic within.  Lew expresses a distrust and dislike for ASL and Deaf Culture that permeates his work and it's simply unacceptable 
 I too would give this "0" stars, both for the quality of the product and the non existent customer service.  From the start this product hasn't worked right, and it's getting worse.  The remote never worked, and GE refused to replace even though I had reciept.  The radio reception is terrible, with a whooshing sound on a couple of channels, we only get about 3 or 4 stations.  Now, the plastic "skin" over the tuning and volume buttons has totally worn away, making the unit look terrible.  The only thing that works well is the clock! I had also read on this site that the cord is the antenna, so in the hopes of getting better reception the cord is hanging down onto the counter.  What a piece of junk! 
 While this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature, I do have some critical comments to make. Firstly, it is apparent that the author's own holocaust experiences (or more specifically, those of his family) have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented. Secondly, there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get, in my opinion, a few pieces of interesting material. Finally, the underlying theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened, or would not have been so sever, is (again in my opinion) flawed. As the book shows, IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews, it would not have been impossible without IBM.  Having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading 
 This was THE item my eight year old wanted for Christmas. We searched high and low finally paying too much for the product. While it looks cool, the RV doesn't hold together very well. The balls that dissolve and turn into aliens are a one-time deal and most of the rest of the set hasn't been played with since Christmas.   The action figures get more play than the RV and everything connected with. My advice is to save the money and pick up a couple of the action figures because your kids will get far more fun and use out those than this set.  It really was cool in theory but rarely gets played with. 
 I look for games to play at family get togethers and simple dinner parties. After reviewing all of the games in the book, I found only one that I could use. The others require too much preparation. For instance, "Mad Advertising" has you record 20 commercial from the TV and find an obscure question to ask about the commercial. When the game begins, you show the commercial and ask the question, and see who gets the most correct answers. That's too much time and trouble, and not that fun. 
 Although I read the book to the end, it was a struggle.  The characters were superficial, the background descriptions unsatisfying and the denouement not particularly gripping.  Having been spoilt by Lindsay Davis's wonderful Falco series, I was hoping for something more evocative of daily life in Ancient Egypt but I never got a real sense of anything in this story.  I won't be reading any more adventures of Lt Bak 
 The best part of this book is the first page, and then it's all down hill from there.  There really isn't that much of a plot, and the book is just boring and stupid, and to be honest, just not very well written.  I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading this book 
 I have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time.  I couldn't force myself to get to the end.  Continually I turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn't.  The way she moves the point of view from Katharine back to the story is not enjoyable.  I would hate not to enjoy Philippa Gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again 
 I've replied to this request three times. The product was returned to vendor and cc charges were reversed 
 Maybe I haven't read enough "management" books (though I do have an MBA), but if this is considered "great" for this genre- WOW. This entire book could have been summed up in a couple pages without losing any major points, but I guess you can't have a bestseller that way! One reviewer said it was too technical. Are you living in a cave? I found it condescendingly written- absurdly simple and dumbed down. Granted, it's over a decade old, but I doubt everyone was really that much stupider ten years ago 
 A first reading of Ulysses is much more enjoyable without the blather of Blamires.  If you absolutely cannot grasp the intricacies, sybmols, themes, etc. of Ulysses without outside help then read the cliffs notes of sparknotes or if you are devoted then get Gifford's Ulysses annotated.  Blamires provides either too much information in some instances or not enough.  The book has too much plot transcription and not enough GOOD (and up to date) analysis (he relies on readings of Ulysses by 1940s critics and not upon more recent scholarship and trends).  Blamires tells toooooo much in the beginning.  He prejudices the reader to think about or know certain things that he or she should only know as they are revealed by the author.  For example, Blamires gives a bias to the reader by making him or her believe that Molly has been unfaithful many times before.  Yes there is a list of former lovers in Ithaca (I think it's Ithaca) but most scholars believe that Molly's tryst with Blazes is her first.  You don't need an "authority" to guide you through one of the greatest novels.  Simply pick up Joyce and begin reading.  To get the same effect of reading Ulysses with Blamires, just read Ulysses twice--it's much better the second time anyway! (Another more pragmatic reason for not buying it is that the price of this book is at least double Ulysses--not worth the mostly hum-drum plot summary. 
 I'm surprised that such a shallow, heavy-handed book was considered publishable.  From the start, the book pounds the reader with the main character's "double life" without a trace of grace or subtilty.  It reads like "young adult" fiction, except that it doesn't have any likable characters.  The one interesting result of reading this book is to see how such a potentially interesting topic like bigamy can be so boring when addressed by an incompetent writer 
 I love batman, but this version of batman is by far the worst version ever created (including all the live action, animation, or comic book versions of batman).  I have no clue why they are wasting animation resourses on a crap cartoon like this, when they could be putting it toward quality cartoons like Justice League.  Warner Bros. needs to get a clue.  I might not be a kid anymore (I'm the ripe old age of 21), but if I ever have kids I can promise you they will not be allowed to watch this.  They will be watching all of the Batman the animated series dvds that I bought last month.  Please parents (and kids) go buy those dvds (or superman the animated series, or justice league, or batman beyond, or x-men, or even teen titans) instead of wasting your money on this crapola 
 The West Wing is my favorite television show of all time.  Period.  Nothing else comes even close.  I could go on and on about the show, but others are doing an excellent job on that score, and that's not my point here.  My point is the awful, awful DVD.  No English-language subtitles (for the second year in a row).  Only two special features, both about the debate episode.  No insight from the actors about their take on seven years of ground-breaking television.  No tribute to John Spencer.  I feel as if the folks at Warner Brothers Television knew they had their market well in hand, so the quality of the product really didn't matter.  "No bother, we'll sell enough anyway."  I'm one of those that bought it anyway, but I feel as if I got ripped off.

 Murray, like Gardner and Crowley, was one of those early eclectics about her study of the Old Religion. There is too much supposition and not enough factual basis for her conclusions on the development of the "Witch God." The first chapter, however, is a great read following the earliset depictions of the horned god. But the jump to stating that these depictions from all over Europe at varying times are linked to a single cohesive religion is tenuous. This is yet another case in which the author has made the facts fit her conception rather than objectively trying to make connections between the facts. This is the case, unfortunately, for almost all early expositors of witchcraft and the Old Religion. Read the more scholarly "Triumph of the Moon" by Ronald Hutton if you're looking for objectivity rather than charlatanism 
 Buying the Complete Psionic was a lot like getting hit in the face with a custard pie.  Parts of it taste really good but I would have like the pie a lot better if the pie had been on my plate instead of in my face.  For those who don't know even though Bruce is listed as one of the two primary authors on the cover his was not the last hand that touched it.  After he wrote the first draft of the manuscript the material was handed off to a development team for further playtesting and refinement.  Then it went through final editing.  Somewhere in this process the proposed page count of the book went from roughly 190 pages to 160.  I'm sure Bruce had some input at various stages but I'm also sure that much of his material was changed substantially.  One example that he has admitted to was that he submitted only one "divine" class yet the final product had two, the Ardent & the Divine Mind.  This book has several major things going against it.  1. It is very poorly edited.  In addition to sloppy sentence structure and whatnot there are clear instances of where the development staff changed some of the original stuff.  If you look at the feat tables you will see that they indicate that some feats can be used "3+ Cha mod times per day" yet when you get to the feat text it's 1/day.  2. The errata changing Expanded Psionics Handbook (XPH) powers is poorly done and is mixed in with the new powers.  For example the Energy Missile & Energy Stun powers were changed so that the DC scaled +1 per 2 power points instead of the old +1 per 1 power point.  These were powers that had received complaints for scaling too quickly so this change was not entirely unexpected.  However, right there in the same section is a new energy power with the same old 1/1 scaling.  There are other examples where changes appear to be illogical.  But worst of all the things that seemed to most need errata, like clarification on the XPH Psychic Reformation power, were not done at all.  3. The content is very thin.  Only 8 Prestige Classes ... less than half of what appears in any other complete book & less than half of these are actually useable.  Only 6 new monsters and none of them are psionic constructs so the XPH feat "Craft Psionic Construct" is still unusable.    No fluff on running psi focused games ... unlike, say the Complete Warrior which has stuff on warrior focused games.  Lots of wasted space, for instance tables listing both the new powers in this book and all the ones from the XPH where all other Complete books just list the new stuff.  4. The "flavor" of Psionics is completely changed by this book.  In the XPH psi seems to be about "the power of the mind" and a psionic character is unique in that he is not dependant on outside forces or foci for his power.  His attack powers are based on creating an energy effect or affect the mind or body directly.  The Complete Psionic changes this radically.  Now some psychic characters get their powers from the gods.  They link to the inner and outer planes to create effects.  After this book there is literally nothing to separate a psion from a wizard, cleric, or paladin.  5. Many of the new powers, classes, and feats are underpowered.  For some reason the final product has an incredible focus on things that are useable once per day.  There are literally pages and pages of stuff that, if you take the class or feat you get something that can be used once per day.  This goes so far that they even mistakenly attribute some stuff in the XPH to be once per day when it is not.  With that said the book does have some very nice gems.  The Ardent & Lurk base classes are fantastically done and can be easily inserted into any ongoing game that has Psionics.  The Ardent in particular is a class that has wonderful flavor and enables one to play a "cleric" like character with a uniquely psionic feel.  The Divine Mind is mechanically interesting, being somewhere between a Paladin, Marshal, and Psychic Warrior, but the fact that they draw their powers directly from a deity disturbs me to no end.  I have no problem with a character who draws both on the power within and divine power, but I have a serious issue when WotC had deities granting psionic powers to folks.  Many of the feats are interesting and can find ready use in an ongoing game.  In fact this was probably the best section of the book for me in spite of the problems between the text and tables that I mentioned above.  Some of the new powers are useful, though plenty more are odd or seem out of place flavor wise.  The new race introduced by the book is very interesting, though I think that I would tend to use either them or the XPH Elan and not both.  I love the Erudite class & feel that it could easily be used alongside normal Psions instead of replacing them as the book suggests.  They have a fascinating blend of flexibility and restrictions that I find appealing.  I'm also big XPH Soulknife fan, and I have to admit that the Complete Psionic really delivers for them with new feats, Prestige Classes, and useful errata like the fact that dual Mind Blades can both be charged separately with Psychic Strike.  However, like the pie in the face, even though it has some great things going for it, in the end the Complete Psionic fails to deliver in a satisfying manner.  I strongly suggest actually reading some of the book before deciding to buy it.  In all honesty I would rather have had no new Psionic book rather than what was delivered in the Complete Psionic even though I will probably end up using bits and pieces of it ... and that's a hard thing for me to say since it was the psionics in the XPH that brought me back to DnD after a long absence. 
 Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.  However, despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as "a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot." Which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the "lost city", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.  I suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year.   Of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of "She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism, anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark. 
 This was an extremely useless book.  It lacked many words and was very hard to use.  I wish I had read the other reveiw before I bought it.  How can this be called "Official" when it is lacking in so much  information?  For example, DA is listed as a two letter word in the book,  but was actually removed from the official dictionary in 1998.  And, many  words that ARE acceptable in the dictionary are not listed at all.  This  can really mess a player up. If you want to lose at the game, use this  book. Otherwise, just don't buy it 
 Be sure you are planning to use this mug tree with large-handled mugs. Small mugs, like those that come with dinnerware sets, may not fit over the knobs on the ends of the arms. Also, two of the arms did not screw in properly 
 I used this text a few years ago when I was writing a paper on ethics of pesticide use, and it certainly details information well. However, the general tone is often anal and the writing style is extremely drab. Most of  the diagrams included were generated using low-budget graphics software,  and  it shows.  At 811 pages, this is an overly long book and not all the  chapters (24 total) can be covered in a single Echem course. Also, there is  no solutions manual and the problems Manahan gives are challening (a  section of numerical solutions placed in the back of the text would have  been nice...)  This is a good reference text, but  if you're looking for a  semester-long or short-term text to use for an Echem course, use Baird's  text, not Manahan's 
 I bought this book because I had heard of the author due to my knowledge of France and the French language.  (Also, I knew that his wife, Arielle Dombasle, was one of the most beautiful  women in France.  Although she is French, she was born in the USA to an American mother and she carries an American passport.)  I found the prose in the book somewhat rambling, disjointed, and seldom interesting, let alone entertaining.  The contents of the book just did not seem to have any real purpose or goal; it was mostly a random collection of thoughts and observations, many of which were seemingly pointless.  Perhaps it is unfair for me to say this, but this book just re-inforced my belief that one of the problems with France is that the country has too many so-called philosphers, of which BHL is one. 
 A movie of this nature generally draws extreme reviews, good and bad; personally I don't find it to be particularly bad or good nor can I relate to it, but i think potential buyers may like to know the fact that the film transfer was done rather badly for this DVD, which is worse than Dreamwork's "Forces of Nature" back in 1997. Dark scenes (like the one in the bar) looked extremely washed out and the resolution of the video was something between a VHS and a pre-1995 Laserdisc.  I would suggest anyone who's interested in this title to rent it first before considering purchasing 
 This film was very confusing and boring.  The dark tone of the scenery was depressing - hard to follow, I really think this should have been either colorful for an audience of children or more graphic for an adult audience.  It's almost like the director wasen't sure which audience he wanted to please and doing so didn't please either one.  Skip it 
 This book has numerous typos and mistakes, and does not explain very well how the stock market works 
 According to the author everyone has a built-in "blueprint for life." Her job and the reader's job is to discover what that is. But the discovery process is decidedly non analytical; trying to understand the past - the why's of this world - is non constructive, if not negative, in this venture. The reader, patient, or client ( the author runs a life coaching business ) must be future oriented, focusing on "wants" and not "shoulds." One should rely upon intuition and feelings far more so than "information." Furthermore, all areas of life are equally open to this approach: career, relationships, etc. Details on a micro level are irrelevant or get in the way.  Like virtually every so-called "self-help" book, the author maintains that the person in need of help is the primary obstacle to success. It is up to him or her to make the life-changing transformation, with of course the possible help of a life coach. The author gives the example of deciding on the day on which she was to be admitted to a mental facility, after five years of depression and therapy, to suddenly change her life. Apparently, multi-year depression is some sort of superficial malady that can be cast aside in a heartbeat, if only properly motivated. Also in keeping with the genre, the author admits to no social or economic structures or conditions that can and do present very real obstacles in attaining success in life. Issues like class, vastly unequal resources, or power dynamics apparently do not exist in the author's world. Being down-sized from a thirty year career is just another "opportunity" in life-coach speak, not a devastating blow that can be extremely difficult to overcome for many realistic reasons.  Granted it is possible to think one's situation to death. Analysis can be paralysis. But is success in life merely identifying wants, adopting the right attitudes, and getting out of the way to let it all happen? At one point, the author suggests that the "best life cannot help but find you." For many, life is just a bit more complicated despite efforts made that are least equal to any detailed in her book.  The target audience is not particularly clear. In one example, the author describes a supervisor becoming more effective by asking an employee "what" questions as opposed to "why" questions. That sounds like Mgt 101, not life transformation. In another case, a manager has "negative" guilt over firing an employee. When he realizes that he is helping the firm, apparently that constitutes "living your best life." And then there is the other extreme of  the author going from admittance to a hospital to life coach and successful author in a matter of a few years.   The book is just overly simplistic. It makes both unreal, exaggerated claims and does not realistically examine life's complexities and the difficulties in assessing and solving problems. In that regard, it may actually perform a disservice. The book offers mostly life cheerleading, which may be exactly what some are looking for.  
 This would probably be a great book to read if you are in the habit of reading a few pages here and there and easily forget what is going on.  To read it a few chapters at a time is almost torture.  This book could have easily have been 50 pages if we weren't reminded every paragraph that Sasha is 9 years older than Liam and he is a wacky artist and his family pushed him away and he can't be controlled and she is so very successful...blah, blah, blah.  Historically, I have really enjoyed Danielle Steele's books but this is one to skip 
 I just came accross this ad, and thought to say something about the price of this item.  Please be aware that many other merchants sell this product for about half the price.  
 There are only 16 pages of helpful knowledge, the rest of the book is charcoal drawings called 'StructureGuides' which are charcoal drawings of people that are not even scale enough to draw a professional rendering.  There is only one tidbit of information that other books don't have.  ... if you have ever drawn, designed, taken a basic drawing class ... consider buying a more advanced book, this one is beyond basic 
 First of all, consider the question that Lewis is trying to ask. What went wrong with the 'Middle East' and their 'failure' to modernize? And now think about how big this book is, about 150 pages. The 'Middle East' is a huge area extending from Morocco to Iran and he attempts to explain their 'failure' to modernize by reviewing the last years of the Ottoman Empire. That is just plain lazy work on the part of a historian who is supposed to be revered in his field.   Another issue is that he constantly refers to the 'Middle East' as 'Islam' as though Islam is homogenous or even centered in the Ottoman Empire. Granted the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was also the Caliph but the Twelver Shi'is don't consider him to be legitimate anyway. To consider Islam to have some kind of collective thought process when encountering the 'West' is reprehensible. Consider now the fact that the majority of Muslims don't even live in the Middle East or the Ottoman Empire. How can Lewis truthfully use the term 'Islam' in his book to refer to the entity that 'went wrong' when the area he's speaking about doesn't even constitute the majority of Muslims in the world!?   This book is a quick read for people who aren't in the field to think that they're informed about what is going on in the scary area known as the 'Middle East'. The worst part is that the only people who would know that this is full of holes and lacking greatly in background and professionalism are the people who wouldn't normally read it anyway. This is a dangerous book because the name Bernard Lewis is synonymous with Expert in Middle East affairs. This was a lazy, half hearted attempt to cash in on people's ignorance and only perpetuates the wrong ideas in people's minds. Bad Lewis, very very bad. Any 'liberal historian' who suggests this book should be beaten with this book, unfortunately for us the book is very thin so it will take a while to bring him down with it.  If you want better sources, look to John Esposito, Albert Hourani and Nikki Keddie. All of them have published widely and lack the obvious political biases of Bernard Lewis. Check them out. 
 The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.  As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide.. 
 These illustration are mediocre at best and I wish I had realized that they were an artists interpretation of monsters from historical sources, not direct images. Darn 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 Hide & Seek is the 2nd in a trilogy.  The first book, Kiss & Tell was fantastic.  It could easily be an action movie.  This one was rediculous!  A kindergarden teacher posing as a "hired girlfriend" for an internationally wanted drug lord, who's mother sells women into sexual slavery.  OH MY GOD!  Just because it is a romance novel is not an excuse for a stupid plot.  On top of that, there were so many errors in the book (grammar and clarity) that I wonder if the author had an editor.  And if she did, why didn't they do their job?  I loved te first book, but after this one, I'm not sure I'm gonna bother to read the third 
 This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The "show biz" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of "We Were Soldiers."--a much better, and far more honest, film 
 'Mimic Sentimel' is the result of mixing two kind of films -- look how Marvin, a patient confined in a room, watching through a camera the people living in the opposite apartment, AND how he gets invloved with a series of death by the killing human-bugs.  While spending time taking photos of the outside, Marvin and his sister Rosie come to think they have witnessed a murder, and call the police.  The standard plot device means that the cop would not believe in the story, or at least remain sceptical, and the thrill continues.  In this movie, inspted of that, the cop starts to have a date with Marvin's mom (Amanda Plummer).  Do you think we need this kind of plot development?  Anyway, after while the story strays into the alley, another girl comes into the room, named Carmen, and the two become Nancy Drew-like amateur detectives, and there is a strange man nicknamed 'The Garbageman' (Lance Henriksen, 'AVP' and many others).  But you don't see Grace Kelly here, nor Hitchcock's assured hand as director.  The film suffers from a very disjointed script, which doesn't know how to scare, or even amuse us.  The bad construction of the filmed shots only lead to the confused impression on our side -- actually, we don't know exactly whether some of the characters are killed or not, or how got killed.  The bad acting from the leads only lessen the scare, and first of all, you don't see the lethal bug itself very much.  The only good thing is the photography that captured the creepy mood of the backyard of a decayed apartment.  But the film is another disappointment from Dimention Films that once gave us 'Scream.'  And someone please send e-mail address of Tarantino to Amanda Plummer, who was in the epoch-making 'Pulp Fiction.' (You remember that terrific diner scene, don't you?)              
 I wavered awhile between three stars and two stars, because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as Sony and Akio Morita seem to deserve at least three. However, in the end, the book's errors just piled too high. It opens well, with the story of Sony's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after World War II, to becoming one of the world's great companies. This is a fascinating and inspiring story, and Morita tells it with flair.  Then, unfortunately, the downward spiral begins. Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every other Japanese company operates the same way, which is a fantastically wrong assertion (as the last thirteen years of Japan's seemingly endless recession have shown). He also frequently takes good basic management techniques, like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway, and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely "Japanese".  Then there are all the claims which are simply out-and-out false, such as Japan supposedly having the world's best construction technology. (It actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world, as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated.)  Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything. (Yet it only recently discovered the concept of "second-hand goods", instead of throwing nearly-new furniture and clothing away. Plus, Japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world's worst overpackaging.)  Reading between the lines, a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that Japan faces today. For example, Morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States. While this can, of course, sometimes be a serious problem, it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves. Japan's consumers, on the other hand, without an accessible court system, are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives. Complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored, because they lack any threat of legal action. In another example, Morita praises the "trust" and agreements without contracts that exist among Japanese corporations. In reality, this "trust" is a death pact, as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies, instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs.  Other than the glimpses into Sony's history and corporate culture, this book is only interesting as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of "Japan is going to take over" books that came out in the Eighties. Although, of course, considering all the "Internet companies are going to take over" books that came out in the Nineties, not even this is a uniquely "Japanese" phenomenon.   PS: Anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of Japan should read "Dogs and Demons" by Alex Kerr. 
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 This is a messy book that succeeds (to the degree that it does so) despite its flaws.  Some of the subjects are covered well, some covered poorly, and even where there is coverage, the discussions are maddeningly inconsistent.  First, the good: author Otto Friedrich was energetic in finding many former residents of Berlin as sources for this work, and some of the best parts of the book are their colorful reminiscences of their lost and ruined city.  Friedrich also included interesting chapters about the social milieu of the time, particularly the cultural scene: classical music, drama and the nascent motion picture industry.  And there are some nice character sketches of some of the leading artists of the era: Lotte Lenya, Bertolt Brecht and various musicians.  In general, despite the crazy-quilt nature of the coverage, Friedrich is best on the social history aspects of Berlin.  Now, the bad:  The book is very scattershot, a mile wide, but mostly an inch deep.  For example, in the discussion of the German movie industry of the time, although Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings are discussed, Peter Lorre, Ernst Lubistch and F.W. Murnau are discussed only in passing.  Among the pictorial artists, George Grosz is covered and discussed, but Becker, Nolde and scores of other artists get superficial or non-existent coverage.  And maybe it is inevitable to try to discuss the tangled political history of the Weimar era and the rise of the Nazis in a history of Berlin, but Friedrich is not a professional historian, and his weaknesses in this area are glaring.  Any reader with even a passing interest in the Weimar era will find far better accounts of the politics of the period than Friedrich's book. And even if you grant that he needed to discuss the political events of the day in  his work, there's a lamentable lack of focus to his political coverage, which mirrors the overall unevenness of this work.  For example, his descriptions of the combat in the streets between the Freikorps and the Communists in the immediate post-war period have the freshness and vitality that come from the testimony of eyewitnesses, and they give the reader a sense for the chaos that became horrifyingly prevalent in Berlin.  But his discussion of Germany's policies toward the payment of reparations (the Dawes plan and the Young plan, etc.) is, at best, superficial and misleading.  If you read this book, you might consider reading the sections that deal with the social history of the period and just skipping (or finding better sources for) the political history. 
 I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting.  I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good 
 I read many historical and theological books.  This book lacks organization and it lacks any academic references.  The vast majority of historical and/or theological books include bibliographies and footnotes or endnotes.  This book had none of these.  Further, as the book is an accumulation of essays and excerpts from many other sources, I would expect a bit of an explanation for each of the authors - especially the more obscure ones.  Now, that being said, I do agree with much of what this book purports, and have read other books that touch on many of the items addressed by this book.  However, I think this book is incomplete, and is not representative of the genre nor does it live up to its title 
 One tiresome, heavy-handed simile after another; agonizing, descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action; simplistic, trite phrasing and dialogue -- characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence, an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat; routine characterization; a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable; proofreading errors; fragmented, poor sentence structure -- this book is amateurish writing all the way around.  I cannot fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received.  I cannot understand the lack of proper editing.  I am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm, so imagine my disappointment when I was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the Prologue!  In fairness to the author (and with a hopeful attitude), I forced myself through the first 70 or so pages, however with each turning page I found myself reading along just for sport, my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous (and annoyed) with this juvenile effort. What could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time.  
 No creo que es  una buena compra este libro. El escritor no tomo en cuenta que las plantas tienen diferentes nombre segun cada pais.  Ademas no provee fotos; solamente dibujos a blanco y negro de las plantas.  No es convincente su contenido. La verdad, no lo recomiendo. 
 I've read many a good book....this is not one of them. For those that are rating it highly, I see them as those fools who said the King was wearing splendid clothes when in fact he was parding down the road naked; they think they are intellectuals when in fact they are misleading others. Granted, of the 240+ pages in my copy there may be ten with good content. I kept turning to the back inside cover to see the picture of the moron who wrote it 
 My opinion can be expressed by a single word: "Frustrating" As a Scientist who does not work within the field of Genetics, most of the terms I have hoped to find in the dictionary, surprisingly, are not defined!! As a single example, "two-hybrid analysis" is not included, in spite of being one of the most frequently used techniques within genetic analysis.  Probably, the Dictionary is addressed to readers outside from science. 
 Unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one.  Critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone.  The attempt to make the protagonist Milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story, which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often 
 This book reads like an encyclopedia of random shortcuts of keystrokes to cut down your use of clicky buttons.  I found it very difficult to just read from chapter to chapter because of the format the information is published in, an assembly of brief descriptions of tasks, one after the other.  I couldnt just start at page 1 and read to the back cover.  I'm not sure if the Mac verson of photoshop shows the shortcuts in every menu and mouse-over like the PC does so I cant speak for them.  But pretty much every function that has a keystroke shortcut on the PC has that keystroke noted.  The tips in this book were for the most part useless to me because over time, I've learned the shortcuts that were the most used by me.  I dont recommend this book to anyone but a beginner with photoshop.  The cover price of the book does not justify the few tips that could be useful.  Replace this book instead by memorizing the shortcuts as you see them in the menus and try the help function in the program itself.    EDIT:  I purchased this book because I loved the authors book titled "down and dirty tricks".  I definately recommend that book instead 
 The first two chapters were pretty clear and well written. But starting at chapter 3, everything seems to be unclear to me. I'm  more mystified about OOP than before! But I'm still reading the book and hopefully the rest of it may be more clear 
 My overview of this novel is that the author had very little concept of how she wanted to present a large collaboration of ideas and storyboards. She does not seem to possess a flare for fluid, concise storytelling and as a result, this novel "Chemical Pink" breaks up and goes many separate ways. The author hyper-develops one character, Charles, the eccentric female muscle hobbyist to such an exhausting degree and leaves the remainder of the characters as undeveloped afterthoughts. By the 10th instance of this creep's bizarre libido in the first 120 pages, I really wondered how this neverending lecherous spectacle would be essential to anything, and I still say this crude "Penthouse Forum" content had no major bearing on the story once it finally got going. It was just unconscionable shock value implemented to conceal (not very well) the story's deficencies. This is a very patchwork story; characters seem to always be at the right place at the right time, very reminiscent of a Wes Craven movie. The relationship between the female bodybuilder Aurora and her daughter Amy is so played out and uninspired it could have been pulled from any daytime soap. The dialogue, as a whole, is stale and predictable. I thought going in this would be a witfest imbedded with hauntingly funny dark humor, akin to Chuck Palanhiuk, whose novels always appear with this novel. It was nothing of that sort; it was dull, obvious humor with no signs of irony or underlying sentiment. I liken this novel, being a $13.95 psuedo-hardcover novel, to an expensive entree that sounds good on the menu printup, yet when you take that first bite, you wonder what you were thinking when you ordered it. Still, you feel obliged to cram the rest of it down your throat to feel that you at least got something out of the debacle.  That is how I felt reading this book 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 I really enjoyed The Perfect Storm.  So, I gave Ms. Greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book.  I was less than impressed.  I lasted till page 53 where I just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story. This is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of Junger's book.  Sebastian Junger's blurb on the cover was "Anyone who loves the sea will love this book"  I think not 
 I am so glad I read this book because it helps me feel OK about our family bed. HOWEVER I was hoping for some ways to get our baby to sleep better but solutions are sorely lacking. For those I found another Sear's recommendation: The No-Cry Sleep Solution, which supports cosleeping but also offers ways for everyone to get better sleep. If you want your family bed validated this is a great book 
 Every Pinon Press book has a title page with a money back guarantee coupon and information.  This is a lie.  When you send them the information and title page...they send the envelope back "Return to Sender."  There is no listed contact information for the company...just in case you ever feel like giving them feedback.  -Or asking them why they lie 
 This is an essential book. I rushed to it after finishing The Double Helix, by James Watson; I was incensed by Watson's misogyny and eager to learn the other side of the story. And this is the main accomplishment of Maddox's book, that it does give the other side of the story in a thorough and detailed manner. Too often, however, Maddox's tone slips into defensiveness, and her feminism appears to be a position she arrived at not as a result of rational thinking but because of her bitterness at the many injustices women have suffered at the hands of men.   I was troubled by this. I admire Rosalind Franklin -- yes, I have to admit that my admiration was nourished to a great extent by Maddox's book -- but I'm put off by how much of her biography of Franklin is a direct, self-righteous and self-justifying response to James Watson's flippant comments in The Double Helix. I was disappointed, for instance, by how much time Maddox spends explaining how sophisticated Franklin's taste in fashion was, simply because Watson made a snide comment in his book about Franklin's clothes and hairdo.   Another problem with Maddox's narrative is its pace. I found the book very hard to get through; paragraph after paragraph plods on, heavy with detail and almost empty of energy. I read The Double Helix in three days, breathless with excitement; for all its flaws, Watson's telling of the story sparkles. I don't look, when I read, to be entertained at the expense of truth, but I don't want either to be given the truth in a dry and awkward way. And Maddox's syntax is often awkward; I found myself going back again and again over her sentences to figure out what she was trying to say.   This material -- the story of Rosalind Franklin's life -- needs a better and more evenhanded writer, one who has nothing to prove and is aware that a biography, no matter how well-intentioned, can, just like the badly-intentioned ones, tell only one side of the story 
 I read some good reviews about this movie. In adition, I respect french's cinema, they usually gives us interested and unconventional movies. So, I bought "Spanish Apartment". A big dissapointment. Hughe one.  It's candid, it's "naive", it's boring, with poor ideas, poor acting, very predictable. There's a lot of good movies around you, don't waste your time in this one 
 Well, I was all set to dig into this "new" history of the "war of wars," but something caught my eye early on -- sloppy editing. For instance, on p. 23 we read "The wily Robespierre brilliant exploited their dilemma." As I've often remarked on student papers, "Is that a sentence?" Then, on p. 39, the third paragraph begins, "The Incobins." Obviously the author meant Jacobins, but where was the editor on that one? Sorry, but to slog through another 700+ pages of that kind of editing is troublesome. To the author's credit, he has attempted a monumental task, and it is a book that needs to be written. But when I read (p. 45): "The Jacobins left only their memory -- egalitarianism, revolutionary terror, escalating mass purges -- to inspire future generations of murderous revolutionaries, particularly Communists in Russia, China, Kampuchea, and elsewhere," well, that's when I closed the book and realized that what I had been reading was little more than undisguised polemic. It's probably history as well but there are better books out there 
 I ordered this October 1 as a gift and to date delivery date has been moved twice. It has been 6 weeks and amazon has just moved the delivery date another two weeks. If you can't deliver, then please remove this item from your list. 
 As the other reviews say this book is a 100% waste of money! For me it seems like the authors were just writing / speaking to here themselves speak. They also just give WAY to many examples of SGML and HTML for a history lesson - really zero actual examples of working XML. Also I found severl errors sprinkled across this text and I found myself always flipping back to see what these authors were talking about. The only good thing this book is good for is proping up a coffe table or keeping yourself warm next to a roaring fire as you use this book for fuel 
 Microsoft's development groups appear not to talk to one another, and for Internet Information Server that longstanding bad habit is a critical problem. IIS intersects systems, programming tools and applications (Windows Server 2003, Visual Studio and Internet Explorer). The Resource Kit is written from a systems perspective and has little to say about the other main actors. With the introduction of Visual Studio 2005, release 2.0 of the .NET framework, Small Business Server R2 and most recently Vista the material is badly outdated.  [...] As with other items written by Microsoft marketing staff, it is heavy on coverage, light on technical information and hard to use. Unfortunately IIS is a niche topic and so far has not attracted a skilled and knowledgeable writer who can integrate the several technologies and perspectives needed to explain it. 
 This biography on the Wrights is a confused mess.  Adams tells the story by visitng locations where the Wrights made history, but during these travels we learn more about his modern day random encounters than what the Wrights actually did there.  Adams goes on for pages about capturing moths, a boy and his heroic dog, and other such tales which have nothing to do with the Wrights.  This biography also neglects describe the Wrights childhood and what might have made them the brilliant engineers they became.  The book really focuses on everything after the Kitty Hawk flight.  This is its biggest strength in describing how they traveled the world to show everyone their flying machine, including moments of triumph and tragedy.  The book finds down by focussing on the Wrights' sisters love affair.  I got the feeling that the author felt their needed to be a romance somewhere in the book, and since the Wrights were more focussed on machines than women that he needed to waste our time with this barely relevant affair 
 Once again, Hollywood runs out of ideas and remakes a movie that doesn't need to be remade.  Even with more colorful characters, there really is no need for this!  Save yourself time and watch the original 
 The last line of my review comes first:  If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.  And now the review:  I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time.  And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.  The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.  This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor.  The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel.  The characters are all church characters.  And the god is not so godly.  Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.  Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly: (last line of the review 
 Now, don't get me wrong - I am a Starhawk fan, and I am a Pagan.  I loved 'Spiral Dance', and enjoyed 'Dreaming the Dark' and 'Truth or Dare'.  I really did want to enjoy this book.  However, Starhawk's considerable literary talents do not seem to cross over into the realm of fiction.  What's wrong with this book?  Well for a start, it's VERY simplistic.  The pagans are all loving, bi-sexual, multi-cultural and good.  The christians are all fundamentalist, violent, middle class and bad.  The pagans are a little too perfect and a little too self-satisfied with their own cunning to be truly engaging characters.  I agree that it's rare and lovely to have a novel where the pagan characters are good people, but this is a bit heavy-handed.   Secondly, Starhawk shies away from addressing any really hard questions.  Everything about the pagan utopia is great.  Everything about the fundamentalist regime is bad.  There's no dialogue between the two groups at all, and no suggestion that the two might learn anything from each other.    Thirdly, the plot is a stinker.  It is nothing but a vehicle to express Starhawk's philosophy.  The characters are wooden, and the plot is very predictable.     I really wanted to like this book.  Instead, it made me cringe.  Bottom line?  Read any non-fiction work by Starhawk.  If you want to read good pagan fiction, try 'Mists of Avalon' (Marion Zimmer Bradley), 'The Light Bearer' (Donna Gillespie), or even Wyrd Sisters (Terry Pratchett). 
 I was about to buy this product yesterday, and the price jumped up (yet again!) from $49 to $72!   I can understand a little inflation every now and then, but, judging from other reviews, this is ridiculous.  Literally one night passed and now I can no longer afford this keyboard.  Thanks Amazon 
 This is a good book with lots of great information about the incestuous relationship between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family.  The relationship is repugnant, especially in view of the fact that fifteen of the nineteen 9/11/2001 hijackers were Saudi nationals; in light of the apparent White House managed flights that helped some 140 bin Laden and Saudi royals to escape the U.S. only days after the murderous attacks on American soil.     Quite honestly, I wonder why an otherwise intelligent man like Craig Unger would receive and prominently display an endorsement from an extremist-bigot like Michael Moore on the front cover of his book.  Why not include on the cover other luminary Jew-haters and Israel-haters such as Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan, Cindy Sheehan, John Dingell and Cynthia McKinney?  Unger indicates no personal Jew-hatred or anti-Semitic tendencies in his book.  Why then did he resort to a bigot like Michael Moore for an endorsement 
 Dr. Andrew Fielding, a quantum physicist, is killed, although it's made to look like he died of natural causes. David Tennant, MD, assumes he's next. They are two of the six men in the inner circle of the scientific team funded by National Security Agency working on Project Trinity.  Trinity is a massive, secret (big surprise!) government-funded effort to build a supercomputer dedicated to artificial intelligence - a computer that thinks. David is on the team to keep the ethics in line, as he is a Professor of Ethics at the University of Virginia Medical School. He has been seeing a psychiatrist, Rachel Weiss, the past few months because of his narcolepsy, the side effect he encountered after undergoing his `superscan' into the Trinity computer. All six of the inner circle had been scanned and each had a different side effect. Thus, his crusade to find the cause of everyone's neurological symptoms.  David figures out who killed Dr. Fielding, so he and Rachel have to make a run for it. The story details their narrow escapes, David's realization of who is betraying him, and how he overcomes these difficulties. Who do you trust is really a big question. Trinity `goes live' and causes chaos and confusion around the world. David and Rachel play a big part in getting Trinity working for good, not evil.  This was a tad too sci-fi for my taste and too long, partly because of the detailed descriptions of David's hallucinations (where he sometimes sees himself as Jesus).  If you're a computer nut and like technical subjects, you'll like this book 
 I never thought that I'd say this about an Eagles song, but "Hole In The World" is an absolutely trite piece of pop music aimed straight at the soul of every bleeding-heart sappy American who's old enough to toddle to a record store and lay out their allowance money on the counter to buy this.  It's aimed at a teenage audience, and yet sounds like it was written by four-year-olds.  This kind of crap should be left to the now defunct Backstreet Boys or 98 Degrees, not a classic rock dynasty like the Eagles.  Rest assured that this will in no way taint songs like "Victim Of Love" or "Desperado" or the rest of their great songs, but though Glenn Frye once sang "Smuggler's Blues", he should have some far greater blues for being a part of this horrid little song 
 this book was very disappointing. i LOVED her 1st two books. so when this book came out i was very excited. after reading it, i found it was rather dull and not very funny. there were very few parts that actually made me laugh, unlike her 1st two books 
 I was so disappointed in this book. I found it very hard to believe that Jonathan Kellerman actually wrote this book. I found it downright corny the way Alex Delaware was playing ace detective and kept just happening to be at the right place at the right time. The book seemed to have no "story" to it, as his always do. I got very bored reading one and a half pages of descriptions of what people were wearing, how their hair looked and on and on. I always enjoyed Kellerman's breif descriptions of people and places, but once again, this became downright corny.  I'm glad this was not my first Kellerman book, as I probably wouldn't try another one. I'm a dedicated reader of his and hope that this was just a fluke. Everyone's entitled to one bad book. Hope that was his first and last 
 I was disappointed with this book since it is not as good as the ab book in this series. It mostly features exercies to do in a gym 
 I have been a devoted Hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation.  Although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical, the story is just so silly I found it hard to keep my attention focused.  I compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which I do with my children on occasion.  Sorry, I just couldn't finish it 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 Read the previous review. The unaltered version (with the exact same title and similar song list) is still available (at the time I wrote this) here on Amazon through the Club and private sellers. Good Luck 
  I FOUND THIS BOOK HARD TO UNDERSTAND WITH THE WORDS THE AUTHOR USED, IT WAS NOT A GOOD READ, IT TOOK ALOT FOR ME TO GET THROUGH IT. SHE REPEATED HER SELF SEVERAL TIMES AND SOME THINGS DID NOT MAKE SENSE. I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WOMEN VOLUNTARILY WENT TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMP WITH HER PARENTS AND CHILDREN. IF SHE WANTED TO BE WITH HER HUSBAND WHY DIDN'T SHE GO AND LEAVE HER CHILDREN WITH HER PARENTS. ALSO THE ENTIRE BOOK WAS TO CLINICAL. I HAVE READ SEVERAL  BOOKS ABOUT THE HOLCAUST AND THEY WERE REMARKABLE THIS ONE WAS NOT , I SHOULD HAVE SAVED MY MONEY 
 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 I just read this short story and I didn't like it is just to hard to read and their is really nothing that makes you want to keep on reading this story.  It is verry (not my type).  I read better stories by better  authors.  A good author is Dean Koontz now he has good books and stories.   You would probably like Dean Koontz  more than this Edgar Allan.  Without  having to be confuse at any moment while your reading 
 I bought "Simplify Your Life" by Elaine St. James and I loved it.. so naturally, I thought this would be a good purchase.. it's EXACTLY the same thing!!  So yes, I feel like she ripped me off and added to the "clutter" in my bookshelf by trying to meet some sort of publishing quot 
 I have no quibbles with Balzac or anything the man wrote.    However, contrary to what the "Book Description" says, "The Forsaken Woman" (or "La Femme Abandonee") is not contained within the pages of this collection.  I would not even bother mentioning this except that I was specifically looking for a copy of that particular story. I've loved it since I read in it its original French back in high school. I just now found a copy of it on the Internet for free thanks to Project Gutenberg -- you may want to do the same thing if you're after a particular story or want a nice sampling of all that M. Balzac has to offer.   Note to AMAZON: It would be nice if whoever writes the book descriptions would actually pick up the item in question and, at the very least, take a look at the Table of Contents. 
 Big Weather?  WRONG!!!!  This guy covers philosophy, map making,religion, his philosophical ideas to the point of nausea, old world history, pages & pages about Mary MacLane, oh yeah, and almost as an afterthought there are some pages about weather & chasing.  But still laced with his philosophy. NOT a book for anyone except maybe self styled "intellectuals 
 This sounded like a great item.  However, it has proven to be useless.  First, it won't stop a child from opening the door.  Second, when the door is opened, the guard falls out. When the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut, thus the child can't pinch their fingers.  However, the "catch", which goes behind the door, is too small, enabling it to fall through.  
 if your not going to take the time to read the book, then do the literary community a favor and remain ignorant of the story instead of using half assed cliffnotes written by some guy/corporation hell bent on swindling dollars out of stupid clueless people. when books are assigned to you in class your main task is clear. read the damn book! if this is too hard for you then why are you thinking reading a set outline of vague notes would be any better? to the people that have problems reading. just practice god damnit! it doesnt take magical skills to learn how to read, some people just take longer than others (even years) but if you keep practicing you should eventually be able to read on your own without the help of some stupid douche 
 I read this in passing at the new San Jose Main Public Library the other day. These coauthors' writing is as harsh as Ann Coulter's but of an opposite persuasion.  However, their use of citations and supporting documentation is lacking.  It is mostly up to the reader to guess which points are supported by which references in the bibliography.  There are no footnotes, just mere page number references.  A great number of references are simply for the sprinklings of quotations used.  The fact, that Alterman and Green are employed by any journal, is chilling and an insult for that employer. Alterman, intending to attack "neocons," uses an example of voter intimidation in places like Baltimore where the "Get out the Vote" advertisments also say "...and take care of your oustanding warrants, overdue rent, etc..."  Another example is one that persuades people to show up at the polls days after election day.  [Incidentally, the book's issues like this are debatably related to the topic of President Bush...] So much for the idea of a "well-informed electorate!" Such voter intimidation is not just sad but almost laughable. First, does anyone want to admit depending on a voter base of individuals who fall for intimidation like this?  This was an insult to liberal causes!  To think this was a great book, you too would probably fall for voter intimidations like these examples given by Alterman and Green. Second, are these guys trying to tell us that a qualification, to be considered a minority, consists of being duped by garbage like this?  What an insult to minorities! Third, if these guys are responsible journalists, can they report on anybody of their own polity that might be doing something about the state of the electorate's information?  While Alterman and Green make this point on their own voter base being so inadequate with any base of knowledge, they are trying to make a point, by begging the question from the first page, that President Bush himself has a very inadequate base of knowledge.  Worse yet, Alterman and Green propose that a bad state of knowledge is further demonstrated by President Bush's tendency to ask "stupid" questions.  Perhaps all readers should reflect on whether it is better to have stupid questions asked than to have stupid results occur when nobody has the courage to ask stupid questions.  And back to the concept of a "well-informed electorate," real education begins with real questions.  It is too bad that Alterman and Green have evidently been too proud to ask any questions, starting with "Why did so and so ask such and such question?" instead of jumping to their conclusions.  Another example of Alterman and Green's points is that President Bush's tendency to leave the "details" to others is a weakness.  It would have been more useful to their point to expound on how this balances one's own core competencies with those of others.  It's an effective corporate strategy.  Maybe journalists know nothing about that.  Alterman and Green's publication is a strike out for journalism. If you are a proponent of progressiveness or of the idea of a "well-informed electorate," this book does not help either of these causes 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 "The Home Organizing Workbook" by Meryl Starr is the type of book that is design to catch the reader attention of the shelve. But, once the reader takes a close look at it. The reader begins to realize that while it has some useful information there are better organizing books on the market. If you are interesting reading it, just check it out, and save your money 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 This phone could quite possibly be the biggest piece of technology crap. Its useless, the software on it is very cheap and childish. Not professional at all, the camera is pitiful, and the keys are too small for anyone who doesn't have 10yr old hands. Just because it has a qwerty keyboard; that doesnt mean that it is an outstanding phone when in reality this is a waste of cash. Purchase a different phone this one is not worth it 
 The Tee was too light weight, the neck line was too low and I will chalk this up to experience and probably not wear any of the three I bought.  Probably will use them as rags to wash the car 
 Another "Me Too" book. Nothing new in this book that you can find in a hundred other better books 
 I live in Shanghai part time and this book is interesting to me because I can walk around the city and imagine... but the book seems very biased and is more interested in sensationalizing the city then a true analysis of the wonder that is Shanghai.  In a way I am saddened by her reflection because it runs down the same path as most 'Westernized' views of China; I realize that this sells books, but when will authors take the responsibilty of serious reflection about place and significance rather than feed the reader with exotic half-truths.  Before I ramble more (my highscool grammar teacher will cry if she reads this), I would suggest that one decide what they want out of a this book before purchasing... If you want a decently engaging story - this is ok... If you want to know about Shanghai's 'essence' look elsewhere, Stella Dong misses the real story and the real city.  
 This thing is a nightmare. First, it is impossible to understand unless you already know how to run some other comparable system. Next, it requires a huge amount of fiddling with buffers (believe me -- read the help files on this, which are huge and suggest ten different things to do when your music doesn't sound good, and trust me, it won't, either before or after unlimited tweaking). Finally, it actually does not export as it says it does. It lost my files, including one song I cannot quite reproduce (gone forever). Bottom line: If your idea of fun is spending two weeks of vacation fiddling with software that does not work and will never work, then by all means, buy this garbage. I have been using computers since 1985, and this is, I think, the worst single product I've ever seen. On the other hand, if you want to actually make music, you might want to try Sony's ACID Pro 6, which you can try out for free (the company thinks you'll like it, whereas the sadists at Cakewalk must know perfectly well that you won't, hence no demo). 
 Interesting book if interested in author. His claim to have Hepburn at his beck and call until he found someone "better" sounds a bit self serving in light of the fact Hepburn never mentioned the supposed affair to any of her friends according to Barry Paris' book on Audrey. Could it be that Ben is a legend in his own mind 
 If you wish to learn something interesting re the fact that the keys of b minor and Bb major share the note D as their third, you would do far better to consult a decent recording of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata than this navel-gazing narcissistic atrocity 
 The musicians and the songs beat most contemporary bands but I had to rate it an overall two stars due the electic clashing style 
 When I first learned about this book I was so excited.  I had just started gripping on feature films and I thought I would be able to pick up some tips.  Sadly, while Mr. Uva has been Key Gripping for years, he fails to  provide true insight.   While this book is great for people who have never  worked with film equipment, at 30 clams, I regret the purchase. If you have  gripped before, I would pass on this one 
 Very average quality speaker system. Too much noise even at low volumes. Even with highest recording quality files, the volume is horribly noisy. 
 I ordered this book in September, and four months later, it still had NOT been delivered.  I cancelled the order in frustration and will not be pursuing it any further.  What a disappointment 
 A joke that swept through The University of Texas a long time ago:  A freshman physics teacher at Texas A&M asked his class to name the greatest invention of all times.  One student said fire.  Another said gunpowder.  Another said the internal combustion engine.  Then a Texas A&M football player on the front row said, "The thermos bottle."  When asked by the teacher why he would pick that as the greatest invention, the student said, "You put something hot in it and it stays hot.  You put something cold in it and it stays cold."  The teacher asked why that made it great, and the student replied, "How do it know which to do?"  That thermos bottle is in this book in the form of a magic (indistinguishable from magic) sphere.  I liked the first book, in spite of its "magical" science.  This novel seemed like a shaggy dog story leading to the thermos bottle.  Much ado about little 
 While the story was nice and the characters interesting.  I really resented the fact that the historical details were really off base.  I study gothic tapestries and have written many papers on them, and I worry that people who read this book might think it was real. 1. the tapestry was woven between 1480 and 1490 which means brussels would not have been the center of tapestry weaving at this time.  The prevailing expert theory is that this tapestry was woven in Arras, which has given its name to big tapestries which is why you sometimes hear them referred to Arras in England.  2. the earliest recorded evidence of a low warp loom was 1501 before that they use high warp looms or Haute Lisse.  Low warp looms were referred to as Basse Lisse.  Which means that the tapestery would have been woven on a high warp loom or vertical loom, not a low warp loom, or horizontal loom.  this means a couple of things.  First there would have been no pedals and second at any time the weaver would have been able to walk around the loom and look at the weaving instead of only seeing 4 inches at a time.  3.  Lisse means warp in french in known of my studies have I ever seen reference to the master weaver as Lisse.  Why would anyone say the master weaver was warped.  The master weaver would have been referred to as a "tapessier" or even a "weaver of arras"  and probably in the shop master.  Though the use of this word did give an exotic flare it was an innappropriate use of the word.  4. the tappesier guild was in full bloom and in all likelihood did object to women working, but they weren't the tyrants that are portrayed in the book until well into the 16th century.    I must commend the author in making up a weaver because at that time the artisan seldom took credit for the work.  The credit was taken by the donor or the one that commissioned the work.  So that was an interesting realistic touch.  I worry about the holes because holes like that have a tendency to become "fact" in the minds of those that read the book.  ONce you are aware of the holes you can enjoy the story and not many people study the creation of Gothic Tapestries.  And the Gothic era is considered the high point of tapestry weaving.  Enjoy the story but don't believe the historical aspects of it.  It just doesn't fit in 
  As soon as I realized who was in this film, I knew how it was going to go. Its Pierce Brosnan . Playing James Bond with another name. In this movie he's a rich guy {thief} with a thing for art. Of course, he kept all of his UNCANNY charm from his Bond roles.  If you wanna see Brosnan {effortlessly} make fools of EVERYONE {like he does in every movie he plays in} then this is for you. Personally I find it hard to care about a character that NEVER has it rough. 
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 Don't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch.  This monitor is sold as "providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout".  Since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout Reebok did to substantiate this claim.  Get a strapped monitor for working out.  While this is a great idea the design doesn't match the intended purpose 
 I did laugh and was mildly entertained and never bored with this one.   The DVD commentary also includes some other stories that are also pretty funny and explain some of the pitfalls of an underfunded movie, which explains some of the end product here, I would think.  Of course, I had seen the Ebert&Roeper review of this movie beforehand so I was not expecting much.  In fact, I was curious about a movie they found so terrible.  And "Dirty Love" is not all that great, it was not as bad as I expected either.  My wife hated...HATED...this film, so I would not call it a "chick flick". 
 Stay away from this translation - it's the pits! The vocabulary is very contemporary and there is no lyricism. The more poetic passages come off as...florid, overheated. There has to be a better translation 
 Copyrighted in 2001, the Cisco CCNP library has already been rendered obsolete by Cisco themselves.  Not only exam revisions, but a fundamental structural change to the CCNP examination series has taken place in the short time since these books were put on the market.  Unfortunately, I can see no other benefit to these books beyond providing a revenue stream to Cisco.  There are better books available if one is looking for truly educational technical books rather than exam-specific guides 
 Well, I recorded this movie last night on Starz and watched it this morning alone (husband had gone to work), I turned the lights out, watched on our big screen tv, but, I don't know, maybe I'm getting too old, but I never got tense, nervous, and certainly never jumped with fright. I have never played and know nothing about the game.  I have to admit that it was very atmospheric, eerie and creepy looking, just not atmospheric enough to impress me that much. One problem may be that either my tv is too dark(or was it meant to be seen like that in the movies?), but I had a hard time actually seeing a lot of the demons/monsters clearly and not sure exactly what I was seeing.  While I don't mind this to an extent if it's done for the look of the movie, I really needed to see everything a little clearer.  The only way I found out what the triangle/pyramid head demon did to the woman Anna or Anne (forgot her name) was through the reviews that I have just read.  And I agree with 1 reviewer who doesn't like reviewers to reveal the endings of movies but in this instance I am glad one did because my tv stopped recording with 24 seconds left, and I just know something major was going to happen in those last seconds.  I had a lot of problems with the plot, so again I'm glad some people spelled it out somewhat.  I really think you have to have some knowledge of the game to appreciate this more.  I thought the acting so-so, good enough for this type movie, since you usually go for the visuals/horror/etc, not great acting.  Even though I didn't think much of it overall, I'll still watch the last 24 seconds when it's shown again on tv, just to see the ending even though at least one reviewer already spilled the beans ( I guess their review's are fairly accurate).  I think had I seen this at the movies on a really big screen with surround sound, audience reaction, etc, I would have enjoyed it more. It's kind of like watching  a good special effect/battle/epic movie on tv a year after seeing it at the movies, it becomes deflated somewhat.  But to be honest, I have never jumped in my seat, or been afraid to look at the screen during most horror movies I have seen.  I really wish I could have seen the monsters/demons better, I assume had I  been able to do so it might have scared me some 
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
 Strange stuff--Duvall rants, gibbers, and fires a shotgun into an empty closet. Haas watches, listens, and smiles a lot. The great James Earl Jones wanders in, scratches his beard and mutters to himself, and walks out again. If this sounds like your kind of thing, jump right in. But nobody's ever going to claim this is Horton Foote's finest hour 
 Well, three German punks kidnap a rich guy (it doesn't really matter why).  Most of the dialogue consists of a leftist rhetoric that hasn't been heard since the 1960s.  There are lots of gloomy shots of the various characters brooding with vague looks on their faces.  Two of the kidnappers are male, one is female.  Of course there's a love triangle.  They drink quite a bit and smoke some pot.  Eventually they decide to let the guy go since they aren't the killing types.  There's a silly little twist at the end that is good for a laugh.   Find something else to do with your two hours, unless you want to practice listening to German. 
 This movie was loaned to Me, (Thank God I did'nt rent it) and is the biggest waste of a few hours of My life ever! The acting is so horrible it made Me cringe,and the cuts in the movie were done to where it seemed like it had been edited for tv.This is supposed to be a black comedy? It's NOT funny, and the so called violence in it made Me yawn, seriously, I've seen more gore on the Simpsons. There are so many things in the movie that are AMAZINGLY unbelievable, K. Sutherland walks for miles to a hospital with a bullet through His neck, head,and two in the back.R. Witherspoon overpowers Sutherland (For the second time) and strangles Him, pretty good for a 90 pound teenage girl huh?  But, I do think Everybody should watch this movie once so You can see what a movie should NOT be.(Besides, misery loves company 
 Tony Morrison is an excellent writer. I simply anticipated more out of her before reading this book. Maybe it is my problem as a white male, but I expected more raw emotion from her characters or better insight on the people she wrote about, or, alas the plight of the African-American woman. Maybe that was the point of the book to show that all of these human emotions have been locked up due to terrible circumstance and treatment 
 Funny and very inspirational. Good way to encourage young teenagers to build self esteem. If there's a will, there's a way. Anyone can dance 
 It simply sucks.  It does not help with estimating in a landscape company.  Also it's too difficult to understand and too complex.  All I wanted to know is how to estimate walkways patios, decks, tree removal, etc....   This book does not do it.  [...]you will see how bad this book is. 
 C. S. Lewis exposed the circular reasoning in Hume in the book "Miracles."  David Hume was not a skeptic.  He was a freemason and therefore a gnostic.  He was only skeptical of nongnostic positions, such as Christianity.  He was an apologist for gnosticism.  He had blind faith allegiance to the masonic lodge and its creed.  His argument against miracles is his chief argument against Christianity, and it suffers from circular reasoning.  Circular reasoning you exclaim?  Yes.  Hume argued that miracles violate uniform experience.  However, if uniform experience is against mircales, then they cannot happen.  Uniform experience is his presupposition.  But, uniform experience is defined to exclude miracles.  If they didn't happen, well, they didn't happen.  This begs the question.  I have a better argument than Lewis's.  I would simply point out that pure logic cannot dispense with the empirical question of whether miracles happen.  Afterall, mathematics is made up of tautologies.  As such, mathematics or logic or any formal reasoning cannot have physical meaning.  Pure logic, as Hume employs, cannot tell us anything about the world.  Therein lies the sophistry.  It boils down to the distinction between analytic statements and synthetic statements.  Whether or not miracles happen depends not on logic, but on the existence of God who intervenes in human affairs.  As the former atheist Antony Flew said, it is impossible to argue against the existence of God in light of the evidence of intelligent design of the universe.  If anyone went to the moon and found a house there that supplied oxygen, food and other human necessities, they wouldn't hesitate to posit a creator of that house.  So why would anyone question the existence of God in light of this wonderful planet that supports our lives?  What is remarkable about him is how irrational he is.  He possesses a flair for writing and shows great promise in reasoning.  Yet, he sacrifices good reasoning for pushing his gnostic agenda.  It's like a person who graduates from medical school who decides to murder patients, or a graduate from law school who chooses to rob banks.  He tries to use reasoning to support irrational thought.  Hume was a strange man.  The engine is running, but there's no one behind the wheel.  
 I cannot imagine what Sony or their sad, sad technicians were thinking - or NOT thinking when they "remastered" this great musical.  I HOPE - and one can only hope - whomever it was that "remastered" this music (and I can't imagine why they would call it re-MASTERED) that they got FIRED afterwards or went back to basic recording school.  MASTERING a musical CD means that you check your levels and balance - something they either forgot to do or were too busy talking while they should have been listening to what they were doing.  Did Sony imagine they'd be able to sell this on it's own merits...that being an attractive, well known, sell-able music CD of a charming musical - while duping the buying public (sadly ME included) that it would be something worth having for any Broadway music collection??  Well I was most assuredly fooled.  Even with my cheap (Sony by the way) 2 track tape deck could have come up with better than this rendition.  I just cannot abide that some highly technical "master" of recording equipment couldn't fix this before the thing was committed to a glass cd master to be cut in quantity, offered and distributed as a "remastered" version that SHOULD have been BETTER than the original but sadly isn't even close.  I thankfully, still have a cassette tape version of this musical from when it was first released many years ago and prefer that to this impossible display of cd "mastering" I have EVER heard - and I've heard a lot of quality remastered CD's - but this isn't one of them.  THE ONLY saving grace of this CD is some of the extras that have been included.  But not at full price..if you ask me.  Think twice or at least understand at the outset what you're getting....a very poorly "rekindled - NOT remastered" CD that has some singers sounding as if the "technicians" forgot to bring up the volume on those tracks.  Pretty sad, pretty sad.  Disappointing.  Love the musical - HATE the lousy CD 
 This is the WORST transfer to DVD I've ever seen!!! I think the VHS copy looks and sounds better, do NOT waste your money!! 
 One needs only two Sex Pistols' albums: "Never Mind the Bollocks" and "Rock n Roll Swindle." There's just nothing out there that even remotely resembles the Pistols' version of 'Roadrunner' ("Steve, wait...wait....I don't know the f'n words!") and the pieces by Jones and Cook are excellent, and a great preview of their work together in The Professionals. For those who wish to go deeper, in addition to "Swindle" and "Bollocks," I'd recommend John Lydon's first album with PIL featuring "Religion I & II," ("Fat pig priest, sanctimonious smile...") along with PIL's greatest hits or Metal Box, also any work Lydon did with Leftfield, e.g. "Open Up"; anything by The Professionals is great ("I Didn't See It Coming"), and the soundtrack to 'Sid & Nancy' if only for the atmosphere provided by Pray for Rain and The Pogues. (By the way, if interested, you can probably find a few clips of Steve Jones and The Professionals in action on YouTube. Highly entertaining. 
 This might make a good book for your teenage kid trying to learn about small business but other than that I dont think it would be helpful.  If you really want the details of how to create and grow a real business (especialy high tech) and get funded, you should read "The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs"  (Stathis).  It makes this book looks like preschool. 
 I feel like the Grinch of all time for saying this, but Linda Richman is really not that funny. Mike Meyers based The Coffee Tawk Lady on her, but it's Mike Meyers that's funny, not his muse. So if you're looking for someone who can make you laugh out loud through your tears, I suggest you look elsewhere. That said, her advice was sound. Her heart is good, her tips are wise and accessible, and she seems like she has a good heart. But sorry, she's not a laugh riot. And her wisdom, while sincere and hard-earned, was not all that insightful 
 As a former teacher and current homeschooler, I find that much of the material in the early levels of this series are not appropriate for the grade levels indicated.  I use the books as references but not usually at the grade indicated by the title of the book. The history sections are especially inappropriate. Children at these early grade levels do not have enough background knowledge (i.e., comprehension of the passage of time and the geography of the earth in relation to their own place in it) to fully understand the material presented. Thus, they are very unlikely to retain the knowledge or to apply it meaningfully to other areas of study. Parents trying to stick to these grade levels are bound to be frustrated 
 Don't buy this product. It leaks water badly. It does not get hot enough to press your clothes the way it advertises. I tried it on a few different types of clothes jeans, sweaters, tee shirts, etc, just to be sure I gave it a fair shot. It just does not simply live up to it's claims. If you can afford it, buy one of the more expensive one's. This is a waste of time and consumer money 
 Sadly I struggled to get the examples running. You would think it would be a case of cut and paste and compilations, but there are spelling mistakes even in the first code examples. Obviously the code was not tested before it was published in the book 
 There's one reason and one reason alone that I was very interested to hear Midnattsol's debut album "Where Twilight Dwells", and it was because Liv Kristine's sister Carmen Elise Espanaes has the vocal duties for the band. Now I'm a huge fan of Liv's work with Theatre of Tragedy and later Leaves' Eyes, so I was curious to hear whether the talent was genetic or unique.  Unfortunately, things have not turned out the way I had hoped as this is mediocre folk influenced gothic metal that doesn't really interest me at all. As far as Carmen goes, there are occasions when she slightly resembles her awesome sister's vocal talent, but most of the time she falls way short. In fact, there are some highly cringe-worthy moments here, but it's not entirely Carmen's fault. Some of the lyrics are truly atrocious, and the music itself is pretty average as well, so she's on a hiding to nothing. I don't really have a problem with folk music's infiltration of metal, but when it's done poorly, it becomes quite embarrassing. They may be trying to achieve atmosphere over quality musicianship here, but there's nothing original or inspiring enough to make me pay attention.  Most critics seem to be receiving Midnattsol's release at the same time as label-mates Draconian's latest album "Arcane Rain Fell". It probably doesn't help Midnattsol's cause that Draconian's doom/death album is far superior to this and makes it look pretty bad in comparison.  There are a couple of tracks that stop me from completely panning it and make me believe that Midnattsol could possibly do something decent, but I'm pretty sure "Where Twilight Dwells" will struggle to find itself in my CD player in the future. If you still want to give it a shot after reading this, then I suggest you check out my local 2nd hand record store. You'll be in with a shot 
 This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?   I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie.  
 Blends Freudian psychology with pop Buddhism using vague language and empty metaphors to create an impractical guide devoid of meaning or depth 
 I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it.  There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there.  I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out:  I consider this a VERY bad start 
 The pathetic thing about scams like this is that we're all searching for ways to secure our future. The thing is, Russ Whitney was a smart guy who did some real estate investing... then, he decided to become SMARTER and offer his "Secrets to Success" to everyone else for a fee!  How intelligent is that??? Be realistic people. There are no (legal) shortcuts to fortune other than hard work, inheritance, or winning the lottery. There is money to be made in real estate, and SOME gains may be as easy as he makes them look but the bulk of them are not. Am I rich? No, but I'm comfortable enough NOT to be willing to make someone ELSE RICH by buying products that only sell dreams. Due TRUE research people. Go to CNN.COM and look under Money. They have GREAT savings tips.. great investment tips.. Go to Fidelity.com... Don't make people like THIS Rich *RICHER* in the process. Honestly... any of us can take his book.. reword a few things.. write our own book... and sell some Dreams. Its pathetic. All these GET RICH schemes are designed to get the WRITER rich, NOT YOU! When you're up late at night watching TV and see all these bogus infomercials, turn the channel... Watch Nick @ Nite, anything but the "Dream Sellers". Invest your time and money in things that you can be proud of. Do TRUE research, don't follow behind someone who's only interested in "how much money you're willing to invest in your future" AKA "are you willing to pay for the next seminar because this initial free one is replay of the infomercial you saw on tv." It's designed to get you HYPED UP.  And how do I know?  Well, I've never been to one myself, but I asked my roommate to go to one on "Our" behalf... U know, just to check it out and bring back some Great Information!  Well, "Yeah Right" is an understatement... No great info, just a repeat of the infomercial and a list of prices for the "Upcoming Events." And myself, what I've done, is ordered information about an at-home business that supposedly required "No Selling" (How unrealistic right?) Well the whole thing was, you create a website and let the website sell the product for you... but how likely is that?  I mean, of course you gotta put some effort into it and ultimately you're doing what - SELLING. So luckily I only wasted $50, but some people waste hundreds even thousands on this type of stuff... Don't but the HYPE people. Don't buy it. Just accept that everyone in life is not going to have a mercedes and a $500,00 home... but if you really want it, work hard for it. Put in the time, the effort, and the research... there are honest ways of making a good future but you have to be patient.  And again, I say, do not follow the Dream Sellers like Russ Whitney, and all the others.. unless you have a strong desire to help Them get Richer while you look on in awe 
 But the primary problem with Against Method and other books by Feyerabend is that he's really nothing more than a critic.  He doesn't appear to be that creative (most of what he tries to say was already said 50 years ago in much healthier ways by people like Max Planck).  Still, as Marx once did, he acurately identifies many of the superstitions among today's mainstream elite (i.e. our knowledge workers), but at best he, like Marx, suggests only half-hearted, not really workable solutions. At worst, as with the communist manifesto, Feyerabend hints at horrible Freedom/Liberation Theologies (i.e., South American Jesuit Priests gone wild!) and political revolutions.  Anyway, I do appreciate Feyerabend's critical work, but from all his writing it's pretty clear that HE'S OFF in his own little world. And no matter what he says or even seems to believe about himself, he surely doesn't care about anyone but himself.  He's so akin to Bob Dylan, it's laughable.  Unlike Bob Dylan, his values and beliefs are probably a good match to those of his intended academic audience: selfish and silly.  In spirit, Feyerabend and his intended academic audience are just a bunch of Freedom Theologists/Lenin's/Stanlin's/Castro's/John R. Barry's who really just want to gain power by attacking instead of strengthening the Western World's fragile Pareto boundaries.   
 As a middle school 6th grade teacher, I experience the gamut of behavoir issues from too much chatting, to rudeness to the occasional pushing/fighting.  I found myself reverting to what this book suggests you don't do (but most teachers do) and that is to constantly say "Don't" and "because I said so".  While I control out of punishment and consequences, I was not feeling I was controlling out of respect.  I was searching for a book that could help me, and came across this one.  I liked the simple concepts. I liked the actual examples used of typical classroom issues.  This book made me "think" about how I am coming across to my kids now and how I SHOULD come across.  The only part of the book that left me wondering was 'how do teachers have time to implement this'.  I wish the author could have addressed that issue more 
 I usually adore "all those Southern books" but this one is not worth it.  Just kinda stupid

 I have been a  Marge Piercy fan for years. Even if she can get a little maudlin and melodramatic at times, her heroines like VIDA and Shira in HE, SHE and IT are among the bravest and most original in contemporary literature. I took THE THIRD CHILD on a trip, eagerly looking forward to a good read from my favorite Jewish woman author. Was I disappointed. More angry than disappointed, really. A soap opera of cliches .I am used to the fact that the men in her books are users of women, conniving and untrustworthy. Sex with women is always better than sex with men.  Piercy is married, but is also a lesbian, bisexual? But here the sex is great, the man is... a murderer. This struck me as racist to the extreme. Why would Blake, the son of a convicted murderer (we never know whether he was really guilty) a good-looking and talented college student, be cast as a murderer himself? What is Ms. Piercy saying? That you can't escape your race, your heritage, your genes?And the "political" family (the father a senator who supported the execution of Blake's father) please! Maybe if it were a comedy or satire, but she's playing it straight. I don't much like Republicans either, but I know Piercy is capable of deeper, richer characters whose words and actions ring true. 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 This book just drags on and on.  Buck's search for Chloe could have been handled in a fraction of the time.  One huge gripe, which represents incredibly poor writing, is the name changes used to refer to one character.  Ken Ritz is both referred to as Ken and Ritz, and not just in dialogue either.  One rule of good writing is to ALWAYS refer to your character by one name.  You wouldn't refer to a mother as Jane, mum, mother and ma in the one book.  Still, the book can be quite entertaining if you know what's coming next, which you would because it's been mentioned enough in the books.  One more thing that bothers me is recapping on past events-- the authors rehash the same old stuff 
 Dull and pointless.  How could Jennifer Aniston read this script and think that doing this film was a good idea?  We had to turn it off about half-way through.  Shallow, boring, superficial; take your pick.  It's like a contest--which character's life sucks the most.  If you're going to depress people, at least make it interesting.  Would it have been so hard for the writers to mix in a PLOT with their nihilism 
 For the record, I have not read this book. I just finished watching a presentation of some sort of award to this author on television, followed by his views on opiate addiction and then what can only be characterized as an utterly contrived Q&A session.  That being said. Try reading the very first line, provided by Amazon.com: "Man is the only creature capable of self-destruction, and only man decides in full consciousness to do what is bad, even fatal, for him."  I am quite certain that if this line is suitable to lead the entirety of this work... it is, to a degree, and if the editor and author have half of a brain to work with, quite exemplary of the ultimate end of the piece.  Ask yourself: Can I actually, purposefully, do evil unto my self. Dalrymple asserted, in his speech this evening, that addicts are quite simply victims of bad choices and in fact have a great understanding of the possible outcomes of heroin use and addiction.  Ask yourself again: Would I, with full understanding of the nature of Heroin and the likelihood of addiction, choose Heroin? --No... no you would not. And in part the author has already contradicted him self. Not the least part of the fallacy pertains to the fact that he quotes (incorrectly, which may be a clue to his true understanding) Aristotle... who would agree with his predecessors... Plato and Socrates... in that no being willfully does damage or evil unto itself... only in mistake can a being cause harm to its self...  Now here is what I will have to assume will be the largest and most direct argument against the author. The nature of initial drug use has nearly nothing to do with understanding the facts, weighing the possible outcomes and deciding to use the drug. In fact, as any true researcher will quickly find, they reasons for drug use, the real reasons, are often quite different than the vocally expressed reasons given by the drug addicts (incarcerated) that the author had interviewed.   There is a very good chance, that under strict scrutiny, most drug addicts will have a very difficult time finding the exact reason that they began down their path. The reason for this being, that they themselves did not understand entirely why it made sense... because it didn't. There are an enormous number of reasons that a human being takes any action in any situation. the bulk of which they are never 'fully conscious.'   The author blatantly ignores the fact, in fact he asserts the opposite, that no one takes a drug thinking that they will end up and addict and ruin their life. No conscious being would be willing, let alone able, to make such a choice.   Hence, he fallaciously believes that drug use is a conscious choice in the life of a man... when in fact, it is an extreme combination of a staggering number of past events, family upbringing, social norms, cultural biases, personal accountability, accepted prejudices, level of personal thought and exploration, lifestyle and stress. Just to name a fraction.   To characterize the addict, the social user, or even the potential customer with a brush so broad as to downplay the very ability of mankind to think...(not think well... but think at all) is to convict the entirety of mankind, not just the addict, of total retardation; to characterize us all as inferior primal beings with absolutely no understanding of reason, logic and the like. Read the book... tell me if I am wrong. 
 There wasn't enough input from primary sources in this book - interviews with, and direct quotes from, family and friends - to make it antyhing resembling a definitive biography.  The details that were provided came off sounding more like heresay than fact, and there was more pop psychology in this than seemed appropriate.  The author came across as extremely knowledgeable about Grant's movies, but then got some key details wrong (as noted in detail by other reviewers) but the rest of it seemed like it was written from the outside looking in, which undermined the credibility of the book.  The photo on the front was the best part 
 The reason many of us fail to succeed is that we buy into common sense.  This book does just that by reinforcing bad practices.  It suggests that one should save and invest wisely.  There is little way in which a person could achieve significant wealth by this method though perhaps a good retirement.  The most successful people do not follow this method.  I am pretty well off myself and I can say I did not follow this method and had I, I would not be doing so well.  Unfortunately there is not a solid path to wealth (not that I know of).  Compare the wealth of Richard Branson versus Donald Trump - two very different approaches without few similarities.  My mother followed this approach and ended with just a small savings.  The story sounds appealing until you realize that it is fiction - there was no such man and that should speak for itself.  
 This book is horrible - not at all funny.  Waste of money - good thing it was relatively cheap.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone 
 I bought this and had to take it back as it did not come with any instructions on how to install it, plus there are a large number of extra parts to make it compatible with a wide range of LCD/TV's. However, how am I supposed to know which parts go with my TV? The quality of the wallmount itself seemed to be fine, but I will never know how well it would hold up because I couldn't get it installed 
 My daughter and I have played all of the previous games; we've enjoyed them overall.  Some of the games are fantastic, challenging and fun. This game was quite lame in comparison to the others.  The puzzles weren't really puzzling, just boring tasks.  There were not many clues to find.  Because there weren't many clues, there was no real sense of detecting anything.  The game ended abruptly and was very short.  We did NOT use a walk-through to solve the mystery in record time, just experienced a lack of challenge.  We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally.  The rest was pretty boring.  If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game, try one of the others instead 
 I liked it better than the Hour Game, which was so slow I never finished it.  Baldacci has unfortunately, like other authors gotten a little preachy.  They disguise it as part of the story (as if their readers don't see it) but there are whole sections that flash "Author's Message" in neon lights.  First, there are much subtler ways to send a message, second, I just don't like being preached at no matter if I agree or disagree with the message.  I stopped reading Tom Clancy (opposite view) for just this reason 
 I bought this to make meaty stews with rice for my dogs.  It works for a while then stops working, or just goes on warm.  They replaced it three times--everytime it went out.  This seems to be common with cheap rice cookers--see the reviews on the RIVAL RCS 200, they all go out within days or weeks!  I guess Black and Decker and Rival used the same Chinaman to design these useless things.  I can't understand why Amazon et al are still selling these when obviously they do NOT work.  The companies will replace them but all replacements go out immediately. In frustration I bought the Aroma 60-cupper for $125--and after two months that also went out.  Any suggestions on a 20-cup rice cooker with longevity would be appreciated 
 I found her first book fresh, new and laugh-out-loud funny perspective on the human condition.  Her "sequel" books rehash the success of the original book with a few new tales contributed by her wannabes thrown in; dull, flat, uninteresting.  I'll keep the original - I'll pass on the res 
 This series represents the second attempt to revive TZ, and is vastly inferior to its predecessor.  The series began with some built-in problems, particularly the choice of Forest Whitaker as host-narrator.  Mr. Whitaker is a fine actor, but a poor  choice to host the series, and he appears quite uncomfortable when introducing episodes, often walking around while delivering his opening lines.  After watching some of these episodes, one can understand Forest's discomfort; he probably regretted accepting the job.  Another major problem is that this series came out on UPN, which has never been (and never will be) a leader in quality programming.  Although there are some interesting story ideas, they usually fall flat in the end.  "It's Still A Good Life" is a noteworthy example.  Intended as a sequel to one of the best episodes of the original series, and featuring original cast members Cloris Leachman and Bill Mumy (with the addition of Mumy's daughter, Liliana), this episode gets off to a good start, but the plot abruptly takes a silly turn, leading to a rushed, nonsensical, and unsatisfying conclusion.  This sort of hackneyed plotting occurs throughout the series.  Talented actors simply cannot compensate for lousy writing.  This series resembles the original in name only, and even the worst of the mid-80's episodes is superior to this conglomeration of silly, poorly-written, lame stories.  The kindest thing that can be said for this set is that it is reasonably priced and nicely packaged.  Enjoy it for what it is, but, as Andy Taylor once told Gomer Pyle, "Don't over-expect."   
 If you are interested in carefully plotted, intelligent thrillers, this book is NOT for you.  James Patterson tests the limits of the reader's suspension of disbelief with his blatant tactics of manipulation.  It is too impossible to believe that a niece, a fiancee, a partner and a new lover can all become targets of one "mastermind" killer after another.  To have the killers turn out to be people that Alex Cross knows time and time again is laughable.  His sentences are no longer than 10 words and his chapters no more than 3 pages, leaving no room for character development.  I couldn't get past the first half of the book before giving up in disgust.  Take my advice, check out Michael Connelly or Karin Slaughter 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 This is not a book for the novice to learn basic self defense techniques. There are only two pictures on self defense. The rest is written. You have to already know the techniques to know what he is talking about, in which case you don't need this book. It is mostly a book about Applegate's days in the O.S.S. and how they trained. What I really don't like is the way it was falsly advertised as a book to learn the few basic techniques needed for self defense, when this is not the case at all. It is way over priced for the content 
 This book starts out strong.  It seemed like it was going to be the best Pitt novel I had read to date.  But then enters the completely unbelievable plot to save the day.  I suggest reading the first 100 pages and then moving to another book 
 Think carefully before purchasing this item. It is SO very soft, but chiropractors will tell you that softness is NOT what is needed for people who suffer from lower back problems. You sink so deeply into this thing, it is like sleeping on candy floss. After I started using it, every day i would wake up with a sore lower back, which I thought must be related to something else. Finally, in expaseration I removed the mattress topper and reverted to my old, firm Ikea mattress. The back pain was gone immediately. This foam topper really doesn't provide enough support - it 'cradles' you, indeed, but it is healthier for your spine to sleep on the firmest surface you find comfortable. And there's no point sending it back for a refund - by the time they deduct the (exorbitant) shipping fees, the 20% 'service fee', and the shipping you pay for the return, you'll have nothing left. 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 I came to this book with great anticipation. I had read its a modern American classic, a gem that is full of meaning. I thought I was in for a treat.   I worked my way through it, and wondered where, in God's name, it was going, and why I bothered reading it.   Its a huge bore, a monumental waste of time. Binx is about as dull as anyone can be, and none of the other characters are interesting. The reader goes from one boring situation to another.   Percy was trying to write about despair, and in that he was a success. The reader feels terrible despair each time another page is turned. The end of this dreadful novel cannot come quickly enough.   I realize I might well be missing what others admire. My loss, I am sure. The book failed to move me.   Its  not for everyone. I do not wish to disparage those who like it. Many regard it as great. I do not 
 There is no measure how harmful and disastrous this "sermon" has been to all who have read or heard it.  The teaching of hell or everlasting damnation (eternal torment) is a pagan teaching that has been graphed into the teachings of Christianity over 1800 years ago.  The first century church never believed in a "hell".  The theory of hell was brought in by converts to Christianity from  pagan religions of the world.  "Hell" was embraced by the political/religious leaders of the church because they saw the controlling and "converting" effect of the pagan doctrine and thus it was adopted as "orthodox" centuries after the resurrection of Christ.  Our English translations have all been used to continue this pagan teaching as fact, when it is actually fiction.  Mostly all English versions except the Concordant Literal New Testament and Young's Literal propagate this fallacy.  Do your homework.  Go to www dot what-the-hell-is-hell dot com and www dot bible-truths dot com and read up.  If you scoff then here is your challenge.  Do the research from a non-traditional, non-pagan perspective and you might find incredible things to praise God about.  Other HIGHLY recommended books are "The Inescapable Love of God" by Thomas Talbott (ISBN: 1581128312, not on Amazon, you must google it), "The Origin and History of the Doctrine of Endless Punishment" by Thomas Thayer, "The Bible Hell" by Dr. John Wesley Hanson.  Go to the sites given above and finally get a better view of what "hell" is and where it came from.  You will find answers to the many questions that arise from searching this out.  All those who scoff and stop up your ears and move on, to you I say that the real hell is the one that your doctrine creates in the minds and hearts of all who have been indoctrinated by it and your view of God that it creates.  THAT is hell indeed, and THAT is the ONLY hell that exists 
 I bought this griddle under the impression that it was non-stick - it is everything but that.  I only cook with butter (no sprays), but that does not matter.  Even with butter the eggs stick every time.  Even pancakes stick.  This is the worst grill I have ever used 
 George Benson is one the greatest guitarist of all time.  I bought this CD with the hope of hearing George Benson play the guitar with the skill and passion that most professional performers could only dream about.  George Benson did come through on two of the three purely instrumental tracks, "Softly, As In a Mountain Sunrise" and "Arizona Sunrise."  These are the only two tracks produce by Paul Brown.  The other instrumental, "Take You Out" is a tribute to Luther Vandross and is on the "Forever, For Always, For Luther" CD.  George Benson does showcase some of his talent, but he kept the song true to Luthers' rendition "Take You Out."  The bottom line is: if you think George Benson is a great vocalist, you will love this CD, and in my opinion, he is just tolerable.  Three instrumental tracks, seven vocal tracks, this CD is not "Irreplaceable."  
 I've seen the phrase "slice of life" used many times to describe this movie, which makes me wonder - whose life is this a slice of? Certainly not mine, and not most people's. The Anniversary Party is a slice of the lives of a group of people who are extremely vain, self-absorbed, jaded and rich beyond most people's wildest fits of imagination. Worse, there isn't much of a hint that the filmmakers were aware that most people, or at least most people who are fun to be around, don't act the way these characters do.   Good films can be made about Hollywood - in "Mulholland Drive" it's kind of a dream world, both in the sense that it's hazy and ambiguous and in the sense that one of its characters dreams of being a bigger part of it; in "State and Main," the self-absorption of many of the characters is offered for our amusement. "The Anniversary Party" is presented as if most viewers will be sympathetic with the characters, but I can't imagine them elicting much sympathy from anyone who isn't also a bored rich prick. If this is truly a "slice of life" for the Hollywood set, it is no wonder that so many films produced in Hollywood are so cynical and shallow.  
 "Point of No Return" is fantastic, "I Can't Wait" a little less so. Whatever happened to this band?   The two tracks above are worth the modest purchase price 
 This MAN does not understand estrogen at all. It is sad that so many women are apparently putting their health into his hands. The reason why so many women and good clinicians are avoiding products like Tri-est is because these products don't feed our bodies the necessary estrogens that our bodies actually produce from our ovaries. Giving women estriol and estrone just blocks our receptors from receiving the necessary and most important E2-estradiol. Our bodies will then metabolize the E2 into the others naturally. Research supports this aspect clearly. The other thing about this guy and his book is that he bounces everything he says off of premarin studies and does not keep the information flow consistent one way or another.  Most women getting on bio-identical hormones these days have never used premarin and want good research or clinical comparatives to support their choices with regards to bio-identicals. This book does not provide either good knowledge or research. Additionally, this book is quite disappointing for one that Amazon places so highly in their search engine.  Instead, I would recommend Wiley's book for the radical approach to understanding what it is we actually want to achieve with our bio-identicals, and Reiss's book for good information on how to monitor ourselves when using bio-identicals. However, Reiss, (another boy doctor) is also a proponent of Tri-est, probably because its just easier for him to prescribe.  Once our female clinicians have really worked out the bio-identicals that are working well for us, then we will all have great data to support our choices. In the meantime, avoid this book 
 This book is simply a collection of well known points like using top down/bottom up methodology, assertion in test process, constrained random test, etc. These points are repeated almost in every chapter and explained without solid example. Everyone who understands the importantance of efficiency & flexibility & resuability & adaptablity in verfication will be disappointed that there is no how-to in the book. 
 I loved the Little House books as a girl, and actually just read the last in the series this week.  I started with The Long Winter, and ended with this book, as I recently purchased the set of nine books for my children.    I wish that I had not read this book!  The entire book is depressing.  I feel that it spoils the lovely ending in These Happy Golden Years.  Yes, we can't help wanting to know what happens to Laura after she is married.  However, I really wish this book was published separately, as it really does not go with the set. None of her other books are depressing!  There is always happiness in the other books, even in the face of challenges.   As another reviewer stated, this book begins by re-telling the wedding proposal, but it contradicts the version in These Happy Golden Years.  Also, the overall voice of the writer is not the same as the other books.  There are also parts that are confusing, and not well written.  It is a fact that Wilder did not edit this for printing, and it is obvious that she did not intend to publish this. After only a few pages I really felt that she didn't even write it, that is how different it is 
 I wish Mr. Gore had imbibed more of a biblical foundation during his growing up years in the Bible belt.  He uses the thesis, that the only thing which creates familial bonds is luvvvvv, to then say that families come in all shapes and forms....2 daddies, or 2 mommies...ughhhhh!  It is no accident that in the book of Genesis, the creation of the familial bond is linked to the sexual act between a man and a woman. "A man shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh." In the New Testament, Paul interprets this sexually, arguing that for this reason one should not sleep with a prostitute inasmuch as you would be becoming "one flesh" with her.  So, the Gores need to repent, return to the biblical foundation, and realize that luvvvvvvvvv is not the sole nexus where familial bonds are released. It is equally in the coming together sexually of male and female.  But then, if he were to say that, he would make certain "families" feel bad. Then he would lose part of his political support. Then he would be called "bigoted" "racist" "homophobe" and "dumb."  
 Usually when someone writes a 'cookbook', it's because they have something special to share.  This book (booklet is more appropriate) is essentially worthless if you have any other barbeque book around.  I own many BBQ books and like to cross reference them to see how each makes a particular item.  This little book does not get checked, as it adds nothing to the mix.  This is not the first time I've wasted $5.95 in my lifetime.  I suggest you don't waste your money or time with this booklet.  It borders on being a ripoff 
 I was actually disappointed with this book. I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point. For me, there wasnt much suspense. Overall it kept me occupied and now I'm starting a new book 
 I was SO excited about getting this in the mail to start reading, I had just read "This Wheels on Fire" by Levon Helm (which is AMAZING) and wanted to read more about that kind of music and read a critics take on it all and well...it was awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was pretentious and cliche...all of it. I cannot understand why this book is supposed to be so great. He makes all of these assumptions about what these musicians bodies of work are really about or are supposed to represent but even to someone who was not alive during the time period, it is obvious B.S.! Marcus tries to explain that The Band's whole body of work is some sort of metaphor...that is about a "worried man"...that their work is a story that they have made up to represent their fears and their vices. If you want to know what "the weight" is about, read Levon Helm's book which is honest, touching, inspiring AND informative 
 So we just got this gift for Christmas for our 8 year old. Took me almost 10 minutes to get it to "lick." The review that mentioned rubbing hard helped. I shouldn't have to come to the reviews to figure that out. Once I got it to lick once I'm 5 minutes into trying to get it to do it again. Just WAY to much work. Not looking forward to Christmas morning and my 8 year old's almost assured disappointment 
 This book began to contradict on matter of King of kings Ismail. In one Chapter author wrote that King Ismail was a great King and was the best thing happened to Iran, the following chapter the author illustarted King Ismail as a burtail King of Iran 
 Although I do enjoy many of Charles Warren Eaton's landscapes, I found this book to contain alot of black and white reproductions of artwork and alot of text to fluff it up. The cover enticed me to purchase this book, a wonderful painting with vivid color and bold brushwork. But the interior color plates are not nearly as exciting, and too few in number 
 I so enjoyed this series and couldn't wait to get to the next book.  I read all of them in order and was so pleased to find a series and heroine I was really excited about.  What a let down.  However, I persevered, read this book and went all the way to Cerulean Sins.  Now, I understand the negative reviews and other remarks by disappointed readers and fans.  I do not mind sexual influence when it adds to the story, character, whatever.  But, this is down right ridiculous.  I mean, give me a break here.   It was one reviewers opinion that the author refuses to listen to her fans opinions, I hope that is not the case and the plots get back on track and off the current story lines. Because I miss the original Anita and her stories 
 Surprisingly sleaze and Chauvinism by female Director Heckerling! She duplicated it in Chevy Chase vehicle National Lampoon's European Vacation too! Many child actors got their start here, but the thing that cracked me up,  as I saw it when it came out (unfortu- nately) was the dialog of my fav band, Cheap Trick: Ticket scalper "...The magntism of Robin Zander and the  charisma of Rick Nielsen...and what about the tunes, 'I Want You To Want Me, The Dream Police...nan-nan-nah, 'You're momma's alright, your daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird, Surrender, surrender...", before he's  interrupted. If that isn't somebody's idea of 'Surrender', they've stumbled  onto this review by mistake 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 The Age of Access provides a thorough report on the dissonance of traditional culture in a technological sphere at the turn of the century focussing on the derivatives of capitalism from a social and economic perspective. Jeremy discusses the impact of electronic commerce on society, but omits the role of the individual in the formation of culture; he acknowledges the value of ideas and intangible assets, but disputes the commercial power of multinational corporations. The Age of Access takes the blue tack of economics and the red tack of politics and bounds them together to make them undistinguishable from each other by inadvertently encrypting the concept of capitalism and statism. The main flaw of the book is that it feeds on the readers false assumptions of capitalism. The Age of access more subliminally describes how the shift from individual rights to the violation of privacy is transforming modern life. The author does not take into account that a culture does not come up with ideas, individuals do, and that a superficial society that suppresses individualism will naturally deteriorate.  
 The present-day Pentagon budget, adjusted for inflation, is projected to be 23% over the average of the Cold War era.  By some calculations, the U.s. spends more than all other nations on defense, maintaining forces in several dozen countries (perhaps over 100).  Among current members of Congress, the percent of veterans is now lower than anytime since the end of WWII.  Bacevich goes on to assert that we have married a militaristic mindset in the 1990s with utopian ends, that this has been reaffirmed by 9/11 and the Global War on Terror, and that this does not serve our interests.  Probably true.  However, the vast bulk of "The New American Militarism" consists of Bacevich rambling about Weinberger, Powell, Abrams, etc., with little compelling documentation, quantification of impact, or common thread.  Bottom Line:  Boring 
 This book reads like a period piece, with about as much connection with current reality as a Victorian book of manners--except, of course, it is rude and abraisive.  Even in its heyday, the Manifesto was a measure of wheat in a mountain of techno-pyscho-babble, quasi-Marxian, what-we really-need-is-to-just-sit-around-and-rap chaff.  Now that the Internet is largely a tool to make customer service and contact even more difficult that before (ever try to use the "knowledge base" of most companies?) it look even quainter.  All I could think of was Webvan and the mass of uneconomic ventures that these and like fantasies spawned.  Don't bother.  Read David Ogilvy instead 
 While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as "special" or "crippled," I would never recommend it, because of the title,  which is bad as "The Nig**er Lamb" would be. Get it?  I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called "crippled" and terms like "special" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause  children to be perceived even more as "special" instead of different but equal 
 Ce-Ce Peniston was looking good&I was digging the vibe. the cat she married in the Film reminded me alot of Ronald "Mr.Biggs" Isley. I was waiting for Bro Man to start singing.this film flip flopped between the christian vibe&the sensual vibe.this film was a trip.Ce-Ce is still crazy stuffed&I likes it.but ain't alot of acting there,but oh well.this film was just ok with a couple of funny parts 
 Kudos to the 'reader' from North Brunswick NJ for his observations. Just to briefly give some detail to his comments: regarding Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith "to which every Jew must assent," no less an (Orthodox) authority than Nachmanides (the Ramban) takes issue with the 7th principle, that Moses' level of prophecy exceeds that of all others. See "Kitvei Ramban" (ed. Chavel) page 322/323, where after discussing the relative insight of Abraham, Moses and the angels, Ramban states that Mashiach will have a fuller understanding of God than them. Ralbag (Gersonides) states a similar opinion. Regarding the 8th principle, that the Torah we have today is exactly what Moses received, although the transmission process has been meticulous, there are many traditional (orthodox) sources that acknowledge that this may very likely not be the case. Tractate Soferim in the Babylonian Talmud makes references to variant readings, the Midrash in Bamidbar Rabba "describes" a visit to Ezra the scribe by Elijah the prophet where the nekudot (dots over the Masoretic Hebrew text) are characterized as signs pointing out words/letters of "questionable" authenticity. One can also mention the phenomenon of Ketiv u'Keri (words spelled one way in the Torah, yet pronounced differently) as reflecting some uncertainty in the text. Although it is a mitzvah (commandment) for one to write for himself a Torah scroll, the halacha (law) is that the scribe does not make a blessing prior to writing precisely due to the uncertainty of the text. Maimonides himself is known to have searched extensively for an "accurate" text of the Torah. His eight principle is believed to have arisen as a polemic to the masses, who were being accused by their Islamic neighbors that Jews had changed/falsified the Torah. This is an example of what he termed  "necessary opinion" as opposed to a "correct opinion." Even Rashi, who no one as of yet has accused of not being Orthodox, seems to have a version of the Torah with an extra letter "vav" that does not appear in our text in parashat Teruma. As regards the Oral Law, the very existence of Machloket (differences of opinion) among the sages suggests that, yes, while the Torah and much of what is embodied in the Talmud is of Sinaitic origin, once it was given to Man, it became vulnerable to human imperfection in the process of transmission ("Lo bashamayin Hee"  - the Torah is not in heaven 
 ... bears some examination:   Ms. Odean doesn't have children, has never had children, and is seldom seen in the presence of children. Though that doesn't disqualify her from evaluating children's literature, it does suggest some limitations.   But that's not the whole story. Ms. Odean is married to Professor Ross Cheit of Brown University. This isn't an irrelevant point; Mr. Cheit has made an academic career out of his "recovered memories" of childhood sexual abuse. (Google him and see -- it's pretty scary and controversial stuff.) He believes, essentially, that subjective, recovered memories of abuse -- for which there is no evidence but the insistence of the subjective memory of the recoverer -- should be grounds for criminal prosecution and incarceration.   The courts, as you might imagine, seldom agree. That doesn't stop Mr. Cheit from trying to accuse people in the absence of demonstrable wrong. I know from personal experience that when Mr. Cheit goes on the warpath to pursue an allegation of abuse for which there is no substantial evidence, Kathleen Odean is right there with him, cheering him on and drinking the Kool-aid. I believe she, like Ross, sees a world in which perpetrators are everywhere and are infinitely resourceful and adept at covering their tracks -- thus the very absence of evidence should be considered as proof of perpetration. While I agree that children should be taught to be cautious with strangers, I'm not sure that Ms. Odean's perspective doesn't verge on the paranoid. Her perspective isn't just cloyingly PC, as other reviewers here have complained; it's worse: there are themes of cultivated mistrust in the goodness of people and the world.   I, for one, don't think this is a healthy or helpful perspective from which to draw guidance on children's literature. Ms. Odean's world is Ross Cheit's world: full of suspicion and doubt, with perpetrators imagined everywhere, and is completely bereft of any actual experience raising her, or anybody else's, children.   Personally, I'd rather make my own decisions about my children's literature, and not invite the perspective of somebody who presents themselves as an expert -- yet around whom there are so many dark themes, sinister question marks and absence of first-hand experience of children 
 I will admit, I am a sucker for hair products. I have very thick hair, that at times, can be a little wild.  I have used Fekkai products before, and their okay.  Certainly not worth the over inflated price tag.  But I read the reviews for this product and thought it might be the perfect solution for my hair during the winter months.  Wrong answer!  This product is very thick, too thick for me to spread through my hair without putting some work into it.  Conditioners and hair masks should be well, conditioning.  I left this hair mask in the required 20 minutes, and it did nothing.  In fact, I had to go back through my hair with my $6.00 Pantene conditioner just to make my hair manageable.  I also have to wonder what the purpose is of putting pieces of nut shells into a product that is supposed to condition hair?  All those pieces are going to do is rough up your hair cuticle. Ladies, spend your money on a book that reviews hair products! I did and I've realized that ALL hair products are essentially the same.  Only the name and perfumes change.  Read Paula Begoun's book about hair products 
 This book is a royal sham - not worth your time.  There is little in this book worth reading.  For starters, Mary "Buffett" has no right to use that last name... She's no more a Buffett than your gold-digging neighbor.  The supposed formulas that she profers as belonging to Buffett in reality have little to do with Buffett's methods or his thinking - he is on record many times as refuting what she claims as his method.  What does she say about multi-disciplinary cross-examination of the investment problem set?  Nothing.  What does she say about how to define a moat and determine its durability?  Very little.  Instead we get her assumption on growth formulas...  just where did she derive that? The family Thanksgiving dinner?  Right.  Of all the books on Buffett I've read (let's just say it's well into double digits) - this is perhaps the worst...  
 I hope her knowledge of American Indian culture is sounder than her grasp of English history. I spotted some howlers, several repeated in the text: King James "VII" of Scotland (make that James VI) was NOT Queen Elizabeth's nephew. Nor was Queen Elizabeth England's first Protestant monarch (the honours go to her brother Edward VI) I could go on, but you get the idea ... Read this one with a heaping tablespoonful of sal 
 This is a wonderful idea, but is apparently before its time or the product designers didn't check with with the paper manufacturers.  It is easy to train the system to interpret bad handwriting, but accomplishing that, it is impossible to find replacement paper pads. The only replacement pads I have been able to find are steno pads and these don't have the same page/space productivity as the original paper which comes with the AceCad.  Either make replacement pads available or make the writing surface a different size to conform to writing pads that are more readily available 
 This book reads as though it was written by the staff from the television show, "The View".  Jez... 
 I think this updated version is not as clear and accurate as the 2nd. Though efforts can be seen trying to improve it and make it more attractive but, simply not as good as the 2nd edition 
 I was very excited to hear that this new Muppets Holiday offering was coming!  The previous two Christmas albums ("A Christmas Together" w/ John Denver & "A Muppet Christmas Carol") have long been family favorites at hour house in December.  However, this time I am disappointed.  Most of the songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the original puppeteers that made them famous.  I realize it is impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the puppeteers that are no longer with us.  But, to focus on these voices so much (Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Statler & Waldorf, The Swedish Chef) in this album, only produces a disappointing reminder that the "Muppets" we grew up with are long gone.  Maybe I am being a little hard on this cd.  But, there are plenty of Muppets they could have focused on for this project that are still performed in the original voices (Robin, Sam, Honeydew & Beaker, Rizzo, Louzeland, etc).  Those voices added to those of Ganzo, Miss Piggy and Fozzie would have made for a more familiar feel.  There are a couple of good cuts on the album.  One is "Merry Christmas" by Pepe.  The other is "Santa Baby" by Miss Piggy.  Sadly, over all I can not recommend this cd. 
 THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a "passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential."   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.      Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.  Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its "leveling effects."    Here's the problem with her "philosophy:"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.     Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are "deep."   In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today. 
 trully, i am from a very small town with minimal educational oppourtunities. I made my way into a very well respected graduate school without the help of a book like this.  It is understood that applying for school is stressful, but so is applying for a job or a passport. The title is very accurate.  If you took the time to study in highschool, took the time to research and think, you will do well on your exams as well as on your applications.  While a BA/BS from Harvard may look great on the wall when compared to a "public school" remember, while the BA/BS degree is important in the real world no one really cares where it came from.  I outrank a graduate from one of these ivy league schools and i graduated from a state school.  Work hard no matter where you go to your undergraduate, then apply to an ivy leagus school as a graduate student.  That is when the name matters.  Spending 45K a year on a BA/BS degree is foolish when you can spend 6K a year to go to any state school.  I have been there, i know. Freshman English lit at an ivy leagus school is the same english lit at state schools and community college.  So stop stressing, stop wasting money on books that can not get you into any school if you did not work hard in highschool, and start focusing on becomming educated.  That is the point of an education after all. This is supposed to be the best times of your life.  Dont have it ruined by being ripped off and stressed out all day long. P.S. if for some reason highschool did not agre with you start at a sommunity college.  Get real college experience and then go off to a 4 year school.  It is not and never will be hopeless if you trully want an education you can get one 
 I purchased this book about a year ago while I was 5 months pregnant with my twin boys.  Immediately I discovered that many of the views were a bit outdated.  It is very evident that it was written before twins and multiples were as common as they are now.  Many of the concerns (doctor's offices, shopping, travel) discussed are simply not an issue any more. Most pediatrician offices are very well equipped and able to handle twin visits.  Nearly all grocery stores have those awesome shopping carts with infant seats already attached (a push/pull of two carts isn't that hard).  And as far as getting around, there are literally dozens of twin and triplet strollers available now.    I found the book to consistently present the worst of every situation. From clothes, to bathing and feeding nearly all the parents seem overwhelmed and frustrated.  It really isn't like that! My boys are 7 months old now and I can honestly say... raising them has been nothing like it seemed in this book.   I say, find a more a recently written book and one that is based here in the US if you live here.  The cultural differences and new commoness of multiples really make for a big difference.    Enjoy your babies, and relax! My twin theory is this:  Whatever you just did... You just do it again. 
 While some of the fundamental dietary changes that this book suggests are very helpful to many individuals to alleviate symptoms, the alkalizing diet is nothing more than a bandaid or a temporary fix.  In a healthy individual, the body is able to properly regulate pH itself.  Furthermore, there are many  diverse underlying causes and pathways to IC, and it is my belief that every patient requires individualized treatment.  My symptoms went from mild to unbearable after several months of following Amrit's standard regimen.  I urge you to proceed with caution.    
 Carolyn Chute is well able to evoke a sense of place in which these  Northeastern hillbillies live by describing the detritus of their yards as  well as their lives.  However, the story meanders--again, not unlike the  aimless day-to-day existence of the characters she describes. Her  characterization provides the Beans and their friends and neighbors with a  rough dignity, although not enough to keep them from seeming pitiable to a  "sophisticated" urban readership 
 I love cookbooks and own thousands, but this is one of the worst I've ever seen - it seems comprised of everything I loathe in a cookbook. It contains many recipes, but no descriptions of what makes them special (and no descriptions at all).  There are often several recipes for the same dish, but nothing to signify what is different about them, which tastes best, etc.  The index sucks (very, very vague) - and 99% of the recipes are not listed in either the table of contents or the index, so the only way to find them is to scroll through the entire book.  There is a full chapter on kuchen recipes, but the word kuchen isn't anywhere in the index, nor are the recipes.  This book was a total waste!  I don't even know if the author ever tasted, much less prepared, any of the dishes - and most definitely can't understand why she was allowed to give herself five stars.  There are many wonderful breakfast cookbooks, and most (if not all) are available here on Amazon.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE 
 The music of Final Fantasy IV is something that brings back fond memories of saving the world, and so I was delighted to find that they ACTUALLY HAD a piano version of this soundtrack! And then I listened to it... and said to myself, "Hmmmmm. Nothing too exciting here." For die-hard Uematsu fans, or piano music fanatics, it isn't bad. But it doesn't capture the same magic, the same nostalgia that the original sound version does. Uematsu's other, and consequently later, piano works are very, VERY cool. FFIV is something you'll never catch me requesting to hear 
       !!!!!!!!!!DONT BUY!!!!  NUFF SAI 
 This book is one of the funniest I have ever read because it is truly "Progressive liberalism". Absolutely nothing new. Bash, bash, bash Conservatives. Use of hate speech, which liberals go crazy over if it is use against one of their sacred cows. Trying and trying to rewrite the Constitution, something they have never studied or learned what the framing fathers thought when they wrote it.      I offer no excuse for George W. who is no conservative, but if liberals offer no more than this which they don't, Republican's will keep getting elected. I like most Conservative's long for another true Reagan 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book, with it's constant reviewing of past events just made me more sad than inspired to create art.   I am a painter, not a writer...so forcing myself to write all of the time just wasted valuable practice time. ( I also work full time and have a busy spouse that I like to spend time with) so every precious second that i can spend on my art I grab up.   I guess, for pepole who are in emotional distress, this book can teach you how to use art as a thereputic tool for recovery and self esteem. That is fine. For busy, self motivated artists who already enjoy making art...this book isn't going to deliver those fun moments of "get-up-off-your-behind" inspiration. For an energetic, get moving to make art book, read Danny Gregory's "the creative licence" instead.   In conclusion, this book has a lot to offer pepole who have had a troubled past and are working through a lot of anger and sadness, but that wasn't me. I just wanted to make art 
 The movie on the second disc is billed as the original theatrical release. This is only partly true. It was shown in 1977, but this was after it was cut to a commercial length. I am not a die hard purist, so don't get this wrong. However, the movie I loved was the one that existed prior to the commercial cut late in 1977. The moments with the character "Biggs" is an important part of the story, now lost. It supports Lukes longing to leave, but it also shows his longing for someone to look up to. Without these scenes this simply isn't the movie I loved-the initial release of Star Wars before it was cut to commercial length. I guess George Lucas just doesn't care about those of us who cherished the first release, which sadly now no longer exists for those who desire to see it. Shame on you Mr. Lucas!!   Moral: Don't waste your money 
 i used to be a rather large 311 fan due mainly to the comparisons to sublime. they are pretty good in my book but i must say, this cd is a weak compilation...one has to understand..each of the albums represents a different 311 universe. being reduced to 2-4 songs off of each album mushed together on one gets old very fast.  start out with transistor or soundsystem if your into reggae-ish sounds..if your into rap rock..go with grassroots and blue album. this cd is a rip off and a cheapened 311 experience 
 I ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails! Stay away not recommended 
 This movie is extremely boring. This definitely qualifies as one of the worst movie in my list aside from 'The Dukes of Hazards' ( Simpson, & J.Knoxville)and 'The Avengers' (Sean Connery). If you want to bore yourself to death, this would be perfect for you.... The actors were quite talented (Robert Doney Jr., Heather Graham), but the story is pretty shallow...The actors remained in the house the whole time, and it was pure dialogues/arguments about cheating 
 Don't waste your time or money on this book.  It was about as interesting as watching paint dry!  Maybe Danielle Steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out 
 I really liked the movie "the Hours", loosely based on this book, so I thought I'd read it... I couldn't get through it.  I love many classic books, but I'll not try another by Virginia Woolf 
 I had what is like an allergic reaction to this book. I have this fear that if I don't say something this might be mistaken for a great novel... there is no great poetry here; just fascination with death and death. My reaction was like litmus paper: this is a disgustingly self centered book about: 1) suicide 2) homosexuality 3) " painfully susceptible sensibilities" " Virgina Woolf put a stone into the pocket of her coat , walked into a river and drowned." Over and over and over... It makes you afraid of reading Virginia Woolf. Well, the book made me want to read Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf anyway 
 This book was assigned school reading.  I found it rather boring and the language used in the story became annoying after a while.  Not recommended 
 This is a very dissapointing DVD. If they allowed you to have songs without commentary interruption it might be ok, or if there was any 'previously unreleased' music on it. Even if they just had the pictures, film and diary entries with the music it would be ok. But there's no reason to watch this DVD more than once if you have to listen to all the commentary each time. The Band of Gypsy DVD has two options, Concert Footage only and Concert Footage with Commentary. Jimi's music speaks for itself, and no one can come close to him, so it's not necessary to hear what people have to say about him. The music and maybe the pictures as background are enough 
 The companion web site mentioned in the book is not there. When I typed in that URL, I got redirected to Peachpit's advertising site of this book, but no "links", "tools", nor "examples" mentioned in the book at all! 
 I really don't know where to begin what was wrong with this stink fest. I was ready to quit watching the movie, and almost did, after the first ten minutes. Besides the crappy acting and the false and really bad British accents, the movie has a bad plot that is very predictable to every horror movie fan. They give into every cliche and stereotype a horror movie can have. I knew everything that was going to happen before it did. I really don't know what's worse, this or  House of the Dead. At least House of the Dead is so bad it's funny, this is just sad. The movie is definitely not scary, I know what you did last summer is even scarier. Overall, once again, B. Lizard has managed to disappoint me.  
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 As a general practitioner, I don't recommend this book for professionals who want to improve in advanced knowledge in physiology. It is a STARTER book on the theme, for medical students only, not for practicising doctors.  I've got frustrated 
 I admit it, I only read the book because the title angered me so much. The contents, on the other hand, frighten me. For starters, as a bipolar person, it was obvious to me that Curtiss' problem is not "depression" but bipolar disorder, and that she wrote the book in a state of hypomania. Her history of manic and depressive episodes is so clear--and so is the havoc and hurt her behavior caused the people around her. That she thinks psychiatry and meds are a cop-out only shows how deep her denial is.  Second, the idea that mental illness is somehow the person's fault is fraudulent and injurious in the extreme. If Curtiss had approached a publisher with a manuscript entitled "Epilepsy Is a Choice," do you think it would've gotten published? Well, mental illness is a physical disease of the brain, just like epilepsy. Saying the effects of the illness are the patient's fault makes as much sense as saying diabetics only have high blood sugar because they just don't have enough willpower.  There is a difference between the kind of depression most everybody goes through in life--over the death of a loved one, say--and a clinical mental illness. If you have a mental illness, the ONLY choice is to GET YOUR BUTT ON MEDS AND STAY THERE! Unless, that is, you want to wreck your own and other people's lives, as Curtiss clearly documents she did--and still is doing, if she causes ill people to not seek treatment and blame themselves for their illness. What a shonda 
 'Gin' Sanders gives some good advice in this book but there is also alot of fluff and just plain nonsense about why one should eat healthy. For instance she continually writes about how certain foods and ways of eating are 'tacky'. While that may be true, real data on the health benefits of the French diet is probably more helpful than being judgemental. I would recommend Clower's The Fat Fallacy over this. 
 This book would have been a waste of time even if it had been free.   It doesn't answer the question in its title as it has no answers it is only a book of questions . . . what if this, what if that, what if . . .?   I might as well have been spending the weekend with by sister and brother-inlaw and their 2 year old who only asks why this, why that, why, why, why?   It was a poorly thought out book that has managed to sucker in thousands of buyers 
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clichï¿½d rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
 The Cobra Event is a jarring book, not because of the plausibility of the plot nor because it goes into excruciating pains to describe dead boies and their subsequent autopsies, but because there are so many errors on its pages. Worse, there are whole chapters devoted to nothing that advances the plot or helps me undersatand the story better; pages and pages of filler - it was like reading a doughnut.  Among the worst are:  --Changing verb tenses in the middle of a paragraph. I have no idea why a paragraph that starts with the past perfect tense suddenly switches to the present tense in the second sentence. And it didn't happen just once.  --Using "you" all the time. The book has this very condescending, accusatory tone when it directly addresses me, as though it knows what I know and don't know.  --Maxing out the filler potential. I know that detail helps to make stories seem authentic, but really, taking a paragraph to explain the history of Katz's Delicatessan is superfluous.  Argh 
 Perhaps I'd put too much stock in all the praise I'd seen heaped on Charles McCarry and this book. What a great espionage writer he is, the party line went. Our Le Carré, etc., etc. But this book, which I purchased at full price in hardcover, was so dull and disappointing that I gave up in anger and disinterest not even half way through. McCarry probably has been as good as his admirers say, but in this book, he seems to have switched on the auto-pilot, taken the money, and run. I quickly grew tired of all his fancy brand names - dropped, it appears, as a way to suggest authenticity and insider knowledge - and all the exotic locales he pushes his characters to, as if scouting locations for a movie. I have not given up; I will now try his earlier books, starting with 'Tears of Autumn,' and keep my fingers crossed. I remain hopeful 
 I saw a few scenes and couldn't even continue watching.  I like a lot of Charles Bronson's movies.  Examples include "Death Hunt," the 80s "Death Wish" series, and "the White Buffalo."  But his acting in this movie is unrealistic.  He does not act like a real Apache.  Bronson seems to overdo it on being "stoic."  A relative and I watched a few scenes and just switched channels.  Bronson is out of his element in trying to portray a real Apache.  Paul Newman does a much more realistic job when he portrays an Apache-raised white man in "Hombre," which I purchased on Amazon.  I do applaud Bronson in trying to portray a movie more sympathetic to the plight of the Apaches trying to avoid reservation confinement in the 1880s.  Given the time period, perhaps Bronson should have hired Roman Gabriel instead.  He does a realistic job of portraying a Cherokee Indian in the "Undefeated," which was also released around the same time (give or take a couple of years) 
 The Tesseract (Oxide Pang, 2003)  I hereby forgive Danny Boyle for taking Alex Garland's amazing novel The Beach and turning it into the piece of celluloid excrement that it became. The problem seems to be that Alex Garland's novels have a pathological fear of being turned into movies, because unlike The Beach, The Tesseract comes with a director (The Eye's Oxide Pang) and male lead (b.Monkey's Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) who are absolutely above reproach and can simply do no wrong, and the movie's still... eh.  (I hereby thank all things holy that Garland's excellent screenplay for 28 Days Later... was not, in fact, based on one of his novels.)  The Tesseract is an interesting premise; the lives of four people (a drug runner, a psychologist, a bellboy, and an injured assassin) intersect in various ways in a disreputable Bangkok hotel. You know that Pang (who also directed the above-average action flick Bangkok Dangerous) is going to be able to do wonderful things with his home turf, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers could make reading Harlot's Ghost worth watching. Add in Saskia Reeves (Dune) and you've got a recipe for a blockbuster. Problem is, it never quite gels.  Pang, as expected, does in fact do wonderful things. (His use of repeated scenes from different angels to track the deeply confusing time element in the story is wonderful.) Rhys-Meyers, though he gets surprisingly little screen time for a male lead, acts as well as he always does. Saskia Reeves, who actually gets the most screen time (along with bellboy Wit, played by newcomer Alexander Rendell), also does a good job, although her part's not as well-written as is Rhys-Meyers' or Rendell's. The action is relatively fast, the camerawork is superb. So what's wrong with it?  I can't really tell you. It's the same indefinable thing (I refuse to blame Leo DiCaprio, who does have a good actor hiding in there somewhere, viz. The Basketball Diaries and What's Eating Gilbert Grape?) that made The Beach into such a crapfest. I cannot urge you strongly enough to read Alex Garland's novels; I urge you with equal fervor to avoid the movies based on them. * 
 Just received the German 4 disc digipak. GOOD NEWS. played 10 mins of both - no problems. Menus are all in English (or German) all the extra's on the English R2 SE's are here except for the photo gallery.  The sound is very good and the restored english mono is BETTER than the MGM 5.1 also on here with the commentary and German mono. The 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation.  Picture. No problems I could see on my 6ft screen via InFocus 5700 projector from an Arcam FMJ-DV29 DVD player. Player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything.  Only watched first 10mins of each but doing A-B comparisons with the English R2 MGM SE's the German ones are noticeably better, they look less washed out, contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on Fistful, which is why I bought this set, but also on Few Dollars More as well.  They are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly Few Dollars More is at last the full version, which no MGM DVD is worldwide..... 
 I purchased two of these and the metal is flimsy.  Both "boxes" are warped and don't sit squarely on the counter (wobble).  There's nothing I like about them!  One was missing a plastic edge piece on the door. VERY DISAPPOINTING 
 Count me among those who miss the original William Lashner. While this book kind of pulls you through it by the nose, if for no other reason than to find out what happened to Chantal Adair, it turns out to be a rather dull conclusion. Not too many of the characters have any authenticity to them and the plot turns and twists turn out to be more tedious than energizing.   The book jacket says "It takes a deeply flawed lawyer to solve a perfect crime."  Victor Carl certainly qualiifies as deeply flawed. The crime, while unsloved however, is far from perfect. Worse than that, it isn't even very interesting.  I'm afraid this is a non-starter 
 Bruce brings feeling like he means it to "Chimes of Freedom." Feeling behind those words produces great power.  The rest of the disc is waste 
 I gave 2 star for this CD not because of the musical quality...but because the last song "Goodnight My Love" is cut short on this CD. After watching the live performance on cable, I rushed out to buy this CD, labeled by Hybrid. Only to find out my favorite song "Goodnight My Love" was cut short. On the CD, it ends with  the sax doing a solo then fades away....which leaves the song dangling and unfinished!!!   On the video, this song ends with Art singing "bring you closer to me" and the music slowly ends beautifully, correctly. There's a version out which was released by Sony in 2003. I don't know if this version contains the full song. The Hybrid Label version is simply ridiculous!!!  How can you possibly end such a beautiful song short!! leaving it unfinished....and well....SHORT and listeners wanting more!!!  If someone can verify if the Sony conatins the full "Goodnight My Love"...or tell me where I can get this verson,  would really appreciate it 
 I found most of the information in Smith's book to be outdated and no longer useful.  A much better choice is "Guide to Careers in Federal Law Enforcement," by Thomas H. Ackerman, which is by far the best book  ever written on the subject.  Also, a good resource for background  information is "Handbook of Federal Police and Investigative  Agencies," by Donald A.

 Although this book would appear to have a lot of promise, it ultimately fails. Like Mr. Taylor's self-proclaimed "Certified Professional Landlord" title (Fill in your name on page 218 for your own bogus certification!), these phony forms are imaginative but have little to no legal standing. Worse, Taylor apparently has little respect for his tenants. One form, the "Tenant Late Rent Warning and Excuses" form ("To be given to new, renewing, and late tenants.") asks tenants to mark a box as to why their rent was late. Sample excuses: I was mugged. "You didn't come by when I had the money," "I didn't have a stamp," "I'm dead." A chuckle for a landlord, but also a cynical and unprofessional suggestion. Taylor's advice on handling phone calls from prospective residents is even worse - he promotes using a hard-sell interrogation on the first contact that seems destined to drive away prospective tenants. Anyone with intentions to do good business would be well served to get more professional advice than this extremely disappointing book 
 Having read this book, as well as Ravi Batra's "Crash of the Millenium" and James Dale Davidson's "The Sovereign Individual", I can't help but point out that these are the same people that were telling us to expect a U.S.economic/financial market collapse throughout the '90s(see: "Blood in the Streets" and "The Great Reckoning" by Davidson/Rees-Mogg, "The Great Depression of 1990" by Batra, and Prechter's newsletters/special reports from that period). Obviously, they turned out to be just a tad off the mark. After a peruse of this material, have a look at one of Harry Dent's books for a look at the baby boom spending wave that continues through the latter half of this decade (Dent points out on his website that the current economic dip we are in is similar to the one that took place between 1920-1922, before the Roaring 20's market took off). The only way that the kind of boom the Spending Wave projects can ever take place would be if the majority are looking in the wrong direction. Material such as this book from Prechter, as well as Batra and Davidson, will do very nicely 
  So they invented drum'n'bass. They define it as being Bossa Nova with a new beat. I tell you it's nothing at all. I think they could add new material to it if they really wanted to create something new.  What's wrong here is to find that this is a new way of playing and feeling Bossa Nova. No, not absolutely, this is not Bossa Nova.  Repertoire is good Brazilian music. Voice is fine crystal.  Unfortunately this 'drum'n'bass' ensemble is just a passing wave.  Ms. Gilberto owes us something better 
 Oh, man, this is rough. The debut was OK, the second was middling sophomore slump, and now, this third one is just ghastly - a real mess and a total letdown. What glimmer of talent on display on the first record has been replaced by flat, tuneless, and totally bland riffs in search of song structure and hooks that never come. Did you see the lead singer try to "sing" on SNL?  Sadly, he looks cool in his para-military peacoat and touseled rockstar hair, but the guy cannot carry a tune, for real. Out of key yelping is a understatement. Just painful to listen to.  Why bother?  Make this CD a coaster 
 I quit reading this book after 225 pages. Like most of the books I give 2 stars, I'm going to leave that one statement as a major testament to what this book did for me. I don't know if it's fair or not. I'm sure scores of Bloom fans will say I'm too ignorant to understand it. Maybe I am. But the purpose of writing a review is to be consistent in rating the books I read. I find the lack of lower ratings on many books puzzling. If you read a book and it isn't to your liking, you should say so. For me, this was of very little interest, and just wasn't a very good book.  I found the commentary about Adam and Eve to be the most interesting part of the book. Everything else, including the Book of J itself, was hard to take. The introductory piece before the translation was downright painful, and the only thing that got me through it was the notion that the actual book couldn't be much worse. I was right, that it couldn't be much worse. But it wasn't really any better either. For me, these stories are too transitory and scattered to be of much interest.  The commentary starts off well, but then sinks into an almost desperate attempt to declare that J is a) a woman, b) the main influence of Shakespeare, and c) the main influence of many classic Western voices (Tolstoy/Freud/Kafka/etc). After 225 pages, I got so sick of hearing this assertion that I quit the book and stared out the train window for the next 45 minutes. The total lack of focus and drove me bonkers.  I think scholars of the subject might enjoy the book, but casual fans of literary works will have a tough time with it. As a reference, I have read Michener's Source, and recently Rushdie's Satanic Verses. Both are steeped in religion, and both held my interest for many pages, the latter more than either. But this book, well, it was very difficult for me to keep at. Those who don't already have a working knowledge of the subject matter are going to struggle with this.  It's not necessarily that I think this book is lousy. It's just impossible for me to really identify with. And in that sphere of existence, the one I live in, it's a 2 star book, simply because I would rather watch the buildings, cars, and grass go by the train window than read it any further. Take it for what it's worth, but that was my experience.  Not for the casual reader 
 I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money! 
 This is not a biography but rather a discussion of each of Hitchcock's films. For each film there is: - Detailed synopsis - Cast and Crew details - Analysis of the film  These first two of these items can be obtained from the Internet for free and who really wants to know the details of the story anyway? The analysis of each film is largely a waste of time as Spoto tends to over-analyse each film to the point of distraction while offering no real insights.  If you want to find out more about Hitchcock's films I would recommend McGilligan's excellent biography. This discusses each film in the context of Hitchcock's life and career and is far more illuminating 
 With all of the hype surrounding the talented Jack White (and some of the other musicians in the Racontuers), you would expect a solid album from this side project......unfortunately, the album does not deliver.  No one song sticks out for me as anything special.....the band just does not seem to have the same stripped-down, raw, bluesy feeling of the Stripes.  Bottom line, this is a side project that will not likely succeed.  N.B. - I saw these guys play live at the 2006 Virgin Fest near Baltimore, MD.....they were disapointing.  However, another band that played Virgin Fest, Wolfmother, got the crowd into it and played a hard, driving, and deep set.  
 I bought this CD, and I ended up throwing it in the bin the very next day. I bought it and I'm a bit of a ghost freak and I saw the song "Banshee," I put the record in and skimmed over to listen to it. I couldn't move I was white with terror. Henry Cowell is a good composer and all, but his songs are petrifying. I went over to my friends house and told him about the CD. He told me to bring it over. As I put the CD in the player. My friends 5-year-old sister came in and Screech went the song and as if the song were a magical spell, Alakazam! The sister went screaming with terror crying all the way up the stairs and daren't come back down until it was established that I had left the house, which I did immediately. I don't think anyone should waste their money on this. It is an unsuitable collection of screech, screech, ooo, I hate that sound 
 I bought these because they cost less than Uggs. But there is no comparison. My old Uggs ruled, were totally comfy and warm. I bought these because I didn't have the money for Uggs and they said they were "sheepskin". When I recieved them they looked and felt different. The fur was not "curly and fluffy" like the Uggs, it was relatively short and not as soft. I called Bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic. But after several calls the owner told me " they are not 100% sheepskin, they are blended with merino wool" which is NOT stated anywhere on Amazon or their website. Also I am a designer/ decorator and I am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and I still say they're synthetic. I returned them, at my cost, and am waiting for a refund. You get what you pay for! I probably could have bought a better pair at Payless. What happened next: They promised me they would refund my money if I returned the boots at my cost, instead they sent them back to me with no refund. Nice 
 The summer of 1999, aged 15, was the day I felt my innocence shattered. I had so greatly been looking forward to this film and was so excited to have a Star Wars I could call my own (as in made in my generation) only to find out that it was a piece of garbage full of bad/flat, lifeless acting, a story full of plotholes and inconsistencies with the original trilogy and enough CGI to make your eyes bleed.  The actors, including heavy weights like Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson, up and comers Natalie Portman, and gradually progressing into leading man status Ewan McGregor, are all wasted here. Neeson, McGregor and Jackson are OK but OK is all they are, but they don't stand out at all, nor does Portman. All I can say of Jake Lloyd is that he looks like he's having fun. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, ARGH. What was Lucas thinking? And poor Darth Maul got killed before we had a chance to get to know him.  But what's most offensive of all, aside from the lifeless/passionless acting, are the continuity errors. All these years we were led to believe that Obi-Wan (McGregor) risked a lot to make Anakin a Jedi Knight, but here Obi-Wan's little more than a 2nd banana lurking in the background, while Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) is at the front line doing what he can to get Anakin ahead, and it's just wrong. That was what hurt me the most, the fact that the film wasn't about Obi-Wan, that it didn't adhere to previous Star Wars history.  And Episode 2, alas, isn't that big of an improvement 
 My mother gave us our Rival F69204 Electric White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer, which worked well for three seasons.  Yesterday, I made a batch of frozen custard for company for dinner.  The result was terribly salty and had to be thrown out.  I filled the stainless steel container with water, which seeped out overnight.  Apparently ice cream salt bled into the custard mix while the ice cream was making.  Online, I discovered (1) that Mother paid much too much for this item and (2) there seemed no way to order replacement parts--as in a new tank.  Can you help 
 I'm a yoga instructor who was very disappointed in this CD as far as it being a music to practice to.  The music for me felt all wrong for my own practice - the sequencing, the pace of the music, the song selection by Windam House.  It felt more like easy listening music, but not quite right for a yoga practice (even a slow flow practice). For me, the music has to fade into the back ground while I'm practicing - this just grates on my nerves.  My classes didn't care for the music and complained that the music was distracting for them as well.  I recommend Planet Yoga (both CD's are wonderful- Disc 1 for faster paced and Disc 2 for meditation or slow flow) and Yoga Rhythm.    However, for just playing at home while cleaning, or just relaxing it's alright. I don't think it's anything to get excited over. 
 I forgot how silly the songs of this era were. I used to have a big crush on Tennille... what was I thinking?  Album was not worth it... I play my crickets and surf environmental sound disc more than this one... YUCK  
 Like all the Haynes T-shirts except the 50/50, these bunch at the back of the neck. Try another brand 
 This book looked like it may be pretty funny to read, but unfortunately it was not.  I generally try to be kind in my reviews but I found this book to be so nauseating that I just had to write a negative review.  Mr.Stuever may be a talented writer technically, but the content of his articles is pretty pathetic.  He spends so much of his time being critical of others, that it leads me to wonder why he feels it is necessary to degrade others to help his own cause.  If you enjoy reading articles that are a constant derision and mockery of others, then this is the book for you.  If not, there are plenty of other funny reads out there.    
 Basic concepts but a good read for those under heavy-handed leadership 
 I gave this book 100 pages of my time - 8 full chapters. I could not get into this story, though I did try. It didn't hold my attention at all. The plot goes nowhere. I won't be finishing this one. This was my first Carla Neggers book and I'm disappointed. I have one more book of hers to try. I hope it's better than this one. If not I won't be reading any more by this author. 
 Modern creation theories are proving that an infinite God is the origination of our finite universe.  The consequence is that there is no celestial world.  Instead, God empowers and enlightens our world directly through a holistic spiritual atomic system.  Some of these atoms are human mind/souls.  Since the creation only contains wholes, mind/souls-bodies relations are never lost, making reincarnation a natural process.  So, channelling and paranormal sources must be questioned. 
 I returned this contract and asked for a refund but NEW ignored my first two emails. Then I called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take 8 weeks to refund my account. I then contacted Amazon and they resolved the matter in one day. I read reviews for NEW and most people that actually had to deal with NEW were not happy. The 77% positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product.  
 Do not buy this CD, it's terrible.  One of the biggest mistakes I ever made is buying this CD...it is now a coaster 
 I really wish Amazon would let you chose from negative numbers when it comes to rating stars. This movie is nothing but anti-gun propaganda. I have gotten up and walked out of better movies than this, but it was like watching a train wreck...I just had to stay for the end. You know, for those of you who don't know...firearms SAVE far more innocent lives than they take every year, and mine was one of them. This movie CD might make a good coaster, but beyond that it is trash.  Some less than truthful "NRA member" (yeah right) wrote..."I really liked and enjoyed this movie. The acting was excellent and the plot twists and action kept my attention. It will keep yours too, just give it a chance. Sure, it was a little bit slanted against the gun industry, but they deserve it and need to be more responsible. I may buy the DVD to watch it again, but am overwhelmed with the movies I have bought from amazon.com and not gotten around to watching. However, I may add this to my collection!"  HORSE HOCKEY. Member of the NRA? More like member of the Micheal Moore fan club. This was the WORST movie I have ever seen. They even had to LIE to get you in the theater, as nothing was mentioned about it being anti-gun in the trailers! And saying that it was "a little bit slanted" is like saying Micheal Moore is skinny and has never ate a cheeseburger or told a lie!! 
 I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE 
 I liked this book in the end but it took me awhile to warm up to the two people in the story.  The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk.  I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding.  He was kind of shallow.  But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk.  I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them.  I have read better chicklit 
 The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.  This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.  Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer.  
 I was forced to listen to this band because everytime I got into a friend's car that loved this band had it blasting in his car.  I couldn't stand that ridiculous voice from the lead singer and the band's wacked sound.  Don't get me wrong here.  I'm not a hater, I love all type of music, from rock, rap, metal, new wave, pop, jazz, freesyle, opera, classical, country, R&B, blue grass, gospel, nu metal, industrial, techno, to the homeless guy on the boardwalk beating on pots and pans for a nickel.  I LOVE music.  But....WHAT THE HELL DO YOU FIND IN THIS BAND?????  THEY SUCKED!!!!  BAD....LY! 
 As other reviewers have pointed out, this book presents the Israeli side only.  There are only two pictures of Arab aircraft and in both cases they are shown being shot down.  I felt duped by buying this book (it was shrink wrapped in the store), so I wrote to Osprey about how bad it was.  They were sympathetic to my dislike of the book 
 "Sugar" is an interesting name for this strange, awkward, ultimately disappointing film starring a couple exceptionally compelling leads.  While they carry the film over it's editing, direction, and story hurdles, they can't make up for its unevenness.  Plus the story is entirely too cliche, and I couldn't help thinking it was essentially the same story as "Circuit," albeit in a different venue (except I enjoyed Circuit.)  I couldn't get into this film.  Why not?  The story lurches around and you are left to wonder "why" and "how" altogether too much as things go from awkward to worse.  Something in the description of this film claims it's funny.  I guess if you think drug addiction and prostitution and life on the streets are funny, then you will get a good laugh out of this.  I kept hoping that something would happen and my time investment on this film would be worthwhile.  Not so much.  I'd recommend "Circuit" to anybody who might enjoy the falling-for-the-hustler and can-the-hustler-really-love story lines, and I'd leave this film on the shelf.  It's redeeeming qualities are few 
 Anyone hoping to encounter the same unflinching brilliance found in "Everything is Illuminated" will be sorely disappointed.  The narrative is tedious, overindulgent, and, at times, utter nonsense.  Maybe that was the point, in trying to make sense out of something senseless, the 9/11 attacks, but the book, all of its seemingly infinite arrangement of words and more words, fails miserably.  I can't help but wonder what a gifted and brave editor could have made of this book.  As it is, it's length and self indulgence made me not trust the narrative about midway through the book.  It became obvious to me that Foer is enraptured with his own method of storytelling, and thereby has no sense of when to leave a point that has been made, or excise a character that is superfluous.  Instead, it gets belabored, drawn out to the point where you feel as if he's chasing the horizon.  Which, of course, just retreats at the same pace at which you pursue 
 I was so excited when I ordered my Star Wars Holographic Emperor figure. I'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks!! When I got home today, the box with the Amazon logo was on my doorstep. Upon opening the box, I was completely disappointed to find that the Emperor figure I'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed. The people packing this stuff are half-wits!! Anybody with a brain would know better than to  cram something into a box like that!! They should be ashamed of their service & to all you collectors out there....BEWARE!! 
 The movie was ok, but kind of confusing at times and too long. The time travel was interesting, especially when the Bandits ended up on a sinking Titanic 
 This is not "Follies in Concert," it is the reader's digest version.  Many numbers have been truncated and many omitted, most notably "Waiting for the Boys Upstairs" and "The Road I Didn't Take."  While the concert itself ran over 130 minutes, the DVD is made from a 90 minute video tape.  Include the fact that they added about 30 minutes of rehearsal interviews, and the concert is basically cut in half.  In addition, the DVD is video tape quality and the sound is unstable.  All in all, a very disappointing recording for Sondheim lovers 
 This is not for beginners. I found it to be be very difficult for a first time user like myself. I think for the most part eveything is explained very well. Sometimes I had a hard time follwing certain poses 
 Blue Velvet, adored by all gothics, S&M enthusiasts, and geeky, self-described (i.e., uneducated) 'film buffs,' leaves you with the same exasperation and puzzlement endemic to David Lynch films.  Proponents of Blue Velvet will tell you that it explores the 'dark side' of everyday life, what mainstream America doesn't really want to address...don't buy into it.  Lynch's vision cannot stand in for anything that most of us will ever experience, and its absurd exaggerations drive the point home.  Perhaps the problem is watching this movie with twenty years worth of perspective, or maybe it was always this mediocre; whatever the case, Dennis Hopper is more overdramatic than scary, and (again, as is the m.o. of Lynch) the plot is hardly satisfying.  The characters make irrational choices, with absolutely no explanation (why does Laura Dern suddenly forget that her new boyfriend has been sleeping with the psychotic woman they have been watching?).  The final scene is particularly troubling...not because it 'shakes the foundations of cinema and everyday life,' but because it plays out without any coherence (the shady detective standing in the apartment, with no explanation for why he is suddenly immobile?).   If you've seen Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway, you will not be surprised by the seemingly arbitrary confusion Lynch too often indulges.  Whereas other experimental filmmakers seem to have a point to make with their choices, one has the feeling that Lynch instead constructs a pseudo-mystery without bothering to let the audience ever understand.  In all fairness, at the time of Blue Velvet Lynch had not yet reached the stage of simply throwing unconnected and unexplained plot twists into his film; still, most viewers will be left wondering what the hell they just watched, and why it has been canonized in American cult-cinema.     
 Too much instrruction on what a raga ia and the different types.  I really don't care about that.   I just wanterd music 
 The Butcher (Edward Gorsuch, 2006)  And here we have, yes, another young-and-beautifuls-go-to-an-old-scary-house-and-get-massacred movie. Bad acting. Increasingly-common variation on old horror movie rule (instead of straight kids having sex, there's a pair of lesbians, who must, of course, suffer gruesome ends-- this isn't a spoiler, as the first occurs in the extended opening scene. So the lesbian must die even before they encounter the guy who does the massacring. Silly, anyone?). Awful, awful script. Incredibly predictable plot twist. Yeah, there's really nothing good to say about this movie. Some wag on the IMDB boards called it (forgive my paraphrasing) a bad remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre combined with a bad remake of The People Under the Stairs, and he's right.  
 This movie is the most boring, uninteresting piece of garbage I have ever wasted my money on. The plot is stupid, the characters are dull and insipid, and the whole movie leaves you asking, as the credits run, "So What?" Don't waste your money! 
 Nothing like EON. EON is the one. This was a hack sequel with no guts. Very dissapointing 
 Satan is a one-trick pony... he mixes lies with truth.  The Bible calls him the Father of Lies.   And if he really exists and has been around for as along as he has... he must be pretty darn good at it by now.  Yes its true that Jesus is the Son of God, everything else in this fairy tale is a convenient "fact".  Anyone can just throw "facts" out there but I challenge this author to provide as much fact as Lee Strobel does in "A Case for Christ".  "But if you give them a hard time, bullying or taking advantage of their (Christians) simple trust, you'll soon wish you hadn't. You'd be better off dropped in the middle of the lake with a millstone around your neck."  I'll give you three guesses who said that.  
 This book is obviously not for the average reader. I read it for a psychological anthropology book review and found myself regretting every moment of it. First of all, Linde tries to give to many examples and  restates the same thing over and over. When I finished chapter 8 and read  the conclusion which was four pages I was a little upset. The whole book  was a waste of time, by just reading the conclusion the few points that  were made are clearly stated there without the non-sense and all the  repetition. INSOMNIACS this is a must buy for you it put me to sleep about  7-8 times. Besides that avoid this book if at all possible. You can thank  me for the sacrafice I made for you 
 On the front page The Times is quoted to have written: "Extremely funny!". I didn't have one laugh. Not even a smile. I think that says it all. Let me add that the writing is not bad, but the main theme of the book is almost stupid, sometimes disgusting and certainly boring. And the story contrived and exaggerated. The background story of the Ukrainian family having suffered through the Stalin's regime and WWII concentration camps is more interesting, but is too sporadic to improve the overall impression 
 I read through this book and found it fairly hard to digest. It seems too "academic" for me. An amateur like me probably won't be able to get anything meaningful out of it 
 I generally like the Lonely Planet Guides and have used them in many countries.  This particular guide became a running joke.  It is difficult to get a bad meal in Japan, but the worst meals we had were at places recommended in the Guide.  If the Guide recommends a restaurant, I would stay away.  Just use the maps to wander around a neighborhood, look at the food in the windows, find something that looks good and you will enjoy your trip much more than if you depended on this book for culinary recommendations 
 Shaw, who more than any of his contemporaries dealt provocatively with the crucial issues of his day, has not worn well.  In a 1971 encyclopaedia I had as a child, the entry on GBS called him the greatest dramatist since  Shakespeare.  That's better than Moliere, Sheridan, Strindberg, Ibsen,  Wilde, Jarry, Chekhov, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett!  Such a laughable  proposition is untenable today, and we can now see Shaw for what he is - a  superficially amusing farceur, who squandered this modest gift on deadly  social comment, deadly because he reduced issues that effected real people  to theorems, and reduced those people to mere mouthpieces.  There is no  subtext in Shaw - everything is expounded tediously and teeth-grindingly on  the surface.   ARMS AND THE MAN is one of his better efforts, and, after an  uncertain start, settles into some nice old-style farce - hidden  identities, buffoonish heroes, scheming servants, crusty old majors; when,  though, the puppets start lecturing us on war, idealism, class, gender  etc., one's heart sinks, not because what Shaw says isn't true, but because  a letter to the Times would have been a better place to say it.  While  Wilde's plays grow with the years, seeming richer, more meaningful,  brutally satiric, bursting with complex and fluid themes, Shaw's work, in  their steadfast refusal of mystery and ambiguity, seem chilly and remote 
 You get your money's worth here--there are a ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of "moist" sound when he pronounces words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on this one.  
 Don't waste your time on this, it's nothing but a glorified comic boo 
 Were it not for the outspoken protection of Shoshana Felman (founder of "trauma studies" in the Humanities) and Caruth's own clique-ish entente with Doctors Dori Laub and Bessel Van der Kolk (trauma experts of choice among Humanistic scholars), this book would have never come to light.  The book has been widely and uncritically acclaimed by literary scholars, though anyone expecting to draw any insight from it would do better reading chapter 8 of Ruth Leys's "Trauma.  A Genealogy".  The book blatantly misquotes Freud and Lacan for the sake of her own argumentative convenience.  For example, her manipulation of the text of Freud's "Moses and Monotheism" in chapter 3 is plain ludicrous.  Furthermore, it ignores the extensive body of work undertaken by psychiatrists and neuroscientists such as Daniel Schacter, Joseph Ledoux, and Richard McNally.  There is not a iota in medical evidence that supports Prof. Caruth's claims, yet this book has earned her a tenured teaching position at Emory University.    The book is founded on Bessel van der Kolk's claim that the traumatic event, because of its unordinary emotional intensity, fails to register itself in the cerebral cortex but is registered instead in the amygdala (this piece of psychiatric folklore has long been discredited by the statistical evidence that a vast majority of trauma victims remember consciously the traumatic event).  According to Caruth, the trauma is experienced as such in its literal and veridical repetition in the psychological life of the survivor.  That is to say that the trauma is a belated experience.  Yet there are plenty of holes in this claim, starting with the confusion between a state of shock as such (which implies an inability to respond to an event, not to experience it).  My main beef with this book is the author's quasimystical emphasis in the assumption that the survivor of trauma serves as a witness to the wound of those who have not survived, no matter how emotional it sounds, conceals many ethically problematic implications, not the least of which would be granting the charismatic status of trauma victim to the perpetrator of any lethal aggression 
 Altho the 747 was a mouthful... it left a bad taste in my mouth.  I needed a light read... too bad the oxygen masks did not operate... maybe some literary talent could have been breathed into this book.  
 This movie actually had potential (in the beginning) for a mediocre straight-to-DVD horror film. However, too much bad acting was present throughout most of the movie and the screenplay was brainless. Only watch this movie if you have nothing else to do. Overall, it's not really bad, there are a number of films far more insufficient than this. 
 the pin is not properly secured to the body of the pitter. after a few uses it will pop off. i've gone through three of these pitters from my local linens 'n things. how could the designers be so inept 
 Although I finished reading this book I did so imagining that at some point there would be a real narrative of experiences by those who lived it, i.e. a story of what happened. Instead it is like an assembly of facts and names and dates all of which I began to ignore. Without the story of what happened what difference do the dates, names, etc. make to anyone? Very disappointing read. 
 The first time I put this workout DVD on, I expected to see exercises designed for abs, buns and thighs.  What I actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing DVD.  I kept going, thinking it would get to the abs, buns and thighs, but it never did!  The other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up, or headshots only, so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine, you can't even learn it, because you cannot see the instructors legs or feet.  Also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming, picking up on a different beat to where it left off.  All in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $4.86 paid.  I turned it off halfway through the second workout and put Billy Blanks TaeBo on instead.  MUCH BETTER!!!  
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 I was anxious to get this game for my daughter for Christmas, as she loves all princess things.  Unfortunately, the instructions were so confusing (do they even test these games?  with real people?), we quickly grew disenchanted with it, and tossed it.  Quality is not top notch, and the instructions and actual game concept are poorly thought out 
 I had high expectations for this book.  I have studied almost every stop motion book there is and I have to say this is nothing special.  There are a few tips in it that I found enlightening but not enough to hold the whole book.  Although the author seems knowledgable in the field, she does not put her instructions across clearly.  I found it difficult to follow in that she gives a bit of info and then directs you to looks in later chapters, when writing instruction/how-to books it is wise to put things in order so thats the more basic blocks of info are placed at the beginning so you can refer BACK.  And perhaps this book may be a tad more useful to readers in the UK, as the author refers mostly to UK companies and retailers for supplies.  Over all I feel that there are a few things in this book that are useful and can not be found in other books.  Perhaps if you already have a collection (such as myself) it is nice to own to compliment other books, but as a stand alone it falls short of being very helpful 
 In order to tell the tale, a movie in the range of three hours would have been required. Instead, you are given about half of that (102 minutes). Instead of a solid bridge from start to finish, you are given stepping stones, some of which are covered in moss. To make matters worse, the actors seem over-rehearsed and uninspired. In some cases, the actors may have been miscast. The bottom line is this: READ THE BOOK. If you want to experience this story, there is no shortcut, you must read the book. I am confident you will find the written story a fine one indeed; worthy of reading 
 There's a ton of paper in this book, overboard, in my opinion. Wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious.  I've taken quite a few of the Sierra hikes and the information hasn't been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail. They miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation. I think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in California 
 I was going to buy this book because it was so highly recommended by Dr. Phil among others. When I checked the reviews at amazon books I decided it would be safer to check it out at my local library and I have to say THANKS FOR THE WARNING. This book was so bad I wanted to throw up. Who would raise their kids like this. Why would you want to make food a control issue and teach your kids animals are disposable. Whats up with the spanking. Why would you beat your own kids! Honestly, it might work but so would hitting them over the head with a 2X4. We are their parents, surely we can do better than that! 
 The ends are comming off this cable doesn't meet the normal Belkin standards 
 I worship Lou Reed as a god, but this album ranks among the dumbest things I've ever heard in my entire life. I do wish I could confront him and just ask what exactly he thinks he is doing - maybe that would serve to explain this pap. Mediocre, dirge-like tunes offset by hideously pretentious lyrics and now and then disturbingly hammy readings by notable actors. Avoid it like the plauge 
 OS 10.4 seeks to be all things to all men, thus it contains many MB of no possible use to most users. It needs to include a purging program to remove trash. Fonts in foreign languages, translations (how many people in the US want to convert classical Chinese to simplified Chinesw), printer drivers for printers that the user doesn't have consume a great deal of space. This book needs to be far more aggressive.  
 We checked this out from the library a couple of years ago.  It really was torture to watch.  The acting was terrible, the costumes were even worse.  I don't know whether to say it was really funny or really sad, because all in all it was a pretty pathetic production.  Not one of BBC's better efforts 
 I had high hopes going into this book. I had learned of the "divine proportion" in a linear algebra class I'd taken and it inspired me to pick this book up.   In the beginning I wasn't surprised, Livio outlined so many amazing applications of phi that I couldn't wait to get into the more in depth explanations. However, once I had, it seemed to me that Livio was convincing me that It wasn't so "divine." In any other applications other than simple geometry phi fails at being anything miraculous. For instance, when attempted to apply it into aesthetics it's useless.   The only reason I give this book 2 stars instead of 1 is that it gives a great overview of the history of Phi, which I appreciated. Other than that, it at least convinced me that Phi is just another way of looking for a set universal design. However, after further thought you should realize that if it weren't there, another mathematical structure would be. Because if we're working with simple Euclidean geometry, we're bound to come up with the same answers when looking for proportions in geometrical shapes.  
 I can't imagine why Mr. Andriessen's new opera Writing to Vermeer is garnering so much praise -- maybe "you had to be there." On CD, however, it's a grating, annoying, and self-consciously postmodern trial to endure... in fact, I finally had to just give up about halfway through the second disc. Life is too short, after all. 
 Yes,that's right.It was 1988 and MTV had succeeded in sucking the life out of rock 'n' roll: Awful hair-bands and wanna-be's flooded the airwaves.(remember Warrant's Cherry Pie?) AC/DC's new album at that time said it all: 'Blow up your Video!' This album and tour had alot of monumental events. The first being the return of Harry Vanda and George Young (Older bro to Malcom and Angus) as producers. The second being the last album with drummer Simon Wright (Dio).  Wright is a very talented drummer( I caught one of his drumsticks at the Long Beach show in '88!) Phil Rudd was taking time away to fly helicopters. The third event was Malcom leaving the band right before the US leg of the tour. (He was replaced by his nephew,Stevie. Malcom went into re-hab for booze.)   Unfortunately, this was their weakest album.Only the first two  tracks rock real good. The energy and lyrics dry up right after that. Phil had been missing since'83and the balance of the band had been thrown off a bit. On paper, this album should have been one of their great ones. It was a hit on the US charts. It got lots of radio airplay. It just isn't remembered as great, like Back in Black or Highway to Hell. It falls short. Still, AC/DC never sold out or changed their image to conform to the plastic late 80's trends in music. Angus said it best: "We didn't want to be part of that mainstream rock out there. We never wanted to be packaged and sold. We never went out there to sell our souls."  Let that be a lesson for Poison and Motley Crue! 
 After three weeks my brush broke too!  Cannot find a replacement, I do not want to buy a whole new rack.  Design fault that they should correct.  Not good enoug 
 Alright, second time I did.   But I still enjoyed it.  I went into this just hoping bolo would be in a few one-on-one fights, and luckily he was.  He looks pretty tough and is not a bad kung fu actor.   But his directing job just fails miserably.  Btu with a ton of great character actors and all teh final fight baddies are funny, so it wasn't a total loss of a movie.  Not like some of bolo's newer day stuff.  Overall a comedy that works, but only in that aspect, the kung fu could have been really good, but then againagain, I have seen much much worse.  The final fight was fun  and was a good way to end the movie.    Pai Pao is pretty good, but thsi movie I think would be really popular around the ladies, cause I got pretty sick at looking at bolo.  And his fake beard just ruined his character.  Also there is a part where bolo gets mad, and then smoke comes out of his nose.  enjoy  Also, the movie would have recieved a 3, but  some of the kung fu was actually really good and a widescreened presentation would have helped tremendously.  But then again, maybe I didn't see it very well cause bolo and pai paio were the action directors.    So full screened and a watchable picture.  No distortion or fuzzy lines, would have been watchable I guess if the movie was better.  
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

 Kevin Trudeau has an understandable vendetta against the government, big drug companies  and modern medicine at large but he goes on about things that I already knew.  Then, wanting his magic answers to the natural cures, he refers readers to his website where he asks a monthly membership fee.  In the end, you come away devoid of any alternative health solutions, unless you want to spring for his fee to access the website.  I call that a bunch of hype and empty promises.  How do I know whether or not his website is any more informative than his tease of a book? 
 This book was entertaining like a blockbuster movie- a pageturner. But I am horrified that people ignorant about Islam are getting their "information" from such an inaccurate and inflammatory source. 
 What these 2 artists bring to the table are heaping helpings of warmth, humanity, charm, even sweetness -- not to mention wit and originality.  Their trademark parodies of everyday situations, when they work, are nothing short of uproarious.  "Mother and Son" and "Merry Christmas, Doctor" are priceless, timeless routines that play so well 40 years later as to show the brilliant vision underlying this artistic duo's act and ability to push the envelope in their time.  The question in buying this CD is whether the strength of those cuts, plus the generous quantity of cuts, can compensate for the faded vitality of the others imposed by the passing of time 
 This product just doesn't cut my nose hair as close as the Panasonic it replaced. If I could remember the model of the Panasonic, I would mention it in this review. I hope I can find the manual for the Panasonic so I can get another one.  Beware that many of the new designs are going this rout (even Panasonic). The manufacturers are saying this allows for more natural filtration, but I think its more of a liability issue on their part (someone probably got sued for a nicked nose). I just won't buy their products anymore if they're going to design them for marginal performance 
 Nothing against this publication, but it was not what I was looking for.  I thought it would give the value of individual issues of specific magazines which it did for what I would consider antique magazines.  However, there was very little information provided on old issues of contemporary magazines. 
 I used to like these guys, but the more songs I hear by Minor Threat and TSOL, the more I realize how the Offspring were just copycats.  What a discrace to punk.  I wish bands like the Offspring, Good Charlotte, Green Day, Blink 182, Simple Plan, and New F@g glory would just (...) off!  The only "American Idiots" are the ones that buy into this boy band poser punk.  "WE'RE JUST A MINOR THREAT! 
 This is on the overall a good book as the other reviews have testified.  There is one major problem, the author talks very little about risk.  She recommends that you get deeply into debt and use that leverage to make money.  That's ok and many people have made money that way.  Many people have also lost their shirt that well as well.  The book would have been much enhanced is she spent a chapter talking about the risks involved with taking on massive amounts of debt, especially for the small investor - the target audience - who likely doesn't have much to lose.  She should've included several case studies, some that look those who have successfully used leverage (debt), and looked at some who lost everything.  Then she could've analyzed what were the underlying factors and decisions that led to either failure or success.  Instead the author casts debt in an overly positive light, saying almost nothing about the risks involved.  This is all well for her, she began to buy several years before the biggest real estate boom in the history of the country.  But there have been plenty of real estate markets in the past where investors took on too much debt and lost not only their investment properties, but everything else as well.  Any credible book about investing has a responsibility to spend a healthy amount of time discussing risk.  It's like being enthusiastic about a medication but not saying anything about the potential side effects or hazards.  Such an approach is bad medicine, and Ms. Thomas' book is bad teaching because she ignores the subject of debt, and for that reason I took off 3 stars.    Beyond that, it's a very good starter book.  
 I'm getting married again after 20 years of being single & was looking for relevant advice.  It was not to be found in this book.  It's a very traditional stodgy book for people who are afraid to break the rules.  There are better choices out there.  Hint:  look for books with the word "grownup" in the title 
 Average album from West Coast veteran, RBX, released from Daz Dillinger's independent imprint, Gangsta Advisory. RBX, who came up with Snoop & Tha Dogg Pound during the Death Row era of the early 90's, never really had a breakthrough solo effort despite a ghastly flow and an ominous voice. "Ripp Tha Game Bloody" has a few decent tracks but is far too guest-heavy to be considered a solo album. All-star appearances by Snoop on "Tell It! (The Remix)" and Daz on "Jus... Murda" are pretty underwhelming but his collabo with former Doggystyle artist, E. White on "They Run" is the highlight here. There are some other worthwhile tracks like "Summer In The City", "Crime", "RBX", and "Picasso", but for the most part, the album is nothing special. Another problem I had with the album is that it has no production credits, thus all of its young unknowns continue to go unknown. "Ripp The Game Bloody" should have been more 
 When I first picked up Drinking Coffee Elsewhere, I was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy.  And, truthfully, it's not a horrible book.  It is entertaining, the style works, etc.  On that note, if you're looking for a fun read and don't plan on thinking about it too much, then by all means, get it.  My problem with the book is that it doesn't deserve all the acclaim it's getting-- if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of America, this is not your book.  Probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the African American female. Packer has very little new to say, and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by Alice Walker and other writers, but have also have been said better by those authors.  Drinking Coffee Elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of You Can't Keep a Good Woman Down, a book that, while having its own problems, would probably be a better use of your time and money if you're really interested in the social commentary in the text.  Even from the literary standpoint, it's not terribly outstanding.  The characters are stereotypes; the plots are predictable.  The adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person-- an intelligent outsider who struggles with race, religion, and fitting in-- and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so.  The other protagonists are the same, just not so irritable.  Similar to this lack of variation in her characters, Packer varies little in her narrative style.  Yes, the language is pretty at times, but there is no experimentation with language or structure; all of the writing is in a highly generic voice.  Finally, the stories themselves contain scenes that aren't necessary and that detract from the actual narrative.  In short, Drinking Coffee Elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books isn't actual talent, but how much your publisher backs you.  Packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs, which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out 
 Ostensibly about homesteading during World War I, this is actually about the Iraq war, as the author admits in the epilogue.  If only Americans didn't hate people who come from foreign countries so much, if only we were not so jingoistic, if only our government didn't fill us with patriotic propaganda to convince us to go fight pointless wars, if only our local leaders didn't employ fascist tactics to force us to support those wars.  If only, if only - America would be universally loved, right?  At least the Newbery committee thinks so.  Given the number of prizewinning books pushing this same theme, it continually amazes me that there are still some American youth willing to enlist.  There are some pretty scenes here about homesteading in the far west, but the backbreaking nature of the work doesn't come through at all, not surprising given that the author states in her bio that she spends her free time drinking lattes.  And as for World War I?  We learn nothing other than that it was a senseless waste.  Parents, when your child is assigned this book in school, read it first,  Have a discussion with your child about the actual causes of World War I.  Mention that the United States got involved in the war only after the Germans invaded Belgium and then France, and after they sank U.S. merchant ships as well as passenger ships with a large loss of American lives.  Have your child go through the book and underline all the passages where the author is trying to manipulate him.  This will serve a useful pedagogic purpose, albeit not one that the Newbery committee intends:  an object lesson in how to be a serious reader and a serious student of history, and how to resist mind-control from the children's literature mandarins 
 One of TP's principal themes: ie., his formulaic, over-caffeinated insistence that individuals can improve organizations by orders of magnitude through relentless, enthusiastic Petersian motivation, is a Sysyphean proposition.   It flies in the face of those human frailties that always have and will limit the efficiency properties and the effectiveness of organizational hierarchies: bounded rationality, opportunism, docility, cognitive biases, etc.  TP should know this but fails to take these factors systematically into account by seeming always to assume that these negatives are properties of the "others", not you, the reader.  Yet how many more Nobel prizes will it take before these fundamentals inform our thinking and action?    Brand yourself? Oh, sure.  Then, as Asian-U.S. wage rate disparities and trade-barrier reductions continue wreaking creative destruction, go rearrange the deck chairs and get ready to swim.    You CAN shape your emerging economic future, provided you are disciplined in the way you attune yourself to opportunities.    One alternative path: why not read some truly insightful thinking?  Go to Google Scholar.  Enter, "resource-based view of the firm" [use quotes].  Get ready: 4,960 pages at last count.  And that's just one way to begin your voyage.  You certainly will find some 'tough rowing.' The reward is well worth it: gaining an understanding of how varied are the points of economic intervention in one's career and life-path.    Gain mastery over your attentional style for sensing and seizing opportunity.  Don't let just any author seize your attention.  Don't be a sissy: Drop the boulder, ie., don't be Sysyphean.  
 Anyone who wants to read a horrible depiction of an abortion should buy this book. The author condones the killing of an unborn fetus and even tells of how she did it three times, once on her own at home even. I threw this book away and will never buy another book by the author. Anyone who is Pro-Life should definately NOT support this author is ANY WAY! This woman disgusts me 
 I am a great lover of biscotti, especially since I have to watch my sugar intake. Because biscotti can be expensive, I decided to make this simple cookie and have quite successfully.  However, this book is not the book to buy if one wants biscotti of good texture and taste.  I remade one recipe (Almond Biscotti) and tried two others (Coconut Biscotti and Milk Chocolate & Honey) to see if I made a mistake or preferred another flavor, but none of them were worth the effort. They were dry and too hard. The recipes I found on-line and in magazines were much better.  I'll try another book 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 This dreary account of a foul-mouthed adulterer who consistently makes the wrong choices might remind some of other tragic characters in great fiction, such as the protagonist in An American Tragedy or in  Crime and Punishment or Madame Bovary.  But the difference here is that Bob Dubois never learns, he repeatedly does the dumb thing, whether it is adultery or use of dope or abusing his wife or his poor innocent children.  One can hardly help being disgusted by a man who does not seem to have a brain in his body.  Only a moron would break all the windows in his own car when he is short of money for his wife and kids, or wreck his home, or booze and do dope when he does not know how to pay for necessary care for his child.  As for all the stuff about voodoo this may be interest to some but to me was a bore.  Surely the account of the Haitians' plight is distressing, but it helps to make this book a depressing one.  Frankly I was glad when I finished this pretentious and not well-written book, and thought Dubois got what he asked for and deserved 
 Reception is only acceptable if you are seated with the headphone antenna adjusted to maximize signal strength 
 This book may be helpful for some people who want to know more about possible conspiracies. Personally, I believe some of them; but that's not why I purchased this book. This book is highly misrepresented on Trudeau's infomecials. There are no specific recommendations for treatment of any illnes in this book. Only some vague references to start you on a paper chase. There is not even an index in the book to direct you to information on a specific illness. This book is basically another infomercial for his subscription website. 
 The graphics, illustrations and figures add no value to the book. They confuse the reader and distract their attention away from the authors points. I would not recommend reading this book unless the graphics were  removed 
 I love Dr. Seuss, and enjoy reading most of his stories to my 1.5 year old son.  But this book is surprisingly bland.  The illustrations are pitiful, and done mostly in browns.  The story doesn't hold my son's (or my) interest past the first 6 or so pages.  If I'd known this, I would've skipped this book and opted for a more classic Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs & Ham 
 I liked the software itself.  Being the first year I used it, I thought I'd start being a regular TT customer.  Then it was April 17 2007 and I tried to e-file.  The servers would not respond ALL DAY. There were no admins to be reached on the support sites or the forums (except for one who said "I don't know what is the problem and I have nothing to tell you").  One major failing with this software is that it cannot AUTOMATICALLY try to connect.  If it fails, it says "try again in 10 minutes".  Which I've had to do all night.  Now - I will miss my tax deadline and have spent 6 hours at my computer trying to get connected.  Mail is not an option now as my car is gone.  This is a major failure of the company and an utter lack of support, since their officials apparently couldn't be bothered to come in to work on tax day to offer us any solutions.  I will not buy again.  
 I found this book to be a lot of common sense without a lot of fresh ideas. The author is from Indiana and constantly sites examples from that part of the country which didn't help me at all. The constant plugs to hire  a bridal consultant become tiresome. I wouldn't recommend this book unless  you didn't have a clue about the wedding process 
 Paul Bowles' Let it Come Down is a footpath into the woods which appears promising at its entrance, but eventually peters out.  Our protagonist, Dyer, arrives friendless in post-war Tangier and quickly finds the love of his life (a prostitute), and his true calling (illicit currency exchange).  He navigates past the expatriate shoals and the native doldrums, and experiences his first original thought (steal the money) when he arrives too late at the foncier.  You figure out "foncier" from context, but the trail narrows further and eventually the context peters out, too.  The trail's end is a hashhish induced torpor in which childhood memories erupt and the essense of irrationality is explored.  No worry; we're sitting on a sunny terrace outside Thani's wife's family's shack in the hills of the Spanish Zone, the policia seem to be several miles away, and the birds are singing.  Let it come down 
 The book documented the pitfalls of the entire process from buying to initially living in a manufactured home. It was written from the prespective of documentating the author's excursion into buying a home and sprinkled with some anecdotes of other buyers experiences. It was strong on counter tactics but I felt weak on prevention.  The book was padded with court cases and amortization tables. After I read the book, I concluded the entire process was so full of crooks - why bother. Why bother - obviously you need a cheap house, which as the book illustrates may become, in time, very expensive. The book did not live up to my expectations based on the earlier reviews 
  Bought this book thinking that it might be the key to opening my brain to math. I'm bad at math. So I've been reading every subject surrounding it hoping to grasp an understanding of what it is and maybe have that "eureka" moment. But it didn't happen.  So maybe I'm judging this book harshly just because it failed to intrigue me enough to understand math.  Have you ever noticed how people who can add and subtract in their heads tend to laugh at us people who can't? And then they tsk-tsk us when we can't even get it right on paper. Yet, along with me, they can make gross mistakes in English and those who know better say nothing at all, lest they hurt their feelings.... 
 The photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition's cover. However you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of The Doorbell Rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances. The mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen.   With just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes. The favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story. The Doorbell Rang begins with a Mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son Sam and daughter Victoria. " I've made some cookies for tea, said Ma". The children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to Grandma's.  By flipping through the pages of the Doorbell Rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger, but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there, but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats. The cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention. More kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie. It is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth. The serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer. Meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail.   The final arrival for this story is Grandma, with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. All the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table. Not very sanitary as far as I am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table. The dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home.    The portrayal of the Mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me. The kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them.   At least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the Mother finally sat down. For a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read I highly doubt there would be interest. There is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child's Grandma's cookies. There are roughly two to four sentences on each page. The good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this 
 I purchased this book because as a David Sedaris fan it was recommended to me by Amazon ("if you like this book, you'll like..."). After reading a few pages I realized that the only thing David Sedaris and Rakoff have in common is their first name.  Sedaris engages his readers and accompanies them on the journey he puts forth in print. Rakoff however, throws his words at the reader and runs away, abandoning the reader in a quagmire of over-thought words and phrases. I'm an educated person, but Rakoff uses words that I've never heard before. You need to read this book with an accompanying dictionary.  There is at least one word per page that you'll have to lookup, even if you're a college professor.  I tried to finish this book, but only made it about  way through. It was too much work, and I like to read for pleasure. 
 This book was not in the same league of Frazier's first effort.  I found myself not caring about the characters and basically wanting the book to end.  The lack of a plot would be fine if you could get caught up in the character or lost in the beauty of the language but the writing is so overblown and tedious the fact that nothing much is happening stands out.  I really wanted to like this book and I was trying hard to like it as I read it but the fact of the matter is, this is a bad book 
 What a scam.  While some of the principles in this book are based on truth, it is scandalous that a doctor would abuse his role in order to make a profit. Most of the strategies he claims will give miraculous results are truly just a waste of money with a tiny grain of truth at the center.  While it's true one should get enough vitamins (centrum will do just fine) and use good products to care for skin (drugstore ones are generally just as effective, and in this case more-so), using his products & strategies can only help you by convincing you to do what you already know you should - keep your face & body clean & healthy.  His brand line is a waste of money & does not even reach the status of "ordinary" 
 Good deal for the price.  However, the book is very small and hard to write in.  It would be better if it was in a spiral bound book.  I found it extemely hard to write in.  Great concept, but lacking in the design of the book 
 I'm sorry that I ordered these online. I should have tried them first. They do not fit round heads. No matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit. The bow needs to have an adjustment too.  The magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off. Would not buy another pair. 
 A mediocre story, poorly written and horribly read (by the author).The monotone of the reader is so bad that it takes a while to realize the shortcomings of the actual story.  The characters are one-dimensional, and the items that might make them more interesting are only hinted at, never explored.  There are far more well-written thrillers out there.  Take the time to find one of them, and leave Toyer on the shelf 
 This album sounds awful! Ayla was eliminated off of American idol because she could not sing...so why did American idol call her back to make a CD? I can't believe that they would have the nerve to try to unload the CD on innocent consumers in an attempt to defraud them of their hard earned money. This album sounds awful because it is awful! Save your money and buy Kellie Pickler or Carrie Underwood 
 This is not a book, but a rambling memoir filled with too many personal comments of little substance.  Do not expect an objective analysis as to the causes or the events surrounding the Kosovo conflict.  Nor expect a CLEAR or INSIGHTFUL book on how military decisions are made and executed.    Any value this book may have had in describing the decision making process between the US military and its political leadership was buried in the almost constant self complementary remarks 
 The author is probably a great guy personally, but his writing falls very short. The book does not even address Paul's views on the role of women, or on homosexuality--two areas where people of our times need guidance. It seems as if the author wanted to be "politically correct" and not offend anyone.  He doesn't even address, with any authority, the conflict between Paul and Barnabas over John Mark. He just basically says they should have worked it out. I was completely disappointed in the book. 
 If you can read something that looks like it was written by a five year old child, as well as not get sick to your stomach on all the trash it covers, this only confirms that the networks are only interested in money, not program content 
 The good news is the watch's case is quite nice. Now the could-be-improved points. It's sized weird. It's a lot larger than you think. Add to that it's bracelet is rather small so now that I removed a single link I can barely get it over my average sized wrist, and once it's on it's still too loose. Weird , but true. Frankly it's good looking, but I don't think I'll get another one. 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 I thought that I had found the perfect gift for my mother.The description provided was not what I got. When I received my package there were two problems. First, the storage box that I received, while still very beautiful, was not what was pictured nor as big as what was pictured. Secondly, I received no flatware. I immediately called and a new set was sent to me. . same problem...wrong box, no flatware. So I had to send them both back and can't even get the item because no one knows why the error kept occurin 
 D&G is one of the top five brands but this book made me cry from disappointment. The book is very small and does not have many pages. The book begins with a "Dolce & Gabbana Glossary." The glossary has words like, "Animal Print," "Black," "Tank Top," etc. I know what the color "black" is. Apparently the author assumes the reader is stupid and does not know what the color black is.  The pictures are a big mound of doo doo. All the pictures (with the exception of two) are in black and white. (The other two pictures of a yellow color).  Almost ALL of the great pictures can be seen in "10 years of Dolce & Gabbana." I recommend that book over this one. Also, the pictures in this book are not even great looking. There are no advertisements or pictures from the catwalk. Buy "10 years of D&G" instead and you'll enjoy it more 
 Unlike the Chicken Soup authors, Dan feels it's neccessary to add his opinion at the end of each story which leaves the impression he's telling the reader how to feel or react to the story.  These heartwarming, tender stories speak for themselves. It's a very diappointing purchase 
 I have been a reader of BusinessWeek for over 10 years.  I have noticed that it has had a significant change in focus over the last year.  While there are more articles on "Personal Business", the hard-core articles have gone the way of Newsweek, and U.S. News and World reports.  The nature of the articles are lightweight and do not reflect issues important to decision makers today.  Like many others, I have noticed a political slant or agenda over the last year.  Specifically, their commentaries and economic analysis trend to the left.  Bob Kuttner is co-editor of the American Prospect and contributor to the Boston Globe.  Every one of his articles begins with the premise that the President's policies are bad and then is followed by a tortuous rational for that thesis, to include discussion of the days of gold backed currency.  Andrea D'Andrea Tyson is better, but as a former Clinton advisor, is not objective in her analysis.  Alternative economic opinions are far and few between and what opinions they do tout, does not agree with the numbers stated in their own Figures of the Week.  While BW has the potential for great reporting based on their resources, they have let their editorial priorities get in the way of serious business reporting.  For serious Business readers and students, I recommend going to alternative sources.  And yes, I will let my subscription lapse this year. 
 That aluminum woman on the front cover is ludicrous. What makes the author think any old master ever began that way?  You will do better if you look for a book by a painter whose own work does not appear amateurish 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult comes down a level in terms of quality.  Rather than narrowing the scope and developing it well, this novel is a pinball machine of ideas, people and issues that never come together.  I kept holding out for an ending that would redeem the rest of the story but was disappointed till the final word 
 These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance 
 The absolute worst book eve 
 Beware! This thing, even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure, as well as not keep it in one spot, it took the top layer of skin off! My poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work. Ow! I had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed. And what's worse, it didn't take out all the hair.... I could still see some hair here and there it missed, and I thought I got it all. I returned it immediately and got a refund on my money. Never again.... I'll stick to my good ol' electric razor instead.... 
 When I read stuff on the back of this novel like, "preposterously brilliant", "a classic comic novel", and "Amis was a genuine comic writer, perhaps the best", I immediately snatched this book up and started rummaging through the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters with heightened interest. The book was interesting enough for me to buy it from Borders bookstore 30 minutes after reading a bit. Even though I didn't laugh, I believed I just had to read it from beginning to end. So I took this book home expecting something hilarious; the result: a genuine cure for insomnia. I don't care for all these praises of "masterpiece" or "this book explores the complexities of human condition and human relations". I want an interesting read; I'm not calling for an action-packed Ian Fleming, James Bond novel, I'm asking for something engrossing. I didn't get what I asked for.  The visually descriptive details in this novel are thoroughly lacking. Amis doesn't bother to write about the setting, the atmosphere, the people (except for Bertrand, Christine, and Margaret to some degree); as a result I have no idea what Welch, Dixon, Beesley, etc. look like. They all could be wearing bedsheets all the time for all I know.   All in all, this novel is not recommended: it lacks physical detail and humor.   P.S. If you search all the previous good recommendations you'll see the high reviews were simply given by "a reader"; probably the same dude 
 The portrayal of the Bobo in this book, and, more importantly, the fascination and inner glee with which many will gobble up this portrayal, seem light-hearted and fun, but herein lies the reason that Dubya managed to win over the hearts and minds of good, average, working-class people everywhere. Shockingly similar to Brooks' depictions is the conversatives' and right-wing fundamentalists' portrayal of liberals and Democrats: as effete, latte-loving milquetoasts, who know little to nothing about the travails and tribulations of hard-working, ordinary folk. The resulting "cultural wars," based on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and separation of church and state, served as the perfect mask to the dark agenda that Bush and the right-wingers have planned: privatization of social security, revamping of the tax and bankruptcy codes to benefit large corporations and the ultra-wealthy, the destruction of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the list goes on and on.  Although I will admit to having enjoyed many of the anectodes in this book, it must be pointed out that they appeal only on the basest, most superficial level, and for this I am ashamed. Diverted by all the gadgets, toys, and conveniences of modern-day living, and the incessant feed of so-called ideas from a putatively liberal media, the Bobos and the primates who poke fun at them remain blissfully oblivious to the utter economic and environmental disaster that we're headed toward.  Instead of spending your money on this book, I recommend that you sit down, find some well-written blogs, and read some (free!) critical commentary on politics and the state of our country, and then try to formulate your own ideas about our society today; in other words, THINK for yourself 
 Your body and you control what goes in your mouth.  Your choice how you take care of it.  Your great grandparents were pretty smart.  Lived a long time and the doctor was never around nor was he needed. 
 I'm not Catholic, but I was interested in learning about any evidence disproves the theories set forth in The DaVinci Code,so that I would understand their opposition to the book.   I thought this book would give me an objective view of the historic facts that The Davinci Code was based on, instead, it denied the theories using mostly beliefs as their supporting evidence.    I was disappointed because I had a hard time learning, from an academic perspective, why the Catholic church might have been falsely represented in this book 
 I ordered this book and it didn't come, and I said ok send it to me later, adn then it didn't come and I said ok send it later and again and again after four extensions I gave up. This may be a great book or not, but it is not avaiable. I would have liked to have had a cahnce to read it. Disappointed in the service. 
 As a feminist, I hate movies that portray women as victims who struggle futile against the big bad evil MAN.  There are no good men in this movie.  There are no evil women.   Such portrayals of women are demeaning.  We are human beings, just like men.  We are capable of evil.  Men are capable of good.  Yes, some men would turn their wives into robots if they could, but so would some women!  And I find it ridiculous that not one man stood up for his beloved partner.  I find it ridiculous that not one woman was capable of true evil.  Are we puppets?  It also bothers me that if these women are so strong and powerful, that they are helpless against the big bad men.  The message seems to be that we can't save ourselves.  We are just doomed to be what men want us to be.  I hate this attitude.  Men are not all powerful.  Women are human beings, not saints.    Two stars, though, for capturing the fears of women everywhere 
 This coby product functioned only two months for me. Hardly worth spending the money on. 
 If imitation is the highest form of praise, then this book must be one of the most praised books in the English canon.  A man from a middle-class upbringing leaves it and ends up stuck on a tropical island.  This story would inspire Swiss Family Robinson, Castaway, and probably Lord of the Flies.  Mr. Crusoe is a white, Englishman with a wife and kids.  After the wife dies, he leaves the kids to go on his own and to serve God.  He ends up stuck on an island by himself.  There he encounters cannibalistic natives, and one of their intended victims.  The former scares him, and he essentially enslaves the latter, teaching him to call him Master.    The book is not that interesting, as tales of desperation and survival are actually quite common 
 this guitar is shockingly bad- cheaply made and broke withing one minute of my tiny two year old touching it, the bridge fell off, the strings snapped when we tried to tune it. The extra string (yes, that's singular) didn't even fit! don't waste your money 
 Chuck has nothing to worry about here. While Drake has a great voice and a vivid imagination this book just ran out of steam. It probably would have worked better as a short story. I found Nita's self-imposed hardships to be quite grating after about 100 pages and there were still 200 pages of the same to go. It all got a bit repetitious and obvious after awhile. I also didn't find the book funny. I didn't laugh once. I have to add that I am in no way the sharpest tool in the shed but even I saw the ending coming a mile away. 
 In a quest to find the perfect chocolate chip cookie, I followed this recipe with enthusiasm and excitement.  When I served them, the expression on everybody's face was more than I needed to know, they were absolutely the most disgusting chocolate chip cookies I had ever tasted!  Not only did the batches of cookies go in the garbage, so did the book.  
 If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, "Eaters of the Dead" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel.  This was mostly a bore. Don't bother 
 By now (December 12, 2004) we've learned a few facts about self-promoting blowhard BERNARD KERIK. How marvelous that "The Lost Son" has already been optioned for development as a major motion picture - it has the potential to become the funniest biopic since "Mommie Dearest." I do hope the screenwriter will include a role for JENNIFER LOPEZ as the illegal domestic worker (J-Lo was great in "Maid in Manhattan") and wouldn't MARGARET CHO be wonderful as Bernie's abandoned Korean daughter 
 So I decided maybe I'll give this exploitation thing a try considering I love gore,violence, and horror movies. The reason I give it a 1 star is because it just isn't that good of a movie. It's VERY boring for most of the movie. About the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said. Then the guys just rape this woman several times, then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge. It's very slow paced and doesn't live up to the hype. It isn't all that gory, and it isn't scary either. Also, the rape isn't that convincing. I'm not saying I need everything shown in detail, but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal. Oh, and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was practically mentally retarded. The guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad. That is not grounds for what she did to him, which in my opinion was the worst of the killings. Anyways. not that good of a movie, don't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not 
 Does anyone besides Seabury Blair's friends like this book?  Marlene Kocur liked it but she has also drew the maps for the book.  Another reader gave it 5 stars but also happens to live on the Olympic Peninsula.  Probably another of Mr. Blair's friends.  If you give this horrendous book a positive review please be completely honest about whether or not the author happens to be a friend of yours.  Blair has written a pamphlet for beginning cross-country skiers and then stretched it into a book by printing the same route descriptions over and over again.  Then he slapped a cover on it to try and sell it to backcountry skiers and snowboarders.  A quick perusal at the bookstand would make this obvious but on the web we don't have that luxury 
 This book is heavy on jargon and vendor provided information - it is essentially a collection of articles from Computer Telephony magazine, without much editing or organization.  It lacks technical depth and is poorly organized for researching information, e.g., its index is essentially a word occurance listing 
 It was in pretty poor taste for amazon.com to send an email announcing the publication of this book without mentioning it was a blank notebook.  My son and I were very disappointed when we found it was not, as it appeared to be, really a book in the Series of Unfortunate Events.  I consider it an unfortunate event indeed. 
 I loved Fixer Jay's original book, Investing In Fixer Uppers, so I was thrilled to buy his second book as soon as I heard about it.  It is an ok book, but it is his original book in a new cover.  Even some of the sentences are the same.  It was kind of like listening to a friend who tells you the same stories without remembering that he has told you already, using the same words, gestures and inflection.  I was dissapointed that there is actually no explanation for creating a 2-year plan anywhere in the book.  The closest thing that I could find to a 2-year plan, was a sentence on page 8 that said, "Two years after you acquire your first property, you should have a dependable income, assuming that you're following my strategies."  Then comes an analogy that investing in real estate is like kissing frogs to find a prince.  I suppose that it is, but it didn't help me with a 2-year plan.  If you are interested in fixing up houses to rent for income, don't hesitate to buy Jay's first book-I have read it 5 times, and am using his strategies from that book right now, having just fixed up an older house in my neighborhood.  With 3 month's part time work, I now have 28k in equity, and 209.00 per month positive cashflow, on my first fix-up ever, thanks to his first book.  The house was even owner financed, 2% down, and deferred payments too! (Jay's strategies) Don't bother with the 2-year plan book though, because it isn't anything new 
 This film is boring and very disconnected. The highlights for me were hearing Cate Blanchett (brava!) and Giovanni Ribisi (also bravo, but work on the `chiesa') speak Italian. In Gone in 60 Seconds, Giovanni, who must be a second generation Italian-American, plays Kit's little brother. In this film, he's a carabiniere that translates for Cate Blanchett, the (British) English teacher of Giovanni's brother.  The setting is Turin, or Torino as the 2006 Olympic Winter Games are officially titled. Cate Blanchett speaks excellent Italian. Unfortunately, though, neither of the Americans really speak enough Italian, and both of them revert to English or awkward silence (e.g. Ribisi mumbling `grazie' to their host on the farm) throughout the film.  I read the back of the DVD case and had dramatically different expectations about the plot. Like, where's the mafia, the drug dealers, the husband? The movie revolves around Cate's inadvertent slaughter of innocent children and her eventual getaway with Ribisi. Thumbs down. Uninspiring end 
 While this is an excellent and well written story, the Blackstone Audio version is horribly read. It is painful to listen to. The reader is very "nasal" and the attempts at accents and characterizations are just simply horrific. Find another version, or read the book if you can. I can't, and had to endure this version of the audiobook. I listen to a LOT of audiobooks and this experience was a nightmare 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I would not recommend this toy to anybody.  My daughter loves Dora so that's why I got it for her but it's not very durable at all.  The least little pressure on the bottom edges and it just bends in that direction.  She's had it for a couple weeks now and it won't even stand up by itself anymore.  It is not worth the money.  
 I was extrememly unhappy with this necklace.  The picture on-line makes it look beautiful with light shining thru the amethyst (ha, looks like cut glass not real amethyst!)/Even putting it up to the natural light it looked dull/fake/plastic.  I emailed and got a reply I would get a full discount just mail it back.  Well, I mailed it back with insurance costing $6.55 after already paying shipping to have it sent to me.  Because I feel it was NOT advertised in a 'correct light' I asked for my shipping back for both charges and disputed the charge with my credit card company.  The refund from Amazon was only the cost of the necklace with neither shipping charge.  I am still going to dispute the the shipping charges because this jewelry did NOT look like it did on the website 
 This book was NOT FUNNY.  Anybody who compares it to Woody Allen is hurting Woody!  He wrote about his imagined friendship with President Kennedy; not funny.  The Hansen's Christmas letter each year was not funny.  Even the discussion of Martha Stewart's vagina was not funny.  The book looked like it was trying too hard and totally missed the mark. The title could have been really funny and wasn't.  I bought it in the aiport and had a long plane ride and was really psyched to read it.  The book was lousy from beginning to end and I don't even recall anything funny in the entire book.  Don't waste your money.  See the show, but don't bother with such a lame book. I would have given it NO STARS, but the system wouldn't let me 
 The series is brilliant. This DVD release is not. Both the original and the replacement that amazon sent me were defective. Scenes would skip, certain episodes would "stick" every few seconds, some episodes and special features wouldn't play at all and would just kick you back to the main menu, and disc 1 on both copies was completely unplayable. (I would get "cannot play disc" errors.)  I was afraid that maybe my DVD player was being finicky, but then I bought the first-run, individually released seasons through amazon marketplace sellers and ebay. They play just fine, with no problems. I'm not sure what happened with this release and why there are so many glitches, but my recommendation is to find some copies of the originals and buy those. They're always some used copies floating around on amazon and ebay. Mine are used, and they play great.  BTW, you get pretty much the exact same extras and features with the first-run releases, with the exception of maybe a couple of things, so you're not really missing a whole lot. Plus, the boxes are sturdier 
 This book is wicked hard to understand and follow!!! I am 17 years old and i am in a college prep american history class, and i dont understand. How am i supossed to learn anything if i cant read the words!! 
 This book is written by an idiot. I returned this book! This man does not know what he's saying and as far as the ppl he's helped he must have been lucky or just annoyed the "negs" until they left. For anyone that has actually studied the occult you would see that this guy knows nothing. Just another "ghost hunter" with big toys, and superstitions. I do NOT recommend this book, unless its for a laugh. 
 The Mysteries of Udolpho is beautifully written.  Ann Radcliffe writes page after page, after page...of picturesque descriptions of Italy and France's countryside.   That being said, I found The Mysteries of Udolpho to be long winded and drawn out.  The first two volumes are rather mind-numbing and I skimmed over much of it.  I never felt a connection towards Emily and felt rather indifferent towards her well being.  I found her to be rather insipid and became tired of her constant fits of weeping and fainting.  Her servant, Annette, was more intriguing than Emily and her pathetic weakness. I would personally recommend skipping The Mysteries of Udolpho to read Sheridan Le Fanu's novel Uncle Silas.  Young Maud finds herself in similiar circumstances but approaches them with not only grace and sweetnss but a strength that she "finds from a place unknown" to herself.  You will cheer for Maud in a way that seems impossible to do for Emily 
 The book was interesting to me because the author speaks about life in the Army. Some soldiers got good and bad experience  during their time. The book makes comments about three diferent soldiers 
 it is not obvious that this is a PC version - If you use a mac like me don't get this one. look at the tiny print on the cover 
 Of the many O'Reilly books that I have purchased, this is the first one that was really poor. I'd give it -5 stars, but the lowest you allow is 1. The author seemed more interested in being clever and funny, then imparting information.  However, I also have two very large Perl books that are also almost useless, so maybe it's a Perl problem 
 Having read all of Sedaris's books, I think it's fair to say that this is easily his weakest. I suppose it should be expected since it was written before the others, but if you read the reviews on the book you'd think it was world class literature. The only stories I enjoyed in it are "My Manuscript" and "Glen's Homophobia Newsletter Vol.3, No. 2." The essays "Diary of a Smoker" and "Santaland Diaries" are good as well. Ultimately his essays are still better than his stories which accounts for their making up all his other books. The stories are agonizingly over-the-top; that style work well on tv shows like Strangers with Candy but is painful in print. Do yourself a favor and skip this for one of his other MUCH better books (i.e. Me Talk Pretty One Day or Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim) 
 I remember listening to a radio station that was giving away as many records as you could name in 10 seconds.  The caller gets on and says, "Chicago 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 etc.  I guess Hot Streets would have slowed the process.....Anyways Hot Streets is further document of Chicagos gradual descent into easy listening oblivion and oh what a dreadful place that is... 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 The book isn't the one in the picture or the one you can view.  It is a MINIATURE ADDITION.  It only has a few pages and minimal information.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! 
 Brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them.  This is a blatant effort to wrench young children's emotions and therefore their perspectives  about the eeeevil effects of "global warming" by engaging their sympathies.  The only plot is brainwashing, using penguins as the straw man.  The penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them.  As a responsible parent, I would avoid this entirely. 
 Very disappointed in this year's calendar.  I have ordered this calendar for several years, will not order again....In fact have just sent for another calendar (The Secret Garden) and will toss the "Porch" one.  The date/day grid for each month is not in pretty colors, the grid and the pictures are formatted differently from last year and do not work well for my use. The pictures are not pretty and they all look the same...where are all the lovely Southern homes with gingerbread trimmed porches and lovely flowery chairs? etc.  Sorry, this calendar is a loser 
 I saw this book in the book store the other night and almost bought it.  Norman Jewison was on the TCM documentary of Steve McQueen, seemed like a nice guy with some fascinating stories, and I thought it would be interesting to read about his career and all the celebrities he has worked with.  I thumbed through the book, reading bits and pieces.  On the back cover was a praising review from Gore Vidal - Strike 1.  Below that was a praising review from Cher - Strike 2.  Inside was a picture of Jewison with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas - Strike 3.  Not to mention the book states John Wayne supposedly called Jewison a "pinko Canadian."  Also not to mention a few other things I found offensive.  I put the book back on the shelf, kept looking and wound up buying "Capote," about the life of Truman Capote.  He was a Southerner, a writer, hob-nobbed with the rich and famous, and on the back book cover it said he had a feud with Gore Vidal.  Home run. 
 The title implies far more than you'll get from this "book".  In reality it is 18 fairly small pages of generic information such as "ensure that the board is dealing with board topics".   As a free pamphlet given away at the SBA it would be fine, but not for the money asked.  
 we built this city, me and pa. It took like 2 hours and we had pieces left over. that was probably the worst set I've put together in a long time. That guy is the champion. Oh comma by the way comma Tampora is bad. Mow the Lawn. Mogollon 
 I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed.  I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't."  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother.      
 Williamson seemed to be coasting--just slapping this story together  without really putting any serious effort into it. The hackneyed plot was a rehash of the elements of many plots in books I have read over the last 50 years--nothing new or exciting.  The characters were never really developed to the point that I cared about what happened to them. Definitely not a page turner 
 apparently there is an error in the item description. these are not gore-tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive. I new they probably were not waterproof when I put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway... stupid me. 
 As a former hospital chaplain, mental health therapist, and one-time patient, I am greatly put off by the author's assumptions and arrogance concerning group therapy.  His attempts to "bring out" and "socialize" Highly Sensitive Personalities, Introverts and those with Schizo-social disorders borders on criminal.  Starting with p.231, the author spins a rather slanted bias in favor of extroversion, brashly assuming that introverted patients need "fixed" if they are to be productive and happy in a group therapy environment.  Such gross insensitivity and ignorance is unfortunate, misleading, and inexcusable in a scholarly text such as this. 
 Saddam was a horrible tyrant, there is no doubt about that. But I dont think many Americans have the right to say that. We supported Saddam all through the 8o's even after he gassed his own people. Now, we are waging a war to get rid of him and try him for war crimes. How do we do that? We commit a war crime, aggression, and kill 20,000 iraqi civilians to get rid of him. Funny how we are trying him for a crime he committed in the 80's considering afterwards we supported his regime. 
 Without religion it would be easy to see good men doing good things and bad men doing bad things.  With religion bad men can do bad things and justify those things under the guise of religion.  However good men can also do bad things behind the same religion.  Here we have a fine example of either.  You can pick which man you see here.  Whichever way you go it does not remove the fact that BAD things have been done.  That is the message of this book 
 Hey everyone! Lookit me!  I'm a rich little snot and I can throw a big party in my mansion!  What's "great" about this Gabsty fellow exactly?  Write something about people who work for a living, not this junk.  I didn't like this one little bit, sorry.  Try again.  Only one star for your book, sir 
 This toy was so frustrating, the pieces wouldn't snap together properly and it was messy and my son ended up walking away from it he was so fed up.   This was after a half an hour of me attempting to make the pieces fit together properly.  In the end, it looked like a pile of cloudy lime Jello with plastic bones sticking out of it.  I would not reccomend this toy 
 The story is not very interesting.  The book has too much discription of the furniture in the house and not enough of a story line.  I wanted to read more about ghosts and Lena's supernatural powers.  This is a typical  coming of age story with one or two ghost stories thrown in.  I was truly  disappointed 
 When the internal rechargable battery dies so does the unit. The power cord will not power the shaver once the battery can no longer hold a charge.   You cannot replace the regargable battery yourself! Sending the unit for factory repair after its warranty will cost you more than buying a new one. As for the shave: not bad, but not exceptional either. The cutters a very tiny, not built to last, and are not durable. All rechargable batteries have a limited life depening on conditions on how they are used. This shaver may last you a few months - a year, 2 to 3 years will be a stretch.  I also have a braun and a norelco, the norelco is 10years old and running fine, the braun is 15 years - both have original cutters and foil - I heavy duty clean them in 97% alchohol about once a year, and brush out debris about once every 7 uses, these units dont have batteries and this is why I purchased the remington to have acess when there is no power plug available. The Remington shaver really needs to have it's cutter blades cleaned (brushed off or washed) after every use (what a Pain)! I find this shaver to be a waste of money as it is more akin to being a disposable electric shaver - than one that will last 
 This book has 30 pages of obvious and worthless information. The book is very thin; when the box from Amazon arrived I looked in the box and almost didn't find the book, that's how thin it is. Of course it is quality not quantity that matters, and there too this book falls short. It was not written by a psychologist, in fact the educational qulifications of the author are not revealed. He is a "management consultant to churches." The average web page has more information than this book. Definitely not worth the price 
 I just wasted $16.35 on this piece of junk.  It arrived quickly, and became unusable even faster.  For those of you used to disposable screen covers, there is only one in this package!  The instructions say you can clean it, but it came out of the packaging with lint on it, which immediately adhered to the sticky side, and could not be cleaned off.    Since the package was opened, it could not be returned.  
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 I purchased this book because I am interested in environmental issues and I saw a favorable newspaper review.  I found Ms. Royte's style so rambling, long-winded, and anecdotal that it was difficult to stay focussed for the kernels of real information that occasionally popped up.  And now I feel badly for the energy wasted and trees harvested on account of my purchase. 
 This book is cerainly a disgrace for BRS in general. Unlike the beautiful Biochemistry and Physiology BRS, this Anatomy book is really a disaster at least reputation wise for the BRS.  Yu don't believe me, just buy it and you will NOT want to study from it.  The most crucial thing in Anatomy is a good diagram, but there are few diagrams and they are horrible anyways 
 I echo the first review with my dissapointment of this product. The instructions list different parts than are packaged in the box so you are unable to put together the clock tower properly. The pieces don't match the colors on the box cover or the instructions so you are unable to attempt to put it together in spite of the tiny little pictures on the instructions. We have to many pieces of the wrong shapes so the clock tower is going back to the store. We will encourage our children to select something different at the toy store. And don't look for help on their web site, most of the forums are not open for viewing because they are not approved! The forum is also not easy to find. Magnetix needs to work on their quality control and customer service 
 This book appears to have a lot of helpful information in it, but there are a lot of gaps. It takes a subject and touches the tip of every iceberg, but leaves way too much information out and assumes way too much knowledge on the user's part. The photos of the projects are horrid; just barely ledgible and convey no real information about what each step is trying to accomplish. The section on superimpostion is a hash of jargon and half formed concepts. Useful if you can get it cheap, but otherwise save your dough 
 It's about time for someone to make a strong pitch to Hollywood for a new version of "Fahrenehit 451".  Although I appreciate what Truffault was trying to accomplish back in the sixties, the movie just does not hold up well in 2007, particularly when shown in a high school classroom.  Advancements in CGI could transform Bradbury's novel into a very frightening and exciting thriller.  My students spent more time laughing at the adaptation than appreciating it thematically.  That being said, the book gained value exponentially to them because the movie didn't satisfy their understanding.  Lose the wires on the jet packs! 
 Judith Newman's memoir of becoming a first-time mother of twins in her early forties is more than light reading, but much less than it could have been. Newman writes well, she's funny and, yes, she's honest, but SELECTIVELY honest -- for one thing, how does a freelance writer, even for top-shelf magazines and newspapers, come by those tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars she almost casually strews everywhere in pursuit of Manhattan real estate, nannies, baby clothes and all the other accoutrements of modern living? You get the feeling that there is a lot she's not telling you.   Newman, a dyed-in-the-wool urban sophisticate who moves easily among Manhattan's media elite, is good at what she does and is nobody's fool. She is well trained to see all glasses as half-empty, and this is one media professional who turns a gimlet eye on the media; parents' magazines, kids' TV (save for 'Sesame Street' and 'Mister Rogers'), and even 'Goodnight Moon' come in for a pasting. Would that her critical judgment was as finely honed where her personal life is concerned. This book, amusing and a page-turner though it is, turns into a classic illustration of Smart Women, Foolish Choices. By the end of the book, you wonder why on earth she's stayed with her superannuated, selfish jerk of a husband (one wonders what his reaction was when he read his wife's extremely unflattering depiction of him, that is, if he bothered to read the book at all), not to mention the controlling Jamaican nanny (whose sister she hired for the twins' first three months at $250 a day!), not to mention her judgment in keeping a golden retriever in a cramped Manhattan apartment, even after the twins were born. Then again, perhaps Newman and her husband are more compatible than even she likes to admit -- her fundamentally self-indulgent nature comes through on every page.  Paradoxically, Newman, while she ably satirizes the schadenfreude-filled, absurdly competitive, ridiculously expensive lives of her peers, is unable to avoid falling into the same traps herself. This limits the sympathy you feel for her, even as it increases the sympathy you feel for her two boys (by far the most affectionately drawn individuals in the book).  The diary format,  which divides the 306-page book into easily digestible little clumps, is reader-friendly but ultimately limiting. There is no real conclusion; instead, it just limps to a close arbitrarily (publishers' deadlines, you know). You lament that she's still with her frequently absent husband, with THAT nanny, even still waiting for the renovation of her 'extra' apartment to be completed.   As a recent first-time father of twins, I find the ring of the familiar in much of what Newman writes of her children. However, most of America, let alone the world, lives in a far different reality than the author of this book, who has confirmed for me, once again, that the people who live in Manhattan are among the most screwed-up folk on the face of the earth. (As a native New Yorker, I'm entitled to say this.)  
 The 1 star is for the historical aspect of this book. Some very interesting info, especially on the early history of gold many thousands of years ago. But the recent history (late 1800's up to late 1990's) is so skewed that I almost could not finish it. It's ironic that Mr. Bernstein refers to gold on so many occasions as basically a useless piece of metal while extoling the virtues of paper currencies (mainly the Dollar) as the savior of the civilized world. To put it into perspective, that useless yellow metal, in the 6 years since the printing of this book has increased in value (measured by dollars) almost 140% (gold = $620/oz recently) while the greenbacks in my wallet have LOST 15% of their value in the same time. Gold doesn't pay any dividends but it holds its value a whole lot better than the constantly inflated dollar.     It's also interesting how the move to confiscate U.S. citizens gold in 1933 by FDR is glossed over and made to look almost as if it were a good thing. Yet no where is it mentioned that since that day the U.S dollar has decreased in value by 97% !!!! AND that the average income tax rate for the American worker has exploded in order to fund mushrooming government programs, U.S. public debt is well over 10 trillion dollars, the government debt is close to 15 trillion dollars and our trade deficit is approaching a trillion dollars! Meanwhile while China, India and Russia continue to add to their gold holdings, we continue to add to our debt, a debt that our childrens' children will not even be able to pay off. Gold kept us disciplined. Now, we are awash in debt and dollars. The dollar continues to fall while gold continues to hold it's value relative to it.     Remember that no fiat currency has ever lasted. Gold has and always will. I would like to see a follow up book with possibly a new chapter entitled "Got Gold?". 
    The author of the review "Bad" could not have been more on-target. (And now I will proceed to be similarly lambasted by those of you who deem my articulate review "unhelpful" simply because I don't agree with you that this book will solve all of the world's problems. Thus, since I write negative reviews AS WELL AS positive ones, I will certainly never challenge anyone's "Top 100 reviewer" status.... but that's another story; I digress...)        This book is a jumbled cacophony of lists, adages, and "how-to" advice; all with no inherent interconnection, and limited usefulness in practical terms. I, like other reviewers, was only reading it as it was required reading for an online law enforcement course I was taking (I am a cop). Therefore I felt the need to warn those of you who are actually contemplating the voluntary reading of this book for purposes of enhancing your career.        I notice of course the flowery praise from other reviewers. This is somewhat unexplainable to me. All I can think of is that we as a people (admirably) are more likely to comment on something we feel positive about, than the opposite. And don't get me wrong, if this book helps you in some way, or you feel it has effective information to suit your needs, then by all means, I am not knocking your experience. Certainly there is SOME amount of helpful info to be gleaned here (thus the 2 stars instead of one!). It just seemed like overall, you are just being given an "information dump", with little coherence or style to speak of.        Additionally, many of the concepts and actual phrases are taken DIRECTLY from US military doctrine, as well as the actual leadership publications. At times this is appropriately noted and referenced, but other times it is not. (I spent 9 years in the Army, and some of the terms and phrases the author uses are VERY familiar, believe me!)        The real-world examples and anecdotes are few, and lackluster, and the author is quick to jump back into his ingrained style of dumping on you more maxims and formulas (some of these are so clicheed as to be almost PAINFUL to read, especially if you have read a few self-development books in the past). In the end one is left with the impression, "I could have written this book!"       Also the review would not be complete without noting the gratuitous and sometimes ghastly grammatical errors. They are all there folks: misspellings, syntax errors, usage issues, incomplete sentences, the works. I am not an English major, but come on, isn't someone supposed to review this stuff before publication? If you have read a few books in your life (not saying you need to be Einstein) you will surely find all the grammatical flaws distracting- and, admittedly, a bit disheartening from a man trying to "teach" me something.       Like I said, if you get something out of this book, my hat's off to you. Personally I found it dry, formulaic, and almost completely UN-helpful. There HAS to be better books on leadership out there! Wait... I'll recommend one right of the bat: try to get your hands on Army Field Manual 22-100, "Military Leadership". You'll find great historical examples, practical applications (to the military, though, not police work), and you may be surprised to find some of the same information as in Baker's book! (Minus all the grammatical errors though).  
 If an author choses to write a politcally charged novel, there will be bias. What I look for is some balance in the arguments. But, like his brother Rush, David writes with blinders on and misses the obvious contradictions in his arguments. The Democrats are not like Republicans! Of course not. The current Republican party is overwhelmingly an ideological, lock-step plutocratic mob who won't tolerate open discussion of an issue. Democrats on the other hand are diverse, open minded and welcoming of new ideas and thoughts. David Limbaugh would have you believe that is chaos. Open, intelligent discussions are what is missing in the Republican party right now.  A book does not have to be well written to put across the author's theme, and the ideas he is promoting, but when it is dully written, poorly researched and obvious in its misinterpretation of issues and situations it is difficult to give it much credence.  Basically I have read this book before, several times. There is nothing new, in fact it sounds like a few days of Rush on the radio, usually wrong and overwhelmingly insulting to anyone who can think for themself.  So, all I see here is an poorly written dull diatribe of the same old propaganda from the right - "Don't confuse us with the facts we already have been told what to think." 
 Despite several contacts with the publisher, I couldn't get the test engine to work.  And to add icing on the cake it corrupted some of the software on my computer.  If you try this product be sure that if you don't backup your drive, then at least set a restore point.  Good Luc 
 Acting: forget it. Story: Ludacrous. However the production design (sets, the puppet, killer mechanisms) and the cinematography are worth mentioning - although I can tell you now that the stylish overall look of this film will seem awfully dated in a dozen of years.  I'm giving this film 2 stars: one for the efforts of the production design team, the other one is to be shared by the marketing heads of the studio, the editor who cut one hell of a good trailer together and the graphic designer(s) who are responsible for the layouts of all promo material.  
 O.K., so I'm paying $300 for a set-top box with a 40Gb hard drive, but I can't use it as a DVR? Why not? Also, the only content I can play on this set-top box is content that comes through iTunes? That's right. if it isn't in your iTunes library, you can play it on the Apple TV. This means you caqn play your DVD's, you cant't play saved DVD, iMovie, or other movie files, you can't play anything unless it has been successfully;y added to your iTunes library. Also, make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV. they aren't joking about this. If you don't have one, you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen (it won't go to the edges and be borderless) so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box.   Any pros? It has to be the easiest setup I have ever experienced with an electronic item. I mean less than 5 minutes and I was set. also, I thought it was really coll that with zero configuring on my part, it was able to communicate perfectly with iTunes  just because I plugged the Apple TV into my Airport Extreme router that my computer was also plugged into. basically, Apple TV saw this is a direct link. I didn't think it would be that easy without having to configure something, but it was. Also the menus are very helpful and attractive. This will be a good product down the line when this will have a larger hard drive and DVR capability. Right now it's time to sell this one on ebay and wait a few years for something better. if this had only cost me $100 or $150 I would probably keep it, however. $300 is too much for too little 
 Men of a certain age will remember how, when we were kids and this was played on TV in the early 80s, we thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed, and when a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops.  But those two over-the-top scenes are all this movie has going for it.    The other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable, especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter, and atop a parking structure, both of whom were in "can't miss" positions and missed anyway.    Moreover, if you know anything about law the plot is beyond silly.  It involves Eastwood being sent from Phoenix to Las Vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to Arizona for a trial.  The witness will testify about bad behavior on the part of the Phoenix police commissioner, and a corrupt assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in a coverup.  Assuming a material witness can be extradited, which I doubt, the crime appears to have been committed in Vegas, so it would tried in Vegas, not Phoenix.  And if the ADA prosecuting the case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner, he could just dismiss the case, and there would be no need to murder the witness.  The idea that they would want to draw attention to the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the witness is beyond ridiculous.    In sum, the plot and the action were both absurd,and the only interesting scenes were the crazy firepower overkill at the house and on the bus.  But those two scenes probably can't carry the entire movie for the average viewer.    
 I used to buy this off the shelf each month, but last November, my wife bought me a subscription.   I bought the December issue,...cause it hadn't arrived by mail yet. No problem.  In January, I received the November issue.   A few weeks later, in early February, I received the December issue, but not the January, so I went out and bought the January.   By the end of February, still hadn't received the Feb yet, so bought it.  Then, received the January issue and a few weeks later the February.   I was fed up.   I know they were getting 'caught up', but not only was I getting editions that I'd already bought off the shelf, but I figured these were counting against my 12 issues.     I cancelled.  They deducted a few bucks from my refund for "issues received" and had no apologies for the mess.  I like the magazine, but I will say that if you read it over time, it become redundant.   The suggested work-outs are mostly rehashes of past work-out routines.  Lets face it...there are only so many ways to work out and when you get right down to it, you gotta hit it hard and often, change things up, etc...bla bla bla...   The BEST part of the magazine are the few pages they dedicate to the correct way to execute a lift or detail what muscles are hit.   Lots of Weider ads...but then its a Weider publication, so what can you expect...  I'd buy it off the shelf because you'll eventually get tired of the same old thing...and their subscription program is iffy.  - 
 I have to make is that I understand. I am not understanding of why this is reccommendEd(CAn a racist person keep this to themselves?) though. Yes this is thought of as National socialist Black MetAl. The Extra stAr is BecaUse a Person Can Change, and Is the Victim, saVe whEn tHeir Alone, Of thEir CircUmStaNcEs.Someone once said the racist beliefs were not in this Music, that he kept them seperAte.He aLso Liked Dead Can Dance. Not a Racist Band. Perhaps a lIsten will garner a better rEview. HE's also not alive to defend himself 
 Neil, I've listened to you since 1979, seen you play 35 shows, and have turned on about 300 of my acquaintances to Rush in the past 27 years. I played in a band that played Rush songs as 85% of our show. And I even modeled my kit after yours several times.If I had known you hated fans the way you do, I would have stopped seeing you play years ago. You complain about people too much! You speak too prophetically about all the great things you've done, and the tragedies bestowed upon you, yet you put religion down and make fun of people as if you haven't learned a single lesson. Not all drummers never grow up. I'm a drummer, and it takes serious concentration to be a good person with little judgement, than it does to play paradiddles and ratamacues.Lighten up, dude! If you don't like touring and you only do it for the money to "pay your bills," then get a job cleaning motorcycles and make yourself useful. Here's a church sign for you: "God permits U-turns, unless you're Neil Peart."  It sucks that your so talented, but you could use a little schoolin' in the human being department. The only thing that kept me reading is my disbelief that you could be such an incredible arse 
 I would have to agree with the majority of assessment of this product on Amazon: this product fails on every count. 1.	Most significantly, product does not perform as described.  Signal strength not "significantly improved."  In fact, no change in reception at all.  I have used this in my one-story home and in a café I work at with no effect whatsoever. 2.	When there is a rebate, it is more trouble than it is work.  [... 
 Yo Gotti in the past can spit some raw ish but on this one, I dunno what happpened.....The production seemed too generic, the rapping was pretty average and generic and not that impressive at all, and doesnt carry much replay value....To be honest, id pop in a Three 6  Mafia cd rather than this one....Album was slacking on so many levels, now theres some tracks that listenable, but the rest make it hard to enjoy this album, nothin special bout it at all...This album waz overhyped I believe and flopped horribly.......Gotti can do much better than this.....Wouldnt recommend anyone to chek it out.....  2.5/ 
 Bag was well made, but too small.  Can't put much in it.  Nice well-made leather bag.  If it was three times bigger it would be a perfect. 
 I love blueberries, both fresh and dried, but these have sugar added which makes them far too sweet for my taste.  Dried fruit is always naturally sweet, added sweeteners just turn them into pure candy, instead of a naturally healthy snack.  Thumbs down for this one 
 Although Healy seems to be in support of technology in education, she chooses to present only the worst case scenarios in her book and takes a very pessimistic view of educational technology.  She visits several  schools, both in low and high economic areas, and seems to find all of the  worst examples of computers being used with students.  For example, she  observes a group of students using 2 computers to do writing, and tells  only of those who appear to be wasting time, not of those who are being  successful.  She criticizes the activity and calls it a waste of time.  At  the same time, she quotes teachers saying things like "Isn't it great  what they can do with the computer?" which then makes the teacher look  like she doesn't know what is going on.   	It is true that often times  parents and teachers don't use computers to their fullest potential, but  spending an entire book pointing out all of the faults is not the way to  change people's ways.  The problem essentially falls on the software  manufacturers who see a profitable market in "edutainment"  software. To Healy's credit, she gives several different suggestions for  parents when they are buying software for their children at home and  suggests ways to use the techonolgy as a tool, not as a substitute for the  television.   	Instead of pointing out everything that is wrong with  technology in schools, Healy and others like her would be better served  looking for what is right and working to make these good practices  available to those who need it most 
 SIMPLY PUT, WORDS FAIL ME AS I STRIVE TO PURVEY THE SENSE OF FLOW I GET FROM THIS BOOK; AKIND TO MOLASSES IN THE WINTER.A BIT MORE HEAT TO THE MIX WOULD HAVE WET MY PALATE FOR THIS MUDANE LITERARY EXPERIENC 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 This book is just a clever rehash of his other books but just repackaged under "POWER AGING". Some of his books contain the title Gary Null Phd. and other books just say Gary Null- so this time it is "Phd"- the book jackets NEVER say from what University. Many of the supplements pluged in Null's book are sold by his company Gary Null Associates so it is hard not to look at this book as just another product placement. The idea that hundreds of  millions of people of diverse cultures should eat a specific way is ludicrous. Gary Null writes his book as if he has all the information, but scientists still do not have much of the answers regarding aging, yet Gary gives the impression he knows everything there need to know about health and mega- antioxidants may become pro-oxidants in the body. He sounds like the Jim Jones of health gurus. Gary Null knows that his diet is nearly impossible to follow for the normal average person working 8 to 6 pm 5 or 6 days a week and he creates products that fill the need. Instead of eating all those lbs. of organic vegetables and fruit each day just take his expensive concentrates and supplements and watch Gary Inc. get richer. CASE IN POINT: FOR OVER 30 YEARS GARY CLAIMED THAT CHOCOLATE WAS TOXIC AND AS BAD AS CONSUMING MEAT OR COFFEE-NOW HE SELLS A 'NUTRITIOUS" GARY NULL CHOCOLATE BAR!   
 I just took a week-long trip to New Mexico and gave up using this book after the first day.  I found my free AAA New Mexico Tourbook far more complete and informative 
 The book is pretty and has a bit of useful information, but definitely not what I was looking for.  You can get most of the information on the internet anyway.  Save your money 
 "The Broadway Melody" was the movie that won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1928, which means this movie is officially older then my grandma. Now the funny thing about the Academy Awards is that is was created to add sophistication to movies. Some people were beginning to wonder whether or not films were healthy for people, whether or not they were morally corrupt, and whether or not movies could be considered art (and this was seventy years BEFORE the world was a witness to "South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut"). So the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences was created, along with the Academy Awards, to help make films more respectable. Watching "The Broadway Melody" today with this history in mind is a revelation, as this film doesnt really support the fact that movies could be considered art AND entertainment! Now, Im going to try and put myself in 1928's shoes while I describe reasons I think this film won.  This was the first musical to be filmed. It was a major box office hit, making a little bit more then $4 million dollars. It was the first movie to have a scene in Technicolor (though using only two colors). And for all the techniques this film helped create, for all the firsts this film had, watching it today feels like watching a dinosaur worse then Barney. The movie just feels OLD! The storyline involves two sisters who are both dancers, who go to New York to become Broadway stars. Along the way there will be trials, tribulations, and jealousy spouts. This is really all there is to the story, as the musical numbers are always the center of attention for this film. There will be long scenes of musical numbers, followed by two minutes of dialog, followed by ten minutes of dancing, followed by three minutes of dialog, and so forth. In total, there is maybe thirty-five minutes of actual story in this movie, hardly worth debating in my case.  What is worth debating are the dance sequences. Now, I understand this was the first musical filmed, but that doesnt quite explain all the poor camera shots. During musical numbers the camera will pick a spot to film, and stay there the entire scene. Never mind if the dancers are moving, the camera stays still. There are scenes where the dancers will dance off camera, and the camera will star at an empty stage for a couple of minutes before the dancers come back. Sometimes the camera is in such a poor position, that we cant really see whats going on. There is one musical sequence that is shot from overhead, and I cant figure out what is going on since this sequence in a TAP DANCING sequence! Brilliant, they decide they want to have a tap dancing scene, so they put the camera in a place where you cant even see the dancers feet. Why, why did the director think this was a great idea? Even though I have eighty years worth of movies to benefit me in my experience, didnt the director feel scenes like this looked just a LITTLE funny back then?!  Back in 1928? Maybe the director was thinking of how he would watch a Broadway show in the audience, where you got to your seat, and for the whole production you basically saw the show from one point of view. I dont know if this was what the director was thinking, but I do know that even in the audience of a live show I have the ability to turn my head at the very least. Viewing problems aside, there isnt really anything to like about the movie nowadays. The acting, like most acting in the old days, is severally melodramatic and wildly overblown, where even simple things as asking for a cup of coffee is often shouted with exaggerated body motions that follow. I cant say any of the music is really all that catchy anymore, and if I were you I wouldnt be expecting a craving to get the soundtrack when the movie is over.  All in all, it's interesting to see where the movie musical got its start, but it feels like such a fossil these days. 
 Similiar to the other reviews, the control panel on the face does not work.  Both the up and down volume controls actually lower the volume.  Also the "source" button does not work so you can not pre-set any FM stations.  Also the select button only works occassionally.  I have never, ever had so many problems with an electronic piece of equipment.  Such a waste of time and effort to buy this, bring it to my office, and now to have to bring it back home and then return it.  Save your self the effort.  Sound is great, but so what if nothing else works.  Disappointing 
 I made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely. The lens is for a variety of Canon cameras but the adapter only works with the A6XX series. My adapter arrived and it doesn't work with my camera. Kinda misleading and now I have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately. Bummer.  Also, Captain Jack is correct about the vignetting. This lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built-in zoom lens. If you zoom wide angle, you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned. If you stay zoomed in, it works ok. Disappointing 
 50 cent is one of the worst rappers to hit a recording studio almost as bad as Webbie. I see some people wrote "I bet people did not even listen to the album they just heard the singles and thought it was soft". Well i listened to the whole album and my IQ dropped 83 points it was that retarded of an album. The only reason this sells is because white people think their cool when blasting this in their vehicles. I will never purchase a G Unit affiliated album ever again even if I like the artist because I know 50 will be on it. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! 
 The back of the novel said that the author bought $1,500 worth of heroin, and started to shoot up 10 times a day. I guess her attempts to "feel" the story didn't work, because this is the worse book about Heroin I've ever read. It was so unrealistic I couldn't believe it. I've met 5 year olds less nieve than the main character. This book was terrible, and I regret wasting my time to read it.  I guess I should have listened to what some of the reviews said, I thought people were exagerating when they said the book stunk. They weren't lying 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 I found no mention of Harry Ferguson, the Ford-Ferguson tractor(perhaps the most significant agricultural tractor of the Twentieth Century), or subsequent tractor work by Ford.  There was no mention of Dearborn Motors, nor its significance to the Company 
     The editor of this volume of collected essays,U Maki,made the mistake of republishing an error filled paper of J.Runde that originally appeared as an invited paper in The Monist(1995).Runde corrected several of his errors regarding Frank Knight,but none of his errors regarding John Maynard Keynes.Runde's essay is then used ,implicitly and/or explicitly,by the other essay authors whenever issues about Keynes and probability,decision making,rationality,expectations,etc.,arises as an issue in their essays.Runde's major error is that he bases his entire discussion of Keynes's approach to the quantification and measurement of probabilities  on chapters 3  and 4 of Keynes's A Treatise on Probability(1921;TP).This is precisely the same error made by Frank P. Ramsey, in 1922 and 1926, in two error filled reviews  of Keynes's book that Bertrand Russell correctly described as having the least value of any paper written by Ramsey during his brief lifetime(1903-1930).In chapter 3 of the TP,p.37,Keynes warns the reader that his approach to the measurement and quantification of estimating probabilities would not be completed until after Part II of the TP had been finished.In chapter 15(pp.160-163) and chapter 17(p.186-194)of his TP,Keynes makes it crystal clear that by the terms "nonnumerical" and "nonmeasurable" he means not by a single numeral(number)but by TWO numerals.Keynes is the founder of the interval approach to probability.This is directly contrary to Runde's claim that Keynes's theory is strictly a qualitative (comparative)approach involving the use of ordinal rankings,combined with some very special cases of numerical measurement involving frequencies and applications of  Keynes's principle of indifference.This would make Keynes's theory inoperative in the real world of actual decision making.Fortunately,Ramsey and Runde are wrong.For Keynes,it is the intervals themselves,if they overlap in any way, which are incomparable,nonrankable,and incommensurable.A simple example is to take the two probability interval estimates [.3,.5] and [.4,.6].These two probabilities can't be ranked or compared.They are "nonnumerical" probabilities.Runde wastes the reader's time by presenting diagrams purporting to represent intervals without the use of any numbers. This conception has absolutely nothing to do with the approach to probability estimation presented in 1921 by Keynes in his TP.We can now summarise Keynes's approach. All probabilities are either point estimates ,involving single numbers, or they are interval estimates, involving two numbers.These latter proabilities can be called nonadditive,imprecise or indeterminate probabilities,as long as the Bayesian interpretation of imprecise is not imputed to Keynes.In chapter 26 of the TP,Keynes incorporated his interval estimate approach into a method for technically dealing with expectations and decision theory.Keynes presented his conventional coefficient of risk and weight,c.The goal of the decision maker is to maximize cA,as opposed to pA,expected value or pU(A),expected utility.c=p(1/(1+q)[2w/(1+w)].Both c and w,which measures the completeness of the potential and actual amount of relevant evidence upon which the decision maker will base his calculation of an estimated probability,are normalized on the unit interval [0,1].Naturally,one will obtain a lower bound and an upper bound when using the c coefficient formula.This would then lead to a "nonnumerical" weighted value and/or "nonnumerical" mathematical expectation or expected value.All of this ,however,is omitted in both Ramsey and Runde.The lesson to be learned is that papers should be carefully examined for errors by editors before they are accepted for publication.The only possible reason for purchasing this book would be if a potential reader wanted to compare the original 1995  Runde article with Runde's 2001 contribution in this volume and see if any learning from experience has occurred.My own opinion is that the reader would be better off just reading chapters 15 and 17 of the TP 
 Volume 1 (this book) was released a long long time ago and the advanced topics that were supposed to be covered in Volume 2 has never been addressed.  Volume 2 has been delayed at least 4 times already - all after the editor's gleaming comments had been made!  What does this say about the authors and publisher?  What it tells me is you are not important.  Why does it tell me that?  Who has a project or an employer that will let you wait a year after learning the absolute basics ("Hello World!") before requiring that you be capable of something more?  NONE!  These authors and publisher have made it so that you now have to get the advanced topics somewhere else and just hope that the other author has written the book to compliment Volume 1 of this book from these authors.  Not likely.  They made me have to basically switch bridges in mid-stream.  I do not know what their problem is but this is a sad sad way to do your customers.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!  Find another author/publisher who has both an introductory book and an advanced book already published.  It is an easy thing to find for 1.4.x of J2EE 
 I too just received my Petite Casserole in white too.  I thought after reading that many others got white by mistake that the problem would be corrected.  I am returning my "white" casserole and hope that I will be able to get the "red" one that I ordered. 
 Where's the subtitle of this very effective book?  Did the modern editors simply take it away?  Darwin titled his book: "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" and subtitled it: "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."  When Hitler came to power in 1933, he had one overarching idea in mind: his radical Nazi racial philosophy built on the Darwinian principle of natural selection.  Hilter thought the Aryans were the fittest and he wanted to help speed up the "inevitability" of natural selection.  He first started off with the sterilization of nine categories of "the unfit" which were feebleminded, schizophrenia, manic depression, Huntington's chorea, epilepsy, hereditary body deformities, deafness, hereditary blindness and alcoholism.  He then worked his way up to attempting the complete extermination of entire categories and entire races of people.  Speaking of modern day little Hitlers, the Columbine High School shooters carried out their bloody rampage on Hilter's birthday, April 20th, and had planned on causing more than 500 deaths at the high school.  Shooter Eric Harris had written on his website, "YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE??? Natural SELECTION!  It's the best thing that ever happened to the Earth.  Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms."  After the bloody rampage, Harris' autopsy report revealed that he was wearing a T-shirt with the words "Natural Selection" emblazoned on the front.  Beware of those who hold this book dear to their hearts.  This book is not about man descending from the apes.  The ideas in this book have caused and continue to cause more deaths than any other notion in modern history 
 I just finished Scratch the Surface, my first Susan Conant book, and was very disappointed.  Perhaps Ms. Conant is more familiar with dogs, since she certainly does not do well with the two cats featured in this book.  I also found the writing to be childish and almost amateurish, more suited to children than to an adult audience.  The plot was nicely convoluted, but the writing style could have definitely been more elevated.  This is not a book I would recommend to cat mystery lovers. 
  Unfortunately, this book says more about the author than the subject. If you want a book that demonstrates a problem, illustrates a potential solution and its applications; then don't buy this. This is a very personal and hence cloudy view of the subject matter. There is some useful information in this book but it is hidden behind the grand philosophical statements or buried in the foot notes.  Has this author ever met an empirical scientist, rather than mathematicians or philosophers. Scientists love measuring things. No scientist would ask the question 'Is an apple red or green?' They would pose the question 'How much pigment (in milligrams) of each of a series of colours does each apple have?' Or in truth something far more obtuse. In fact the fuzzy logic treatment would be a bit black and white for most scientists.   I suspect that there is a great deal more to the subject that the author communicates and I felt a bit cheated that there was not more substance in this book.  Did I miss something? If I did then the book did not work to convey the subject. If I didn't then fuzzy logic is one of a myriad of tools to handle uncertainty, and thus is a small branch of probability.   
 This item has no spoken dialogue.  Disappointed... 
 I don't know if I got the same book than the other reviewers but our impressions about it are quite different. In my opinion drawings are not very clear and instructions get confusing with all this counterclock, reverse 90?, etc.  It is not that drawings are a bad thing, I have seen other books with illustrations that are actually easier to follow than photos but that is not the case of this book. Could be used in order to remind movements that you already know but forget about learning a new form from this book 
 I bought this book to help me switch from Winduhs. It's a lotta words and I later read in his New York Times column that he "types" by dictation into .. I think Dragon Naturally Speaking on a Winduhs based machine (uh hu). The book's contents could have been cut down to less than a hundred pages-- but these books are sold by the kilo anyway. He didn't really know the OS he just banged out a quick book to earn a  yep a quick buck. I read his "consumer" columns in the NYtimes and find them useful but this book wasn't. Oh yeah and the switch ...... to Mac .... over rated but OK. 
 this boat seemed like a great idea, and my 7 month baby does like it. it gets him in the water, which is fun, but i cant even take my eyes off him for one nano-second. he has fallen over the sides, he has fallen forward between the seat and tube. the seat is so small and there is so much space between it and the tube. my babys legs fit fine in the leg opening. this boat is dangerous. i am looking for a new one 
 The kids got it for Christmas, and it looked like fun.  However, the one we got doesn't work at all.  I'm not sure if we just got a bad one or if this problem is common, but I can't even get it to turn on without changing the batteries, and then I can't get it to go into the game mode.  Plus, the rules of the electronic version are different, in that you lose all your points if you keep acting out words.  I prefer the rules of the old version better.  I'm planning to return this and get the old version 
 the jewish state has no future without american taxpayer dollers. israel is a dieing tree americans giving israel water will just prolong the agony 
 This is a generic "how to feed your puppy" book with a couple of pictures of GSP's and one extra chapter devoted to the breed.  If you don't already know the information contained in the book, you have never owned a dog in your life.  Spend the extra cash on "New Complete GSP's" or "GSP's Today&quot 
 The knives are "ok". Could get just as good knives at WalMart. The warranty service is TERRIBLE! You will be saddened to know that you'll have to wait upwards of 2 months (maybe longer) to get your replacement knives. I have placed multiple phone calls to the customer service, only to state that they have not been shipped yet. (of course, the $5.00 shipping charge was IMMEDIATELY billed to my account). I would reccommend as a fellow consumer not to waste your time with these knives. Spend a few extra dollars and get a much better knife, all the meanwhile, not having to deal with the warranty/replacement "guarntee". You'll be upset. 
 I've only once put up a review on a book I disliked.  Actually I rarely write a review, but have several times in the past and usually on a book that really touched me and stood out in my mind.  This book certainly stands out so I will review it.  I absolutely hated this book!  I'm so disappointed because I was fully expecting to really enjoy it.  Not so!  As one other reviewer put it - "one mind-numbing, expletive-filled page after another" fits the book perfectly.  I kept plugging away, expecting to hook up with the book, but by page 100 I just gave it up.  A terrible disappointment.  
 I received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping. I notified Amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem. I received a credit and Amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out. Thanks Billy Lede 
 The guy has a few good ideas but, reader, beware; this is the transciption  of several different lectures over several years.  I use the term  "different" loosely because each appears to be a regurgitation of  the others.  The book desperately needs an editor, preferably one who isn't  getting paid by the page 
 I bought this as a gift for a 10 year old this christmas and her first impression was " why on Earth would you buy this book for ME?" I felt really bad when i read it myself. The author uses old paintings anyone who is into Mermaids has already seen a million times, nothing new here.. and nothing recent in terms of art! Also this book is not very large or really very informitive. It essentially brushes across the subject of Mermaids as if this was your first introduction to the subject. I didnt' learn a thing there was tons of old quotes on Mermaids all of them meaning nothing. The worst part other then the lack of real research and imagination, was that all the paintings don't have captions so if you want to know where the paintings came from, who made them and what story they are from you have to find it somewhere in the back of the book, truely annoying and unnessary. This book or any book on Mermaids could have been "oh so much more". I have no idea why it got so many high stars from people! There is I see now, Tons of wonderful books on Amazon much better then this one on mermaids dont' let your search stop here 
 We have a home inspection business and I read many books on real estate topics. This book was OK but certainly not worth recommending to our inspection clients. Some of the topics discussed are irrelevant to home inspections - such as mold! There were many topics lacking in the amount of information the author provided. Maybe if you don't know anything about houses or construction you might learn a little bit from this book. If you have a novice level of knowledge about house inspections then you should buy a different book since this book won't teach you anything new 
 For heavens sakes, how does a sappy book like this get such glowing reviews!  There are certainly some interesting plotlines and characterizations (although none of them exactly "deep"), and Jones is bold in portraying Polly's life with some stark details.  But most of the story takes place while Polly is about 14-16, and it's asking a lot for an adult to put up with the insipid voice of Polly for so long.  There are some humerous moments, and Jone's entertaining style compels the reader to keep turning the pages, but there's no satisfactory ending that makes you glad to have spent the effort reading it through.  The ending is nothing but sloppy.  It's as if the author spent all this time developing the story at a fairly plodding pace and then was told to finish it in a weekend.  Several reviewers seem to be trying to fill the gaps but frankly there's just a bunch of stuff that has no explanation whatsoever.  The ending has all the satisfaction of a Star Trek episode defeating a robot with "This statement is false", and even that is delivered about as crudely as imaginable.  Jones is better with lighter fare where she can make us laugh our way along and not expect too much of the ending, like "Dark Lord of Derkholm" or "Year of the Griffin".  But she completely overreaches in this one.  I'd have given it 3 stars if it weren't for all the overblown reviews - expectations need to be lowered in this case to counteract the hype.  I do wonder what she could have done if she'd focused more on the ending to provide a satisfactory conclusion, instead of leaving me feeling cheated 
 I really did not find this book enjoyable, in fact I gave up half-way through.  It was more confusing than funny and I could not feel any sympathy for the characters.  It was just a bunch of caricatures  idiotically fumbling their way through a meaningless life... The humor was  so far-fetched, and sometimes just too obvious, that the book never even  extracted a chuckle out of me.  I could see how some people might enjoy it,  it did have a lot of extravagance, arrogance and simple lunacy in it... but  it did not work for me 
 This CD and the one entitled" Night Ranger's Greatest Hits are almost identical, but are different in this way:  "Best" contains "I Did It For Love". "Greatest" contains, instead, "Rumours In The Air" and "Restless Kind". The other 10 tracks on each CD are the same. So, which one to buy? My choice is the one with the extra track. Also, in my opinion, both tracks on "Greatest" are better than the one on "Best".  In addition, here's hoping that the band or record label decides to release a true "Greatest Hits" or "Best Of" album that will contain about 15 or 16 songs. Or maybe a multi-disc compilation that will include some rare tracks.   Night Ranger fans would surely delight to see something like that 
 Dumb book, too borring. Better off reading "The Rules", much more entertaining 
 This book is extremely basic.  I would only recommend it for those who have very little knowledge of baseball.  It spends a lot of time covering basic rules of tee ball and does not cover the fundamentals in enough detail to be of any use.  If you have ever played baseball then this book is not for you 
 I've seen ethan hawk's best performance ever in this movie. it was great. Wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie. it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, this movie does not worth to buy. does not even worth to rent. but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally. It's worth to be watch once at TV! By the way, I forgot to mention that this movie has a great CD soundtrack, really great. worth to buy 
 The game has a nice concept, IF IT WORKED. I've been trying since christmas(over 3 months) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today. Something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds,BUT THE WEB SITE IS ALWAYS DOWN!!!!! EXPERANCING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS!!!  and the nice window that pop's up on the home page from the Chief, asking for suggestions goes to a bad link!!!   I only gave it 1 star because the review process doesn't have a 0 stars.  DON'T WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS THING!!!! 
  What happened to the band that recorded "Hot Fuss"?  What happened to the electro-dance charged, hi-energy rock-poppy group that recorded "Somebody told me" and "Mr. Brightside"?  I remember in the press this band was hailed as the best British rock band to come from America.  This is definitely not the same band.  This group sounds like the E-Street band fronted by Robert Smith.  If you liked their last album, pass on this one.  If you dig more "adult-contempory" stuff, this may be right up your alley.  Not the worst album I've ever heard, but thank god for P2P (limewire/Kazaa/Bittorrent) else I may have been sukered into buying this one.  If you like the electro-dance punk sound go check out a band called "The Faint".  They'll pick up where this once-great band left off.   As a side note, Mr. Flowers has a fantastic voice on the last album.. Theres some real studio magic going on there.. I saw them live and that guy sounds terrible 
 The DVD for "The Golden Coach" is for the most part fine, but the final minutes, which are crucial to the full impact of the film, are ruined by deplorable mastering. The scene appears to be out of focus and the colors are washed out to the point of barely being able make out what is happening. I believe Criterion made some kind of mastering error, because Martin Scorsese's introduction to the film explicitly refers to the wonderful restored ending of the film. Criterion should withdraw the DVD and offer a replacement 
 I used the first edition of this book as a graduate student in my econometrics class. The book is very confusing and hard to understand. It's still of no help to me now that I am a professor and writing research paper. Whenever I need a review in econometrics I use Judge et all; "The Theory and practice of econometrics." It is a better book, well written, and easy to follow. Unfortunately it is off print. We need a better book than the one by Greene. If it was for me, this book should be put where it belongs, in the garbage 
 Being a long-time Nancy Drew collector, I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. I've read a lot of the 'tart-noir' wacky-gal mystery series, and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy, ditzy gal who just can't seem to get it all together, hunky boyfriend, obsession with glamorous flashy clothes, the need to keep secrets from the police, and on and on. But Cece Caruso just doesn't come off with any realism to me. She's too over-the-top, and she's not even a good detective. By her own admission, over and over throughout the book, she keeps missing the point, and the clues, and everything else that would lead her to understand what's going on and solving the mystery.  Cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about Carolyn Keene, the author of the Nancy Drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters. There is a lot of Nancy Drew collecting info in this story that was, for the most, taken from some speculative fan-made guides, honored by some collectors as The Truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world. It also seems the author made up some of her own. Her depiction of Nancy Drew collectors at their annual convention in Palm Springs is really unflattering. Believe me, they are not the strange, nerdy, boring people she makes them out to be. For some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel.  It's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about Nancy Drew collecting and Nancy Drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that Cece just doesn't 'get'. Her obsessions with vintage clothes, gourmet foods, alcoholic beverages, art, and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting, but she and her gang need more characterization, and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable.  Nancy Drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed. It's less about Nancy and more about Cece and friends and how 'hot' and 'cool' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are. Let's hope the next author who takes on the Nancy Drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment 
 This book is a joke.Ms.Brown is being portrayed as a innocent bambi in the Hollywood hills.Spare me! OJ's defence team should have let the evidence & facts do the talking.The facts-Nicole had party-people,like Cato Calin,hanging around and consuming things.She had a lavish monthly allowance,such as $4,000 per month ,for eating expenses,for herself and the two children.)That's alot pasta!  She had instructed some hanger-ons to leave and not to return.After another evening out, at the Mezza-Luna Ristorante ,and again she leaves her sunglasses (a code to Ron Goldman,it's play-time!)Ron Goldman knew exactly how to get to Nicole's place,as if it was routine.Ron told his boss,"He'll run it(the glasses)right over to her."(He's a liebermann or a liebknecht,really).I'm asuming after his workday.Evidence-Now,if Nicole's porch became a bloodbath,the killer (or killers)would be sullied in blood.And the state claims to have found a spot of blood,in OJ's Bronco.Well,that blood-speck was not even conclusively linked to OJ's blood-DNA.(It's similar to the Lizzie Bordon case,in which Lizzie claimed she had crushed a beetle-bug on her dress,when interogated about a blood speck on her dress.Years later,Lizzie's claim was validated through more advanced testing and determined to was of a non-mammal origin.)Lastly, many claim OJ's fleeing in the Bronco,is proof of guilt.Well,if you had at least a dozen white cops ,on your tail,in the aftermath of the Rodney King beating,would you stop for a chat??I still say Nicole was mixed-up with some shady-characters,who saw her place as real cozy to hang-out at ,while their talent agents get back to them .Or the next drug-buy location was being set-up. So my pretties,keep your daughters off the yellow-brick road! HeHeHe!(Update-Nov.21-O.J was contacted by the Fox network and their publisher.O.J already made his statements about what he believed happened.The Fox News muckrackers were trying to cash-in on an old cold case.I saw a documentary ,last week ,on the E network, about famous Hollywood crimes. The crime-story was altered from the original report.On the E network,they stated that Nicole's mother forgot her prescription eye-glasses at the Mezzaluna ristorante.But the original story,was that Nicole forgot her sun-glasses.So if,the revised story is true,why didn't Nicole's mother have a second pair?Was that her only pair of seeing-glasses?And the revised story,still did not explain how Ron Goldman knew how to get there,so readily.Did he use Map-quest?And were the bodies semi-nude or clothed? The idea that the killer was waiting around outside,and waited for a happen-stance guest-visitor to unexpectly ring the door-bell,and kill both seems unlikely.Why would Simpson risk everything,waiting alongside Nicole's house,for an hour,and expect not to be noticed by barking dogs or inquiring neighbors? If OJ hired a hit-man,the sky would be the limit,for book,media and movie deals,for the hired killer.Even if the hitman,became imprisoned.The case still has many troubling questions and no winners of justice 
 I am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids.  4% Iron and no other vitamins??  With childhood obesity at epidemic proportions, why would ANYONE feed their children all of these empty calories?? It is like giving them Coke or Pepsi for BREAKFAST!! OK ORGANIC Coke but still Coke!! I am sad because I have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species!! But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN 
 National Geographic Magazine is famous for their excellent photography; it is the very reason I picked up this volume. However, Wide Angle: National Geographic Greatest Places failed to live up to my expectations. I was underwhelmed not only by a large portion of the images, but mostly by the poorly executed concept. In a title that clearly implies these are the greatest places featured, I felt the chosen photographs illustrated some lackluster locales. Furthermore, the organization was too loose. The book could have benefited from better formating not only of its categories, but of the photos themselves, which are often stretched in an unflattering matter.  
 I was surprised at the extent of the author's blasphemy. He seems to think he can read the mind of God. He seems to claim that he knows what God wants, how God communicates and so on. If I didn't know better, it seems like he's claiming to be a prophet. I can think of better religious books.  I'll give him two stars because I assume (hope) he's good intentioned 
 Jenna Marshall is a high school chemistry teacher.  Steven Hatcher is a cop whose son is suddenly failing Jenna's class.  They are instantly attracted as he literally runs into her in the hall and is intrigued because she wears garters (to school???).  She's flunked the star football player, Rudy Lutz, and now someone is vandalizing her car, classroom, etc.  He's on the hunt for a serial killer who kidnaps cheerleaders, shaves their heads and mutilates them while at the same time trying to raise 3 boys.    Funny how their problems seem to have a way of coinciding.  After loving Rose's first book, I'm Watching You, I was very disappointed in Have You Seen Her?.  The plot has holes you can drive a Mac truck through.  Such as, given the killer's modus operandi, why would he instead break into Jenna's apartment and try to stab her?  And why, after Steven's declared that Jenna needs round the clock protection, does he just leave her sitting alone for hours at the school where her tormentors knowingly lurk because he can't get around to picking her up or sending someone else to get her?  And how can they daily vandalize her classroom in a locked school?  And ... unfortunately, there's way too many to list them all.  I'm Watching You may have had similar plot flaws but if so I didn't notice because I loved the interaction between the characters.  Not so here.  Jenna was fine, but Steven was a whiny whimp, with the romance constantly interrupted by something stupid that he does.  I haven't given up yet on Rose; I'll try her next one with the hope that it's much more like her first book and much much better than this one 
 Judge Pressler's views in "A Hill On Which to Die..." though may be sincere, lacks the breadth of theological understanding of the various expressions of Christianity. Pressler, like many Fundamentalists, fail to accept that much of our understanding of scripture and theological concepts are interpretations and very few of the arguments that he is willing to die for would effect salvific truth. Every sincere believer and every denomination thinks in one way or another they have the "correct" view and interpretation. The problem is not believing. Pressler is correct in his argument that one must stand firm in one's belief. However, his failure in the book is the adequate display of the fact that Christianity, even among  faithful Southern Baptists, is broader than the narrow views which he holds. His concepts of Christianity would undoubtedly reject the Christianity of C. S. Lewis (Anglican), J. I. Packer (Anglican), Eugene Peterson (Presbyterian), Mother Theresa (Roman Catholic), and the vast majority of both main line and evangelical Christianity. For these reasons and others, I would not recommend this book 
 Georgescu-Roegen's intentions are laudable, as are many of his proposals. The thermodynamic basis of this work, unfortunately, is unsupportable. This is a pity, as it has left his critique of capitalism open to dismissal, and has contributed to a generation of obfuscation in social and environmental theory.  The problem, simply put, is this: while it sounds convincing to most lay-people (and even many physicists, chemists and engineers) to equate thermodynamic entropy with "disorder", this is based on a meaningless misinterpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics simply states that energy tends to disperse, if it is not hindered from doing so. It says nothing about "orderliness", and nothing about availability of matter.  Entropy is an extensive property of thermodynamic systems. It is not a property of energy, and certainly not of matter. It is nonsensical to speak of "high- or low-entropy" energy. It is even more nonsensical to speak of "high- or low-entropy" matter. Better to speak of energy quality ("the sun provides us with high-quality energy, and low-quality energy is re-radiated back into space"). Entropy is used to measure the "concentration" (I use this term for illustration only) and hence the usefulness or availability to us of energy, within a given system of matter and energy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us nothing about the tendency of matter to become more or less useful or available to us. There is no thermodynamic basis for reading inevitable decay onto physical, biological or social systems.  Dr. Frank L. Lambert, Professor Emeritus (Chemistry) of Occidental College, Los Angeles, has carried out extensive work over the past few years to demythologise the popular (and, all too frequently, specialist) misunderstanding of the second law of thermodynamics. For anyone contemplating reading "The entropy law and the economic process", I would strongly advise that you first look at Lambert's website: http://www.entropysite.com. He goes through this in detail in multiple format aimed at a range of audiences from lay-person to scientist and engineer.  This review is not intended to be disparaging, towards either Georgescu-Roegen, or others who share the common misunderstanding of the second law of thermodynamics. The problem is deeply entrenched and it will be a long time before the myths around entropy and the second law are dispelled. This is a start 
 When Alejandro Jodorowsky's debut Fando y Lis was originally released back in 1967, a full-scale riot broke out in the audience, the director barely escaped the theater with his life, and the film was banned. That has got be the best, most intriguing publicity I have ever heard of any picture receiving. Of course, when I heard about this, I simply had to see it. I mean, what could this film possibly contain that could provoke such an extreme reaction?  After watching it, I honestly have to say that I really don't know.  Fando y Lis is by far the strangest, most bizarre film I have ever seen. There is no cohesive narrative, no coherent style, and in the end, no real point. The movie feels like some incredibly strange spawn of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Eraserhead, and 8 1/2, though it is very different (and far more bizarre) than any of those films. This is an art house flick, through and through. Fiercely experimental and filmed on a shoestring budget, its unbelievably loose (almost non-existent) plot follows Fando and his half-paralyzed girlfriend Lis as they search a wasteland inhabited by hoards of...erm...interesting characters for the mythical city of Tar, a paradise on Earth. Or are they even on Earth? In this film, nothing is for certain.  When one watches an obtuse art film such as Fando y Lis, one's first reaction is most likely to try and decipher it and unlock its "message" or "meaning", so to speak. However, there is no such thing in Fando. Jodorowsky himself said that he finds what he doesn't understand to interest him the most, so in reality, no one is going to understand this film, because I'm not really even sure there is anything to understand.  That said, there are still some rather intriguing visuals and scenes in Fando, such as an incredibly striking sequence involving black paint (at least I think it's black paint - the black and white cinematography makes it hard to tell). Actually, this brings me to the point of the cinematography, which, in my opinion, is the most unsettling aspect of the film. Though it was filmed in the 1960s, the black and white is bleached and brightened to an uncomfortable degree, giving one the impression that the film was shot in 1920s. For some reason, it gives the whole picture something of a disturbing aura.  Unfortunately, the fact that this is Jodorowsky's first film really shows. The whole thing seems more like a big experiment than anything else, and some rather amateur editing and borderline laughable sequences ruin a lot of the interesting segments. That's not to say the film is without worth; it makes for a rather interesting watch. But overall, it just feels like a heavily experimental student film with no real purpose. It can be hard to sit through occasionally, but at 93 minutes, it doesn't drag for too long, and it is worth viewing if only for its historical value 
 Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see. 
 If you want something that might motivate you to make a film..-_-  then go ahead and buy it... but dont expect to learn anything useful 
 In his interminably boring, mice type liner notes, Brad Mehldau goes to great lengths dispelling the notion that he might sound like Bill Evans. The message being, `Oh golly, there's so much more going on in my playing-Please.' Well, I can assure you, Bill Evans he's not. He wouldn't qualify to give Bill Evans a cab ride uptown. Matter of fact, he sounds more like watered down Keith Jarrett-nothing very original going on here. And if you need 10,000 words of liner notes to explain what you're doing-guess what-you ain't doing squat. As a pianist who's been playing modern jazz for 40 years, I can tell you to sit this set out. And if you want Bill Evans or Keith Jarrett, go get the real thing. 
 If you're a conservative, as am I, you'll have no problem with Mr. Snow's politics.  He raises legitimate concerns about the spread of socialist thinking in America, describing it as a "mind virus."  Given the pathogenicity of the leftist agenda, the term is apt.  However, Mr. Snow falls victim to pop psychology, specifically the heresy that positive thinking alone effects change in our lives, as opposed to reflection, hard work, and persistence.  His introductory discussion of the unseen "vibrations" all around us is as confusing as it is disturbing.  Come to think of it, THAT may be a mind virus.  Finally, nearly half the book is devoted to a reprinting of the United Nations Charter and the Humanist Manifestos I and II, which are easily obtained online; no need to pay $16.95 for them.  If Mr. Snow stuck to politics and writing original material, his readers would benefit greatly 
 My son's best friend got one of those for christmas and we went to the lake to test it against my son's regular RC boat. The hovercraft was very slow and not quite that maneuverable. It hovered OK on water, but couldn't handle sand or concrete. The "skirt" slipped out of its track a couple times (despite our being careful fitting it as best as we could), filling with water - the foam inside it didn't prevent the boat from being swamped by the smallest wave (even in good shape it couldn't handle waves like the other boat.) The thin skirt finally ripped and the boat is pretty much unusable now. Big disapointment. It was somewhat fun while it worked, the concept was intriguing for the gearhead boys, but once the novelty wore off the regular boat was a lot more exciting and all the kids prefered taking turns running that one. 
 That about says it all.  This cereal is just too sweet.  Their Flax cereal is better 
 I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows.  I'm not, so I couldn't tell you.  Mediocre at best.  "This is Spinal Tap" was better 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep 
 I am a big fan of the tv show so I was expecting more from this book than it delivered.  There are some helpful hints, but I would have really liked a lot more examples from the show and inspirational room pictures. 
 Don't waste your money..this book is really bad...the photographs look like they came from a GYN book...no class here.. if you want to see what this book shows..then go get a book on GYN 
 Long time fan, but didn't get much out of this one.  Stories were cute.  Didn't finish it, not worth more time 
 If this is supposed to be a satire, then the author forgot the key element...wit. This waste of wood pulp lacks intelligence and humor, and only the most ditzy of flakes would be able to stomach reading more than halfway through. Here's a little advice for the author; take thirty-five cents out of your coin purse, drop it into the nearest pay phone, dial the number of whoever told you that you'd make a decent author, and inform them that they have made baby Jesus weep 
 I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more. 
 I was given this book for free by the owner of a bookstore when I told him that that I was starting a bookstore.     I learned maybe, oh, 5 or 6 things that were slightly important.  I especially learned how radically the bookmarket has changed in such a short period of time, and how mired in the past this book is (even with it's new chapter on the Internet).   In any business, there will always be a middle man- but the face of the middleman in the book business is so changed that it is tough to write a book that stays current.   For the young bucks starting in the industry, do subject and content searches of discussion boards hosted by the big bookselling pages: amazon.com (most useful), and abe.com.  Getting a part time job doing grunt work (shelving, cleaning) at a local used bookstore will provide you with more practical education in a day than this book will.  
 This book provides more confusion and frustration to a student than anything.  It ceases to offer sufficient example problems, while the few problems that do exist pertain to the less important theory.  Also, the  text provides a lack of explaination as to where it gets its values for  constants - nearly all chapter problems require the utilization of some  type of constant, yet the book has no tables of these values.  I actually  had to refer to my thermodynamics text in order to finish the questions  from this book.  It almost seems as if the book was rushed, since it  doesn't explain or justify anything. Finally, I would like to mention that  this was the most expensive of all my texts.  I regret purchasing this  text, as I could have learned more about fluid mechanics in my bathtub than  from this book 
 I've had my Micro for over a year now, and when it worked, I loved it! However, I'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue; the sound is output in layers, and I am constantly trying to "reposition" my headphones to get full sound. My husband called Creative Labs for assistance, and he was told that it would cost him [...] per month for a "customer service subscription." After reading these reviews, it seems we'd be paying Creative Labs [...] so that they could tell us there's nothing they can (or will) do. Next brand, please...  
 This book was quite boring. Within the first few pages (when Ruby describes her own birth) hints were dropped about the ultimate "big secret" of the book. By the time I'd read a quarter of the book, there were so many hints it wasn't a secret any more. By the time I got to the end, I was disappointed that there wasn't anything more to the story than that. None of the characters were particularly likeable, nor were they bad enough to hate.  The book was billed as "darkly funny and satirical" in one review. I saw no humor except for the brief slapstick physical mishaps at a wedding reception late in the book. On reflection, I gained nothing from reading this book, and got about a half-minute of laughter from that one scene. It truly was a waste of my limited reading time 
 I had to buy this book for my college course and  I found it wasn't relevant to my prefered job industry. This book is not interesting. And I recommend to the authors, that they rewrite this  in terms that make it  more iteresting to students 
 I had a serious problem with this book.  Firstly, the characters are one dimensional and terrible.  And secondly, the main flaw to the novel is the amount of information that that Mr. Stross feels is pertinent for the reader.   For me, an avid science fiction reader, instead of reading every word about an interesting piece of equipment or a weird mutation on Rochald's World I consciously skipped over the lengthy sentences.  The story does have some strength in its ideas.  The idea of the festival is extremely interesting and a little more focus would have greatly improved the novel.  1/5 execution, 1/5 focus, 5/5 ideas, 2/5 overall with execution by far the most important 
 This movie was really bad.  The victim deserved what she got, her husband was way more concerned with clearing his name than with his wife's death and the identity of the killer was obvious from the start.  Three blatant Dr. Pepper product placements had me expecting the actors to break into song at any minute.  "I'm a Pepper, he's a Pepper,  .... Wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too?" A full frontal nude shot of the victim diving into a pool as seen in a daydream sequence was totally unnecessary to the plot and obviously was included only for titillation. What a stinko movie 
 If you like shallow arguements and can't think yourself out of a paper bag, this is a must read.  Bill use hate speach that will awe the stupid and make the intelligent cry out in frustration.  Remember unlike the government, Bill knows what is best for us....mainly buying his cheap products and buying these third grade readers 
 I listened to this thing after checking CD set out from the local library - luckily I did not plunk down my own money for it (and only wasted one hour)!   The first CD is an extended sales-pitch for other E-myth "books", website, worksheets, and consulting services (as obviously are some of the reviews posted here that "plug" the author's coaching practice). Even as a sales pitch, the book fails, being very crude and heavy-handed in the used-car-salesman, creepy kind of way. I gave up after listening to one CD, during which I heard about the website, the "coaching" service, the newsletter, and numerous god's blessings for the author, and then about the website, the coaching service, the newsletter, god's mysterious ways and blessings for the author, and so on, ad nauseam.   All this, interspersed with a few sentimental, dull, and annoyingly protracted personal anecdotes with little or no relevance to business issues. What I have not heard during this first part, however, was a SINGLE useful piece of advice or constructive insight regarding running a small business, or good business practices in general. As another reviewer before me, I too felt particularly put-off by the tone, and additionally by the frequent mentions of god, blessings, "miracles", and "mysterious ways" all abused as part of the sales pitch.   I am sorry to have wasted my time on this. If you think you have to read it, check it out from the local library where, I am quite sure, it's gathering dust on the bookshelves. If you need sound business advice, I'll agree with another reviewer who recommended the book Winning by Jack Welch instead 
 While I absolutely adore Sylvia Browne and also Chris by default, this book was an utter disappointment. There is absolutely nothing new in "My Psychic Journey". Even some of the anecdotes overlap with Sylvia's other books. Chris has simply rewritten his mother's books and didn't even both to change the style or tone to fit his own personality. I got nothing from reading it and was sorely disappointed. The only difference between "Psychic Journey" and Sylvia's books is that Chris writes erratically, dragging in some places while not expanding in others. Every single chapter eventually deviates from the original topic and then comes back toward the end, seemingly to make a point (which doesn't happen) which only serves to highlight the fact that the reader has just read several pages about essentially nothing of relevance.   However, if you're entirely new to the topics in both Chris and Syvlia's books, then this may have some value to you. But even as such, I strongly recommend Sylvia's books rather than this one. This is hard to read and has many grammatical errors, which Chris writes off altogether as "his train of thought in which he writes" in a foreword at the beginning of the book.  Overall, I'm extremely disappointed. It's not that I dislike Chris, it's that this book serves no purpose at all. It didn't need to be written and it shouldn't have been written. 
 This book did not work for me. I believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship. In this book, the author, rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves, presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex. Personally, I'm not looking to 'trick' anyone into going out with me or fall in love. How I open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as I'm walking around after I've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game' properly. I don't feel that it's a game. It's about being true to ourselves. It's about relating - being best friends. And we are not peacocks - displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time. We are empowered with language. I'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as Gray does. Authors that I recommend are Charlotte Kasl, John Welwood and John Stoltenberg. Good luck! 
 You'll never get the straight story about nationalism out of Eric Hobsbawm, who himself appears to try to reconcile his own ethnic identity with the topic.  David Pryce-Jones once noted that in Hobsbawm's own autobiography: "he [Hobsbawm] boasts of a visit to Bir Zeit University on the West Bank to display solidarity with the Palestinians.  Why Palestinian nationalism is valid, and Jewish nationalism invalid, is something else Hobsbawm fails to analyze and explain. Quite crudely, he approves of nationalism in countries which proclaim themselves Communist and anti-American, like Cuba or Vietnam, while rejecting nationalism in countries which are not Communist and are pro-American, like Israel" ([...], Jan. 3, 2003).  Such twisted thinking is evident through "Nations and Nationalism," where Mr. Hobsbawm spares no effort, however subtle, to demean nationalism that doesn't conform to his pre-existing prejudices.  In short, when writing about nationalism, Mr. Hobsbawm allowed his considerable analytic and writing skills to become corrupted by his religion, communism.  Therefore, unless you are an acolyte of that religion, this book is not worth your time, money or effort to read, and if you *are* a member of that religion, I suggest you broaden your intellectual horizons a bit, perhaps by reading Liah Greenfield's "Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity" or Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities. 
 I found the book to be a waste of time, energy, ink, and trees. It is nothing more then common sense re-emphasized. It gives a little bit of understanding the basic personality types, but does not give one the ability to "speed read". It basically says stuff like 'if a person is shy and doesnt socialize well, they are an introvert', well duhhh. DO NOT waste your money on piece-o-crap book. It is useless 
 Not a single insight. Not a single "aha". Go read something else 
 I own ever Buffy the Vampire Slayer book published and most of the books are really good, but this one is really bad.  The plot is sub-par at best, and the writting makes one not even want to finish the book, I an avid Buffy fan could't even sit through this one.  If you have to give up a book give this one up, only buy to complete a collection like me 
 How can a collection featuring Yma Sumac, Townes Van Zandt, Nina Simone and Moondog get only 2 stars, because of Kenny Rogers & the 1st Edition. This version of the song sucks, and the scene in the movie sucked. Edit this self indulgant dreck out of both and they rate higher 
 The story I found ho-hum, nothing really that amazing.  I thought the official 9/11 report much more interesting.    I was particularly distracted by Posner's overuse of footnotes -- not to be confused with endnotes, where an author documents his sources and are good, Posner likes to have footnotes sprinkled about on most pages.  This style is annoying b/c apparently (or as near as I can figure), there is no threshold in Posner's mind as to what qualifies as a footnote versus a regular paragraph.  A skilled author could easily have incorporated the relevant content of the footnotes into the main text.  Overall, ho hum.  Wish I didn't pay so much for the hard-cover version 
 The central problem in this novel is that a main character can only be too desperate before one begins to despise them.  
 The book was so general that I found it quite unhelpful, at least for what I thought it would be useful for: helping me find a strategy for curbing excessive dog barking.  
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 I suppose I should have realised that if I hated "L'Avventura", I would probably hate this, too. Just wish I'd thought of that before buying it. Ponderous, slow, self-consciously arty. A milestone in cinematic history, and all that, but terribly off putting and, in some instances, terribly obvious in its ennui. There will be much eye-rolling on your part. You probably only need to see this if its part of a film studies course. Really.   Good package by Criterion, though. 
 I remember reading this book when I was a teen, at a time when the church I was attending was very much into end-time prophecies. Embarrassing as it is to admit it, I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. (*blush*) Yet, 1988 came and went, nothing horrible happened, and I forgot about this steaming pile of dog manure. It didn't matter, though, because there were, and still are, plenty of other "prophetic" books to fill the gap and keep Christians pants-wetting scared. I am no longer a Christian, and in retrospect, I wonder why we were all so scared by Hal Lindsey's nonsense. After all, the end times meant that Sweet Jesus was coming and we'd all be raptured away into the clouds to avoid all the tribulation and terror! I think there was the secret fear that we wouldn't be good enough and our allegedly loving savior would leave us behind on a whim.   At any rate, I wouldn't recommend Hal's book for any purpose other than fireplace kindling, or maybe as a good laugh at the gullibility of desperate and easily frightened people. He is no different than any other self-proclaimed prophet of God, picking whatever scriptures he can to back up his crazy ideas and attempting to use math to count the number of days, weeks, and generations since this or that event. If you must buy it, look for it at thrift stores, where you can pick it up for 50 cents; save your ten bucks for something more worthwhile, like a couple of Spider-Man comics or something 
 This product is difficult to use and does not clearly cover the scratches on the lenses as advertised.  There are bubbles in the product that do not clear up as it dries.  I do not recommend this!  Just get new glasses 
 This is but a short "add-on" to Timothy Kearney's excellent review of this book.  I found The Writer's Guide to Character Traits merely another textbook formula for creating wooden people.  Stereotypical.  Gives you nothing that would enable you to maximize these traits--qualify them for  inclusive fitness into your story.  At best, this book is good for (occasional) checklist purposes only.  Far and away, in my opinion, the most USEFUL book on characterization is Karen Hood's Creating Character Emotions.  #####  Before buying this book I would recommend reading Timothy Kearney's review. Re-read it. Then read it again.       
 This movie isnt very good or funny and it is so predictable I am not a big fan of comedy movies but I always watch them. This movie was just too chezzy.Marlon Wayans just isnt funny he's too silly.dont buy this movie 
 This movie is one of those sublimely awful movies that should be savored line by line, wretched moment by wretched moment.    As truly awful as "Plan 9 From Outer Space."  So awful it's terrifying at first, then mesmerizing, then strangely exhilirating--I mean, can people really conceive of something THIS bad?  The "Best Worst" Film of the entire 80s, by a long shot 
 This was a book that i was required to read for my english lit class.  Although i didn't personally like the book, many people that i know did.  I found the subject matter very boring, partly because of my inability to relate to it.  I would only recommend this book to someone with a strong interest in South African politics 
 I'm a huge Audrey fan but this one kind of leaves me cold. There are much better selections out there, shop aroun 
 I wanted to give this book a good review, but I cannot recommend it for a beginner. Like many readers, I came to it because I wanted to learn about philosophy and it was the only book on subject that I had heard of. The good news is that after 800 pages, I still wanted to learn more. The bad news is that I still knew very little.   The first problem is that the book has way too much breadth for a beginner. You do not need to spend 100 pages on Greek philosophy before even coming to Plato. For those that are interested in purchasing the book, I would suggest trimming the list to: Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, Kant, Locke, Leibniz, Hegel, and then everything from Schopenhauer onwards.  The second problem is that the book is dated. Russell wrote it during World War II and there have been huge developments in philosophy since then. Some examples include the decline of the logicst program and logical positivism, the development of ordinary language philosophy, the later Wittgenstein, and a lot more on pragmatism beyond William James (such as Quine), and a rebirth of Christian philosophy from within the analytic and empirical traditions that Russell advanced (such as the works of Alvin Plantinga and William Lane Craig). It is standard for contemporary introductions to philosophy to cover most of these later developments.  A third problem has been well commented on by many other reviewers, which is Russell's bias and his dismissive treatment of philosophers that he does not agree with.   Finally, although histories have their place, they are not a good way to actually learn philosophy. Instead they are best used for becoming familiar with the major names and what they did. To actually learn philosophy you need an introductory book that directly focuses on the ideas.   My advice to someone new to philosophy is to buy 'An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis' by John Hospers. It is a gentle but rigorous textbook that is ideal for the first timer. It has a bias towards atheism, but theists should not pass up such a well-written book. Then follow it up with the even more rigorous and thorough 'Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview' by JP Moreland, even if you aren't a Christian. It has the best explanations of epistemology and metaphysics that I've seen. At that point you may want to get some logic under your belt, so if you are still ambitious, buy 'An Introduction to Logic' by Harry Gensler. The logicola software that accompanies the book is ideal for learning philosophical logic through self-study. 
 I didn't buy this pilot episode, but wasn't this the first episode in Season 1?  I've been reading the reviews of certain items and wanted to let everyone know that you can buy the seasons on DVD at http://www.quantumdvds.150m.com/bhillsdesc.htm I can tell you it's not cheap, but you get all 10 seasons.  It's worth checking out.  If you're a true fan and if you're watching the season in re-runs on FX 
 Breathnach's Simple Abundance and gratitude journal changed my life. I am in a temporary apartment awaiting closing on a home in a new state when I cam across Moving On. I couldn't wait to delve in. It seems quite stream of consciousness and more self help for Sarah - if readers find it useful that may be a bonus rather than the objective. You will find pearls of wisdom. But you have to dig through Sarah's written clutter to find them, all while she hopes to motivate us to rid ourselves of home clutter.I am on pg 157 of 269 and what is helpful could be distilled down to a magazine article. However, if you wish to commiserate with disappointment and unhappiness, you will find Sarah good company, despite her success and recent marriage. 
 Delores Cannon certainly gives us an interesting view into the lives of the Essenes.  Built on the assumption of reincarnation and the possibility of past life regression, she attempts to show much detail of the times and peoples that were the Essene community, and ultimately, the life of Christ.  While it certainly is interesting reading, it is completely devoid of corroborating evidence.  She tends to agree or disagree with Archaeologists (never saying who her sources are), depending on whether they agree with her research.  Also, she supports the validity of her story as being more authentic than the Biblical account, as she claims to have an older source, a teacher named Suddi from the Essene community.  Some problems include the fact that while she claims the Biblical record has been changed, she seems to forget that the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran actually show the accuracy of the Biblical record, by moving the Old Testament back 1100 years, and yet with no significant changes.  It seems that her purpose is to promote her own view of reality, than to deal with any real historical evidence.  While it's an interesting story, I have to deeply question that there's anything resembling true research or evidence in this book 
 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 This book was suggested to me by a dear friend. Though, the concept of servant leadership is strong, I am sure I don't want to read this book again to understand it.. 
 I had owned a pair of Sketchers a few years back and was happy with the brand then.  When I got these shoes I was surprised to see that they were not to the quality standards that I remembered.  I like lace-less shoes, but these were not adjustable, so for my narrow foot they didn't fit and they were still hard to get on.  I decided to send them back within 10 min 
 I tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable. You didnt even have one walker availiable, How is it possible that such a big outlet like yours not to have one walker? I was very disapionted. I guess that I would have to rate you with a zero. And I would like to know when will there be any walkers available? I like to shop with Amazon 
 A reader writes: "However, Mr. Sulloway's book is tightly reasoned and supported by a great deal of research."  You might want to look at the discussion of Sulloway's work in Judith Harris' recent _No Two Alike_, pp 92-112. According to that account, Sulloway's work was never published in a peer reviewed journal, the book in which it was published failed to provide the sort of information needed for other people to check the truth of his results, and Sulloway repeatedly refused requests for such data--for instance, the names of the Protestant and Catholic martyrs whose birth order rankings he offers as evidence, or cites to the studies whose results he claims to summarize.   When someone wrote a critical article pointing out evidence that his factual assertions about the data were false, he delayed the publication for several years by the threat of lawsuits.  Judging by her previous book, Harris is a careful writer, so absent some evidence to the contrary my current conclusion is that Sulloway is a fraud 
 The DVD does not work in Ireland so it is absolutely useless!! I should have been made aware of this when I was purchasing the product. I would like to be refunded in full for  the three DVDs I have purchased: My Fair Lady, Paris when it Sizzles and Breakfast at Tiffanys (purchased at the same time) Also the packaging costs were not displayed until i had entered my credit card number and were much too expensive. Overall i am extremely disappointed with my experience and I expect to be compensated for this 
 I have to say, this CD is pretty bad. The songs on it are just pointless chants and words that should never have been said. I am not a fan of censorship, so i do not think that this should be censored, but it is everyones own choice to buy this or not, and trust me, this rap group only lives off the controversy, not talent, so don't buy it 
 I don't even use it anymore, didn't think it was that great.  I got a gel rest from fellows, a lot better... 
 "Deception" is the edited version of "Ruby Cairo," which is not a great movie but which is better than this one.  It isn't just the sex scene that was edited out, but a total of about 20 minutes.  The movie makes more sense in the RC version, and the sex scene, though dark and in Andie's case a bit airbrushed, is worth seeing, especially if you are a Viggo Mortensen fan.  I don't think it was the nudity Andie objected to, though, or not entirely.  The scene ends in an act of contempt that would sting any woman.  It effectively lets you know what the man's character is really thinking, but it's brutal in a subtle way.  There is also, of course, the (apparent) age difference between the two characters. He looks about 10 years younger than she does, even with a beard 
 All I can say is that if and when this novel is made into a movie, expect a lot of changes. A screenwriter will certainly not go with such a slow, dragging pace. Also, there will need to be many more actual confrontations with Dracula, not just infinitesimal accretions of knowledge boringly gained through research about the vampire. There will need to be more horryfing scenes and far less looking through dry manuscripts. And that pretty much sums up my objections to the book 
 Jodie Foster Is one of the Greatest Actress's Ever period,but this clunky film is so boring&Predictable that it just never gets off the ground&put me to sleep. a film full of Cliches&dime a dozen story lines that never goes anywhere 
 In his book Professor Gaddis tried to convince a reader that current US course of preemption, unilateralism, and hegemony is legitimate and even feasible and realistic. He found legitimacy in the past US experiences - during John Quincy Adams administration. I agree with author up to a point. But it was never a doctrine but a set of practical tools, and hegemony was applied to the American land and sea, not Okinawa or Tashkent. I also agree that security is a raison d'etre of the governments everywhere. But Gaddis hyperbolically pictures preemption, unilateralism, and hegemony as a coherent doctrine, which ought to dominate US foreign policy, while John Quincy Adams applied as it as a set of tools to be used for the practical necessity of protecting American lands from intruders. In reality, it is not a coherent doctrine, but a hotchpotch of ideas developed in various times by various nations. Thus preemption was first developed and applied by Bismarck and Moltke. The Germans successfully used against the French in 1871. But since then in proved to be a double-edge sword and, in wrong hands, brought a disaster back to the Germans, for example, Hitler's invasion in Russia in 1941.  Hegemony is a Greek concept, where hegemon means a Chieftain. How realistically US can be a chieftain in this post-modern world, where every state insists to be a sovereign of its own land, remains an open question.  Unilateralism is a less controversial concept, but the US was always a unilateralist by nature, except a brief period of World War II, but this was rather an aberration. American exceptionalism is a strong undercurrent and unilateralism is just a manifestation of this idea.  Although Gaddis is subtler than most neocons, his book inadvertently helps to justify neo-conservatives' rejection of diplomacy in dealing with other states under the banner of unilateralism.   But I have other criticism - It is interesting to me that Gaddis mentioned Adam Smith at the end of the book. In 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed - in effect burying the idea of possibility of Western-style modernization in Russia. Thus Marxian doctrine of rapid progress and modernization based on coercive and hegemonic power of proletariat appears to be dismissed. However Marx's ideas were based on the ideas of European Enlightenment thinkers, most notably Adam Smith. Smith was the most influential economist of his time and he was in effect a creator of idea of leissez faire or unfettered capitalism. Smith's ideas were based on one central premise of Homo Economicus. Re-emergence after the end of the Cold war of religion, ethnicity and rivalry to territory and recourses makes a mockery of the idea of rational, economical man - the bedrock of the Western civilization, or better said the Enlightenment civilization, which strongest and last outpost is the US. Gaddis dismisses that as he dismisses Mujaheddin as 'pirates, marauders, and agents of predatory empires' (page 110). But fundamentalism is a post-modern phenomenon, not a 'blast from the past'. It is a thought-provoking book, but unfortunately, Gaddis resembles to me a scholar who lives in proverbial Ivory Tower not noticing tectonic shifts everywhere around him 
 This film starts with an event based on a true crime. A talk radio show host in Denver was killed by an American Nazi. (This event inspired the "Talk Radio" play and film.) This film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region. No mention of their economic status; are they losing dollars and population, small businesses, etc. Instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him! This seems too exaggerated to believe. Federal agents are aware of this but don't want to act yet. Their agent is sent back to get more information. There are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas. The film doesn't explain what created them. It shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions. No real names, of course.  The Federal agent meets to report to her higher ups. Then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities (based on real events). Most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group. (The FBI put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s.) This Federal agency doesn't interfere because they want more information on their aims (and their leaders). More terrorism is planned: dynamiting a courthouse, attacking a power station, etc. The terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day! Kathy finds a secret list of "friends". This is quickly copied with a camera. The Federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them. Gary meets with the leader (who arrives in a helicopter!) And shows documents that say Kathy is a special investigator. Is Kathy being served up as a sacrifice? Gary and Kathy travel to Chicago, where an assassination is planned that will make Gary the fall guy. (Another Lee Harvey Oswald?) A second "lone gunman" shoots the politician in front of a building. Gary fails to shoot, and won't ever try this again.  Costa-Gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film "Z". A few years later his film about rebels in South America was popular. His later films have seemed mediocre. A better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does; better pacing could help. The threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film (e.g., Timothy McVeigh). Those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts.  A better film today would show the bad results from "NAFTA" and "Free Trade" in harming most Americans economically. But Hollywood would never allow a film about this "war on the middle class". The word `nafta' in Greek and Arabic refers to `petroleum'. NAFTA is a symbol for the policies designed for Big Oil. It is like George W. Bush calling his policy "Operation Iraqi Liberation". 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 Another left-wing, hippie idiot who dropped out of any sort of real career in 1975 has to sustain himself by writing this anti-technology dystopic rubbish.  I'm sure that he has plenty of ideological fellow travelers in Hollywood with whom he should team up to make another version of "12 Monkeys" or "The Fight Club."  This is just left-wing, nihilist, anti-human rubbish motivated by a hatred of humanity and mans' productive capacity.    Like, the world ended when we ran out of trees to burn as fuel?  I'm sure that trees were cheaper than coal for 15th or 16th century Britain, but they made the transition from one energy source to another without resorting to cannabilism or having their civilization self-destruct like this author would have us believe.  The collapse of civilizations is not tied to the end of cheap energy, but is more likely due to a descent into decadence and sloth.  If there is not enough oil, we can switch to coal, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and nuclear (fission or fusion-in the future).    All these self-styled futurists are just full of rubbish and make predictions which they then sell to an ignorant public just so they can pay their rent.  Most science fiction is garbage and this just proves my point.  How many science fiction authors in the early 1980's or before predicted the emergence of the internet?  Almost none by my estimate.  Don't waste your money helping this guy pay his rent.  He's a nihilist and misanthrope.    As long as men are free to think, communicate and trade, long-term optimism is the order of the day as the secular trend for civilization is always upwards and onwards 
 Uhhh, puh-lease. Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away. I had to read this book for school. It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog. They lose the dog. They are sad. They can't figure out who took the dog. The dog comes back. Whoop-dee-doo. End. Ya see? I could have written this book better. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!! EVER!! 
 The book was an interesting enough read to keep in my library, but I would not consider it a legitimate argument for the Aquatic Ape Theory - nor, specifically, for the aquatically influenced evolution of the human female and the proceeding ramifications. It approaches the issue in a simplistic, unscientific manner that is not at all convincing. Keeping in mind that this book is dated (having been first published in 1972) could not save it's argument either. The Descent of Woman left just me as I was before and I'll be looking further still for writings on the subject 
 I bought the base and two handsets 2 yrs ago, and one of the handset completely stopped working after 1.5 yrs. After a year, we replaced the rechargable battery in every handsets, but one of the handsets started loosing it's power very quickly (we charge for 6 hrs and it lasted for 10 minutes), and then stopped working. There's an ongoing class action lawsuit against the series KXTG and KXTC in NJ, and the law firm encourages every consumer, regardless of state, who had any problems with these models to fill out a questionaire at their website (they only ask for your name, email address, state, and comment). http://www.sheller.com/Practice.asp?PracticeID=140 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 Through the book I felt that the author was not able to grab me with the emotional intensity that he was going for.  I never could quite buy into the whole "The Big Pharma's Are All Bad."  I did really like the end of the book.  I felt a real connection and love between him and his wife, even though she had passed away.  The author also let's us know what is going to happen:  he will be killed also.  Then he lets the protagonist Jason discover it for himself.  When he is closest to his wife, at the place she was killed, and closest to her cause.  Le Carre points an accusing finger at the US in his book and end notes, but provides little detail to support his accusations.  In fact, BIg Pharma is multinational.  Some of the largest like Bayer are German.  These are the companies that helped gas the Jews.  Looking for an atrocity?  Why not let us write about documented proven suffering without writing books about fictional conspiracy theories, which by his own admission at the end of the book do not exist.  I feel he has an axe to grind with these people.  My Opinion:  Big Pharma gets a bad rap.  I think I owe my life to a monoclonal antibody called rituxan:    Rituxan® (Rituximab) is a unique therapy that works by selectively depleting CD20+ B-cells. B-cells, and their role in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Rheumatoid Arthritis, have been an area of intensive research by scientists around the world, and at Genentech and Biogen Idec. Rituxan affects your immune system by selectively targeting CD20+ B-cells shown to play an important role in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis.  Side effects?  Oh it had side effects all right.  It cured my knee problems (which I assume to be arthritis) at the same time it cured my cancer.  The old treatment?  Well CHOP Chemotherapy which I also got killed my memory and without the synergistic effect of Rituxan I would probably have relapsed by now.  I just think Big Business gets a bad rap in general from the liberal communist crowd and it is just not that way.  You have to take the good and the bad with all systems.  What would LeCarre have us put in place?  A system where the Government does all the research?  No Thanks.  My belief is I would be dead.  Since I believe it, it's true.  I'll take my chances with Big Pharma.  Meanwhile the weak minded soak up LeCarre's stories like they are fact, then point the finger at the multinationals, when it is all taken so grossly out of proportion.  So in telling well crafted lies which he terms fiction, LeCarre makes his living and in his way bilks the reader and does a disservice to the patient's suffering.  That's one way of looking at it anyway.  What system does he propose?  Communism?  No thanks we have been there and done that haven't we?  Don't get me wrong I liked the book and really want to see the movie.  It brought out the tragic beauty of Africa and the beauty of the depth of some of the relationships.  But I think there was a large dose of propaganda thrown in to boot 
 This ball is radio controlled with a remote that is about the size of a small cell phone. The ball has two small holes (smaller than the size of a dimple) on opposite sides that connect to a battery operated charger (2 AA). The remote uses a 9V battery. The ball has a small internal battery that apparently can be replaced if needed once it can longer hold a charge. The ball can be operated for a couple of minutes after a charge.   The ball is not meant to be hit, but probably can withstand a putter hit from a short distance. Because of a rolling weight and circuitry within the otherwise hollow ball, the ball does not roll straight on its own. The ball looks somewhat like a real ball but has a slightly off-white color and has an obvious seam.   When using the remote to control the ball, the ball revs up for 2-3 seconds by making a rattling sound, then it takes off still rattling away. An arrow on the ball is present to let you know the initial direction the ball will roll. You can reverse the ball's direction, but you can't make it go left or right.  The two biggest drawbacks of this gag ball are: 1. You can only direct the ball in two directions (front - back) with the remote. 2. A fairly loud rattling noise is made by the ball that probably can be heard from about 20 yards away.  As a gag ball, it seems like it is of only limited use. But for about $10, what more can I expect 
 Half of this book is simply the words of the Gospel of Mark, and half of the remaining half is a re-phrasing of Mark. The remaining quarter consists of Borg and Crossan offering their comments on the preceding portions. Anyone familiar with the Gospel of Mark will find nothing new here, and careful readers will find lots of errors of commission and omission. For example:  - They claim Mark was written "some 40 years after the life of Jesus (p. ix)" yet they offer no evidence for this theory except for the fact that Mark is a "wartime gospel." Indeed, the Jews were at war many times between 40 CE and 140 CE, so calling it a wartime gospel hardly qualifies for a date of 70 CE.   - They claim: "to narrow the passion of Jesus to his last 12 hours is to ignore the connection between his life and his death (p. vii)." True enough for a criticism of Mel Gibson's film, but equally true as a criticism of their book - a week is hardly enough to discuss Jesus' life.   - They claim the Gospel of Mark is "history remembered and history interpreted (p. ix)." True to a point, but many scholars will add that Mark contains later interpolations, a goodly copying from classic Greek texts, and a smattering of Mystery Religions in there as well. Mark is not simply history remember/interpreted.   - They claim that Pilate entered Jerusalem at the same time as Jesus, but from a different direction. This may be true, but there is no evidence for this theory.   - They claim: "For Rome's Jewish subjects, Pilates's procession embodied not only a rival social order, but also a rival theology (p. 3)." Nonsense.   - They claim Jewish rebels gained the name Zealots in the mid 1st Century (p. 21). Nonsense. The name was being used at the start of the 1st Century, and possibly earlier.   In addition to the many errors (I list only a few here), Borg and Crossan accept the Gospel of Mark uncritically. Many passages are obviously later additions, yet Borg and Crossan treat them as contemporary. They also accept Josephus' comments on Jesus to be from Josephus, while most scholars believe them to be later additions. Whether or not Mark and/or Josephus have later additions or not, Borg and Crossan at least need to raise the issue, rather than pretend that these passages are true to the originals.  This book has little to recommend it. There is no index, no reference list, and the notes section is very small. The writing appears often times to be dictation rather than writing, the errors are many, and the interpretations are so simple-minded that they add nothing. There are a few interesting sections (e.g., land ownership) but these are few and far in between. As an introduction to the Gospel of Mark, the book could be beneficial. It is easy to read and goes over the material thoroughly. 
 Yes, this is a good selection of songs from Sons of the Pioneers. Unfortunatly, the recording is also obviously created from old vinyl recordings. There is an unacceptable amount of hiss and popping on several tracks that really detracts from the music and I have yet to figure out if the recording is stereo (don't think so). I was really disappointed at the quality but for those of you who miss the nostalgia of a well-worn mono LP, give it a try. I doubt that I'll be listening to this CD much 
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 The theme is interesting, although unsubstantiated and weak.  For centuries, Mexican-American women have silently been shaping the cultural and economic development of the Southwest. These women have raised children who have integrated into the US culture, worked, built networks.  Their efforts have helped Mexican Americans find their own place in America. However, this book does not do the justice it probably had the intentions on doing.  The strong aspect of the book is the distinctive culture that has slowly gained momentum in the last Century. Either the strength just isn't there, or this author was not able to accurately portray it.  
     I hate to type this because I know from the book Melissa (the infinately more likable of the two) reads the reviews on Amazon.com, but this is tripe. This is a hideous vanity project and here is the secret of the book: You need to be HUGELY connected.  No matter what they tell you this is how they became (very marginally) famous:  They know famous gossip columnists, famous publicists, famous models, famous producers, pop culture icons, you name it, and THIS is what they use to get famous.  No average person in (lets just say)Suburban Nashville or Montana could possibly get remotely famous following their advice because they do not have friends who can get them HUUUGE free parties, slip their names into New York Magazine, etc.  They went to whealthy private schools where they made connections, worked for national publications, and OVER AND OVER they use those connections to get (very marginally)famous.  DO you know Molly Sims?  Would she come to your party?  Would famous artists paint your portrait? Major gossip columnists return your call?  The head of one of the biggest PR firms in the country joyfully throw a sponsored party for you because you have been good friends for six years?  Could your friends introduce you to some of the biggest movers and shakers in Hollywood?  No?  this book will be worthless to you..  Unless somehow you are unaware famous people are butt kissers with entourages and assistants.  There, I gave away all the secrets: Connections, connections, connections (Oh, lots of butt-kissing and an assistant and entourage). There are no secrets here, and by stating in the begining they are normal, average, nobodies, they are pretty much just..  lieing..  Though in the forward they come off as horribly deceptive talking about how they met (Uh huh, both desssperate to meet eachoter, and obsessed.  Right) and never regain credibility. I *want* to like Melissa (Cat's Meow is GREAT) and she seems really nice and self-effacting, but by participating in this book, I just can't 
 There are moments in this inconsequential 2005 comedy when I can see a bright future for Jennifer Aniston's light comedic talents, even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure "Friends" persona. She plays Sarah Huttinger, a likeably insecure New York Times obituary writer going home to Pasadena to attend her younger sister Annie's wedding. Sarah is picture-pretty, 33 and engaged to a nice, unflappable guy named Jeff who accompanies her. At the same time, she's unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out-of-sorts with her well-to-do family. A ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family, her feisty, tart-tongued grandmother Katherine, who tells Sarah about her late mother's pre-wedding tryst in Mexico that gives rise to questions about Sarah's paternity.  All the domestic shenanigans that ensue would probably be enough to fill this comedy's blessedly brief 96-minute running time, but screenwriter Ted Griffin hangs it all on the idea that Sarah's family may have been the inspiration for the Robinsons in Charles Webb's 1963 novel, "The Graduate", which of course, is the basis of Mike Nichols' classic 1967 movie. The tie-in must have sounded like a creative idea on paper, but something happened on the way to the screen that has taken most of the comic invention out of it. In fact, there is a pervasive lethargy throughout this movie, and director Rob Reiner is unable to overcome it because Sarah's dilemma of choosing between adventure and predictability never feels that emotionally resonant. The dialogue never feels sharp, perceptive or funny enough to pull off the inevitable comparisons with the earlier film. Moreover, the story is set rather arbitrarily in 1997 to make the timelines make sense with the stars' ages.  Beyond Aniston, a strong cast has been set adrift. Playing Katherine like an even more embittered variation on Aurora Greenway, Shirley MacLaine crackles with aplomb as the possible inspiration for Mrs. Robinson, even when her lines are not as snappy as she thinks they are. As the aging but still magnetic Benjamin Braddock doppelganger, a high-tech mogul named Beau Burroughs, an overly sedate Kevin Costner barely registers in a smallish role. When he does, there is an insinuating, almost creepy quality in the way Beau's relationship with Sarah evolves. Until the end, Mark Ruffalo has little to do as Jeff but wait patiently for Sarah to resolve her personal dilemma. Richard Jenkins and Mena Suvari have even less time to make an impression in the underwritten roles of Sarah's passive father and bubbly sister, respectively. The 2006 DVD provides the original theatrical trailer (which gives away most of the plot) as its sole extra 
 This book has to be one of the worst books I have ever read on the subject of Biblical history. I had to skip pages, then  a few chapters. The author keeps making the same petty arguments over and over, chapter after chapter. If you are looking for a piece of scholarly  work, you might want to look some where else, perhaps, "101 myths of the Bible." This book neither dissuades  the fundamentalist nor gives reasonable skeptic any new piece of information; it's just the author, - "trying" to use humor and endless sarcasm to formulate her theories. Perhaps, it would have been helpful for the author to demonstrate when and why these collection of writing became the foundation for most societies of the western world. If I took away one thing from this book this might be it: "...the bible is the most available, most purchased , and least read book in the wold." That said, no one needs this book, what one need is to actually read all the books of the bible(not paragraph and verses) with some healthy skepticism 
 This book is devoid of humor or insight. Save your money and apply it towards "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers.  I wish I had 
 I can see that whoever made this, put a lot of time and money into it trying to make this a big successful production, however, this fantasy film is best for ages 10 and under. Special effects, script lines, acting and story are significantly lacking what the blockbuster's have. Too bad.  
 Unless you have an older/inexpensive bathtub, this won't work. The side pad won't open wide enough to fit on a thicker rim and the seat won't go deep enough. Too bad. It looked great! 
 As a cat lover, I've enjoyed the Cat Who... books immensely.  However, this book left me with a lot of questions, and there were several items mentioned that were never resolved.  Homer Tibbet had been a prominent character in many of that series of books, he dies, and that's the last mention of him.  Surely, James MacIntosh Qwilleran would have attended his funeral!  Same thing for Liz Hart.  She's killed in a car accident, and that's the last we hear of her.  What about the impact of her death on Derek Cuttlebrink,another prominent character in this series?  We've read all these books, these characters have become important to us, and suddenly we're left hanging in these relationships.  I'll continue to read the new books, but they're clearly not what they were even 3 or 4 years ago 
 as I did when the criminal's motive was revealed. In the first place, the criminal was totally obvious, yet when the moment of denouement came I was dumbstruck, and not in a good way. I guess sometimes *fiction* is stranger than *truth* in spite of the old cliche.   I greatly, greatly enjoyed the Mrs. Murphy mysteries for the first several books, but all good things must come to an end, and my enjoyment certainly did. After finishing "Sour Puss" I went to my bookshelf and pulled out "Wish You Were Here" and began re-reading it. I was really surprised at how much the series has changed since its beginnings. A good many of the characters have strayed so far from their original characterizations as to be almost brand new people.  Naturally one would expect the characters to evolve as do all people.  I really do miss Harry being at the heart of the town of Crozet...she never should have left the post office.  As always, the animals' observations are the only reason why I continue reading 
 Elizabeth Gould Davis' book THE FIRST SEX is the author's assertion that prehistory was matriarchal and that women are physical, mentally, and morally superior to men. Her aim is already questionable, for who would want to say one half of the human race is superior to the other, and her manner of carrying out the argument is ineffective.  The problems with the book are manifold, and the difficulty in describing them all lies in where to even start. For one, Davis does not appear to have been qualified to write a book based on archeological and historical data, for being a common librarian she had no specialized training in the subjects. With no proficiency with, for example, Latin she has to interpret ancient sources by translations, and in one bizarre passage suggests that only women translators are capable of producing reliable results. While later saying that Christianity was made up entirely, she takes everything written in other ancient sources as dry fact insisting, for example, that the Amazons existed while most experts would now hold that they were a mere fanciful myth.   Within the field of biology, her limited knowledge of the field and the outdatedness of her sources results in tired assertions such as that all children regardless of gender begin at conception as female, which modern science has shown to be a misconception based on visual appearance when there is always a clear genetic distinction.  Davis makes a number of curious sidetracks into areas for which she simply has a personal distaste, even if they have no relation to her thesis. Christianity and Judaism particularly suffer. Her feelings for Judaism appalingly approach anti-semitism, with Jews being portrayed as distasteful and shifty barbarians whose ideas, introduced to the civilized (i.e. matriachal) world resulted in its downfall. Then with Christianity she does what she can to belittle it, calling it "the barbarous religion" and reducing all the sundry denominations of the faith into one single doctrine of evil. At times, this results in obvious contradictions, as when she writes that Christians made up stories of persecution and were really treated well in Rome, and then a mere couple of pages later notes that several Roman emperors persecuted Christians to a great degree.  Finally, Davis drops a long expected bombshell in her afterword by proclaiming that we are now "on the threshold of the new Age of Aquarius", reducing what wasn't even a passable academic work to mere new-age claptrap.  THE FIRST SEX, in the three decades since its appearance, has been extensively debunked, and thankfully contemporary readers are more likely to approach it through first hearing that it is nonsense. Cynthia Eller's THE MYTH OF MATRIARCHAL PREHISTORY is the most detailed of these critical examinations and essential reading if you intend on perusing Davis' book. Eller's book is admirable in that it shows how these crank ideas, by basing hopes upon an imaginary past, are actually harming the possibility of creating a just and equal society in the future.  Davis' is a book of already objectionable premise made terrible by its spiteful tone and disregard for academic standards, and the ease by which it has been debunked. I really cannot recommend THE FIRST SEX; even for those looking for opposing voices in anthropological study there are better, more trustworthy works 
 This book is not even worth turning the first page!  This is one of those books where you actually feel embarrassment for the author.  The book is poorly researched, poorly written, poorly edited, and well...... words just fail me.  While I am not a great Herriot fan, I do have to give him, Herriot his due, the man could write well and could tell a great story (isn't that what authors are suppose to do?).  This guy though, Graham Lord, I suspect, has problems feeding the paper into his typewriter!  The entire book is such a obvious ploy to make some quick money on the shirttail of a "dead" but popular author it is rather nauseating.  Shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work!  I did finish the book though (thank God I did not purchase the thing) because each page became worse and worse and I could not stop, my thinking being with each turn of the page "well it just cannot be any worse than that last page/chapter."  How wrong I was!  If you must read the thing, borrow it or check it out of the library.  I would hate to see a person waste their money, and I certainly  would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this.  Herriot's life, warts and all, could be such a fastinating subject.  I do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually.  We certainly did not get it here.  I just hate having to give this one even one star.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 I will not buy this, or any other CD, that contains predatory software that makes the buyer vulnerable to spyware, viruses, and other PC problems.  Talk about lousy customer service!  What is Sony trying to protect?  It was proven during the days of cassettes that convenience copying does not hurt the music industry.  Those who would pirate the music, large scale, will find a way around the copy protection anyway.  We consumers are the only losers 
 If you are an Exchange Administrator who wants to upgrade his support skills to Exchange 2003 this book is too basic.  Case in point, Chapter 10 Monitoring Exchange Server 2003.  "... Windows Server 2003 records many events in its own event logs."... "Windows maintains three distinct logs" (Application, Security, and System) "You will encounter five types of events in the three logs, and a unique icon identifies each event type so that you can easily disntiguish between the information entries and the error entries"  Aften times you find the author explaining the screen print of a properties page that is right below the text you are reading.  News flash we see the picture, don't tell us what tabs there are and what buttons there are, tell us what they do, and when should we use them.  The font is nice and big, and the book makes a good book end for other more useful texts 
 This is, without question, the WORST book ever written on one's financial life.  To begin with, it's useless: ZERO information, ZERO new analysis of old information, ZERO advice, ZERO interesting anecdotes.  Additionally, it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data, to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering.  What exactly is this guy's point?   No way to tell.  Seriously, this book is SO BAD that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have, in my opinion, lost all remaining credibility.   What a waste of my $16 and 4 hours.  I want my money and time back. 
 I was not nearly as enamored with this book as most of the reviewers below. The biggest problem for me is that Alice simply was not a sympathetic character. She whines and excuses her bad behavior all the way through. She also covers up for and excuses the deplorable behavior of her near-do-well son. The only sympathetic character was the husband, who I sided with and felt extremely sorry for throughout the entire story. Her trips to the shrink are boring and add little to the story. I also thought that Alice was ridiculously over dramatic about the "secret" from her childhood she finally remembers, and overly dramatic about the death of her parents, as if she is the only person in the world who has ever suffered these experiences. Woe is me! Sounded like a pity party to me. All and all, not a winning story line, although the writing itself was really good. Perhaps I'll try one of her previous books and see if the story is better. 
 The standard version of "Japanese for Busy People 1" has kana and romanization. This book just has the romanization removed. By adding "kana version" to the title they make sound as if the other version doesn't have kana. I say if you don't like the romanization then just don't use it. How is a beginner supposed to use this book? Especially a busy beginner 
 Two stars for what its worth. I'm dissatisfied with the way this book is written. Its not straight to the point and lacks substance. Although some chapters proved to be informative like (i.e. chapter one: foundations) they could still be found from other resources like the internet (and its free!!). (translation: i regret having spent my money on this book).  The book was a dissapointment i thought id be reading the thoughts of a real seasoned expert, i was wrong.  Now Veen will be in my "ignore the books of this writer" list 
 "Big Cotton" and US agricultural subsidies are big news in the world of trade. Yafa teases a promise to enlighten on this situation, but fails to deliver.  Yafa knows there is a big and tangled picture here to illustrate, but is unable to work out the world view and settles instead for a series of scenes in cotton's long history. The start of the industrial revolution in England, the rise of Lowell, MA, the beginning of Levi Straus & Co are written as grand chapters containing some amusing anecdotes, but sitting in isolation.  In the final chapters, pesticides and genetically-modified cotton appear, largely wrapped in a diatribe on the evils of both rather than any real analysis. Yafa has left out how the South changed from a resion of sharecroppers pre-WW II to industrial farming by the mid-50's.  Most disappointing are the final chapters on the current world trade. There is a complex story to be told here of US politics and farming as well as farming in Africa. Yafa misses most of this. The devil is in the details of most of this story. With few if any numbers and no detail of costs or pricing Yafa cannot capture this story. It does not lend itself to a journalistic approach, although Yafa's refernces to stories in the Wall Street Journal suggest that the WSJ writers may have written a better piece on the subject than "Big Cotton".  Meanwhile, Yafa purports to tell a tale worldwide in scope, yet his "Big Cotton" is really a US story. After 300 pages of almost exclusively US tales we are told that China is the biggest current producer. Where did the Chinese industry come from? Or Pakistan's or India's?  If you are looking for the story of cotton, keep looking - this is not the book 
 I had quite high hopes for this little kit given the phenomenal Dragonology. However, it is genuinely disappointing. The kit includes a nice plastic talisman with crystal, a package of dragon powder, a dragon rune decoder and a small 2 inch x 2 inch book of spells. For the suggested retail of $8.99, it's pretty overpriced, and the items are small enough that one wonders why they weren't incorporated into the Dragonology books in the first place. Surely with three books, filled with secret compartments, one could have found space for these 
 As is obvious from his title, Mr. Helminiak believes that he is able to provide special insight regarding Biblical teaching on homosexuality.  But he makes clear from the beginning that he does not really care what the Bible says: "As a Roman Catholic - and more importantly, a thinking person - I do not presume the Bible has the last word on sexual ethics" (19).  He approaches the Biblical text as though it had no Divine origin whatsoever.  He relegates God's description of homosexuality as "abomination" (Lev. 18:22; 20:13; cf. Prov. 6:16) to the Israelites' personal qualms about such activity: "The early Israelites considered it unclean. They thought it was dirty. They prohibited it not because it was wrong in itself but because it offended their religious worldview" (63).  Of course, God had no problems with offending the Israelites' religious worldview (cf. Ex. 32).  Helminiak will deny authorship of a passage if it conflicts with his prejudice.  In asserting that the sin of Sodom was actually "inhospitality," he cites a few passages (including the non-canonical Book of Wisdom) and concludes "The Bible often uses Sodom as an example of the worst sinfulness, but the concern is NEVER simply sexual acts" (49).  But in this section, Helminiak fails even to consider Jude 7, which establishes beyond a shadow of a doubt that the sin and punishment of Sodom concerned sexual sins.  Obviously, I cannot endorse a book that violates Biblical teaching.  But for one looking to justify what the Bible clearly condemns, perhaps a better effort is made elsewhere 
 Under the Volcano is a great novel--one of my favorites. But this edition has many, many spelling errors and typos...so many that they're a distraction. It's a shame, because otherwise I think this edition's design is clean and very readable. Definitely read the book if you're interested, but not this edition 
 After a hilarious opening chapter its all downhill.  A long long road with not much to see along the way.  I reread the first chapter often and have had many others do the sam 
 I am a fan of Coetzee and have read many of his previous works and loved them.  Disgrace is one of my all-time favourites but this one left me feeling cheated.  The book began with promise and I loved his characterizations of Paul and Marijana but with the introduction of the mysteriour Elizabeth, the book began to spiral downward and didn't bounce back.  I had to struggle to finish it and felt let down.  I wouldn't recommend this for my book group, which is why I wanted to read it.  We loved discussing his other works.   Maybe I wasn't in the mood to delve into the inner psyches of the characters but this one left me cold 
 I find it interesting that the author would make such a wonderful effort to help children, after having murdered parents. I wonder if he sent autographed free copies to the children of the people he murdered.   I also find it interesting, that in over 20 years on death row, he was only able to write a handful of "children's books".   That these books would find their way into our public school systems, where this man takes on the role of Martyr and Folk Hero, speaks volumes about our schools.  The book is as shallow as the man who wrote it 
    Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 Although Scott's story is interesting, I had a hard time relating to it (even as a Protestant who is going through the process of converting to Catholicism).  He assumes the reader has a thorough background in Protestant theology and will be familiar with the ins and outs of delicate biblical arguments.  Each chapter is split, with 3/4 of the chapter being Scott's story and the last 1/4 being Kimberly's version.  This can get confusing when trying to remember who is talking.  Personally, not recommended 
 IRS Form 1023 is one of the most important pieces of starting a nonprofit organization. Yet this book, which is stamped with a 2005 copyright, contains information for the outdated, pre-2004 version of the 1023.  For example, the advice is given that one can attach a form SS-4 (request for EIN) with the form 1023, and in the form 1023 state "SS-4 attached" when it asks for an SS-4. Wrong. The IRS now requires an EIN be registered prior to submitting a 1023.  Likewise, the hints about "Part this" and "Question that" are completely out of sync with the actual application.  Grudgingly, I give the author credit for the other parts of the book. But 1023 is so important, that it would be terrible to let anyone rely on the information in this book.  A good source of detailed, up-to-date information on the 1023 is "IRS Form 1023 Tax Preparation Guide" by Jody Blazek. And I also recommend the companion book by the same author, "IRS Form 990 Tax Preparation Guide for Nonprofits".  Get those books. Do not get this book 
 If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others 
 The light was very good, the magnifier (very tiny) made of plastic which was optically difficult to look thru if you already wear glasses.  But the worst part were the tweezers in themselves.  They were difficult to squeeze togeter because of their placement on the handle.  Also, I am used to sharp tweezers that come together tightly over the hair.  These did not.  So they do not tweeze well at all.  Wasn't worth all the bother of a return.  I just threw it away.  It was a good idea for a product, just poorly made.  
 I bought 4 other head first series books, java, EJB, Design pattern, and Servlet. These books were fast, funny and of course, informative. I really love these series. However, when I read this book I was so disappointed. Most explanations are redundant and it made me boring and the reading pace was suspended. I think the author have to add more examples and shorten the explanation. I regret to buy this book. Not recommended. 
 This is misleading...not even 5% of the Ruskin masterwork is printed in this book.  
 The Monk In The Garden by, Robin Marantz Henig, is a good book surrounded by a more boring, speculative one. At the core of this "novel," of course, was the explanation of the life and times of Gregor Mendel that helped procure his work on genetics. However, concealing this was much fluff, and unnecessary banter from Henig. The story of the monk growing his peas is a familiar one, to any person having passed a high school biology class, yet the purpose of this novel was to delve further into the unknown to see a side that we have never previously seen. While at times, Henig creates lighthearted descriptions of his rotund body, or widening face, for the most part she generalizes and presupposes that Mendel spent his time looking at objects out windows. For having lived so very long ago, it is amazing someone has been able to so accurately describe their daily life, and without ever meeting them as well? Now if she could only do the same for the many other illusive historical figures.   After reading some reviews, I too picked up on a certain religious bias held by Henig. She seemingly had two agendas in writing this book, both uncovering Mendel's life and work, and discrediting Christianity at any point possible.   While trying to be entertaining, Henig still uses excessively large vocabulary at points, and seems to be mixed up, and frazzled when it comes to her explaining important concepts. Still eagerly trying to explain genetics, Mendel, and how Christianity is wrong, she seems to forget that not everyone reading this book has a PhD in molecular biology. Henig seems to have failed as both a geneticist, and a novelist. Harsh, yet someone publishing a nonfiction book should be 110% sure everything is both correct, and at least factual based on primary resources, not made up chitchat. Plus its just plain boring 
 First, let me say that I was VERY impressed with the shipping speed of this hat, which was nice because I bought this as a last-minute gift. Though, with that said, there is a BIG difference between straw and straw-paper. This hat is straw-paper. I'm afraid to see what will happen once this hat gets wet from sweat or rain. I really think Amazon should improve this hat's description 
 I just did not like this book at all.  Children should not be having parliments.  What foolishness this all was.  All it does is prove the point that children cannot and should not rule.  They are imature!  The ending was bad too.  I hate books with bad endings.  Don't waste your money like I did. 
 I installed the card and my computer recognized it just fine.  However, the computer wouldn't recognize anything that I plugged in using the firewire cable.  So I bought a new cable at Walmart, and sure enough, it worked like a charm.    The whole reason I bought this was because the cable was included.  That was a mistake.  
 The book starts off decent, then becomes useless dribble, How a ghost hunter can believe in ghosts and then proceed to say that all spirit communication is the work of satan and evil demons is pure nonsense, discarnate humans show up fo his amusement but only demons show up for Spiritualist seances, pure junk ! he also attacts the occult sciences as means for demon obsession, and claims Witchcraft is the work of the devil, what is this guy doing living in the 13 century ? or just spotting off christian bigotry ? oh, and by the way, going to cemetaries to look for ghosts is like going to candy stores looking for sugar, get real, either ghosts exist or they don't, oh, I also liked the way he sumed up psychics as useless con men. it just proves that any one can write a book and claim to be an expert.need I say more ?  don't waste your money 
 Since I was going to Ireland on a self-drive vacation, when I saw this book on the shelf I grabbed and bought it immediately.  I studied the book before leaving the US, deciding that several of the tours suited my needs.  What a disappointment, however, upon getting to Ireland and trying to actually use the book.  Directions from the book itself were not very helpful, we got lost several times, only finding our way back using a regular road map.  The book mentions Routes that have no signs posted anywhere, so it was hard to know if you were going the right way.  I agree with the reviewer who pointed out that there was not nearly enough information about each suggested "stop" on the tours - hard to decide whether it was worth it or not to make the 10-mile detour to check things out.  I could have also used some kind of description about the road conditions, such as if it was a mountain road, straight, or with many curves - those things definitely affected driving times 
 There's not much this film can offer, unless its some cool-looking British sedans and OK to decent character actors. Quyale is utterly wasted. Jayne is, well, Jayne, and the plot is pretty weak. As far as the picture & sound quality, let's not even go there... 
 This book was entertaining, but pretty useless. Most of the "advice" consists of personal accounts of Ms. Grant's own writing experiences, with very specific details as to how she came up with all her plots (and very minor attempts to translate this into beneficial knowledge for the reader). It could serve as a decent catalog if you were shopping for her books. She manages to make some useful points about designing characters to produce conflict, but she misuses vocabulary words on more than one occasion, lacks focus and flow, and really doesn't include any other valuable content. I finally had to quit reading when she started explaining how to use the "omnipotent" viewpoint (which is presumably one where the narrator can do anything?). "How To Write Romances" by Phyllis Taylor Pianka is the way to go for books of this sort, despite it not having quite as cheezy a cover as this one 
     This CD sucks. Even the title is gay. Listen to Endeavor on the Frailty of Words. It is by far their best song and CD. 
 I'm a huge fan of the Pria line, but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy.  I don't hate them, but will not buy them again.  The flavor is pretty good though, just not what I was expecting.  I highly recommend the Pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind. Thank 
 I travel for work, so I often rely on fitness DVDs to help me stay in shape. I've only been working out seriously for a few months, and this DVD is definitely too easy for me.  There are 2 cardio workouts, 5 toning work outs, a warm up, a cool down, and an all over toning workout.  This seems great, but when you actually look at the details, you'll see that the cardio workouts are only 13 minutes each, and the toning workouts are only 5 minutes each. So when you actually look at the pre-set workouts (without warm up and cool down), you're only getting about 20 minutes of real exercise.  I would say this is a good DVD if you've never exercised or you are really out of shape.  But even if you've been exercising for a little while, you'll probably find it too easy.  I strongly recommend The method cardio bootcamp, or 10 minute solutions carb burner, or 10 minute solutions pilates.  All three of these videos will give you the ability to choose your workouts or combine smaller segments into a longer workout.  If you're looking for a good toning workout, try Self Bikini Ready Fast.  
 The archaeologists say that there is no record for invasion/immigration  then why should Flood use that as the centre piece of his analytical  framework for the development of Hinduism 
 Will various banal interpersonal conflicts of a personal nature all turn out for the best in idyllic fantasyland Cape Light?  Just as surely as Thomas Kinkade will get millions more dollars selling holiday pennants, air fresheners, Christmas choo-choo trains, and overpriced prints of his egregiously sappy artwork!  In this volume, the good people of the village of cozy cottages, old-tyme independent businesses, and upright churchgoers face yet another harrowing dilema!  Should they be evil hypocritical secular humanist snobs and turn away a new center for troubled teens?  Or should they do the right thing and trust in providence and be welcoming?  What do you think?  Do you really need to shell out bucks and read this schmaltzy little screed to find out?  Thomas Kinkade is reportedly worth $75 million.  Why further enrich him 
 Another enjoyable read, quicker than most because you don't have to think. It's not much of a mystery, and the Siamese cats really have little to do with its solution but provide a clever title. Mostly they give Braun a chance to ooh and ahh over the inexplicable ways of cats. It was many books ago that Koko actually provided a useful clue to his host, Mr. Q, the genial bachelor billionaire who is every tame girl's wish. Mostly this is a tale from Moose County, 400 miles north of anywhere. If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is certainly not right place for you to pick up this series.    Brrr is celebrating its 200th anniversary with Scots, a giant cake, bland good will from everyone, and Qwilleran's second historical disaster radio show up on stage. That's pretty exciting, too, when we get to hear the whole script. Oh, sure, there's a bad happening or two in town, but don't let that put you off for they occur well out of view. There's also good times with Q's good friends, and a subplot about an old lady, her fabulous antiques, and her mercenary granddaughter. There's no significant development in the relationships among any of Braun's stock characters--you know who I mean. To top off a pleasantly fluffy read, Braun appends two of Q's favorite delicious recipes. A quintessential summer beach read, guaranteed to pass a few hours pleasantly. 
 This book is a total waste of paper.  I feel sorry for anyone who reads it, and am shocked that people actually found this book useful. It is the worst piece of literature I have ever read in my life.  The styles and techniques profiled border on the absurd. I am indeed dumber for having read this piece of garbage. I would reccomend that anyone who thinks about buying this book should just watch Samuri Jack on cartoon network as his style is probably more believable than the laughable techniques "revealed" in this waste of ink 
 But, still, don't waste your money. If you must read this, get it from the library and buy a book here from a real American like Al Franken 
 Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon 
 I read to Repel Ghosts and thought it was okay. It is a bit phony for someone like Kevin Young who comes from such a privileged life to write about street life as if he had ever experienced it. I sure did and this book felt like it totally romanticized Basquiat. I found little in Kevin Youngs own words. This book simply gives you a safe and untrue moment that is in a way enough for many, but not sincere enough for me 
 From reading the reviews of Santa Evita, one might actually conclude that the book is about her, about her life or about her times.  And that would be a mistake.  This novel is fundamentally about itself, making constant references to the writing of it, other writings, other authors, the process of writing, and other writings of this author.  I found the transitions out of context and jarring, as though I was being suddenly reminded that I was reading a book.  After a while, I found the de-constructing of Evita to be tiresome and not very original.  The subject of Evita Peron's life is an extremely colorful, bizarre and fascinating story in and of itself.  Somehow, I felt that the author had utilized this famous and powerful legend to manipulate the reader.  The segments of the narrative which are more "straight" and not self referential, are extremely compelling.  Then suddenly, I felt I had been caught in a mouse trap of deconstructionist trickery, and that Martinez had "used" his purported subject as a piece of cheese to lure me in.  Not nice.  
 I had not read this author and was so disappointed in this book I have returned it to Amazon, even though I will be out the shipping costs!  It is written as though talking to and written by a 6 year old.  I am insulted that she would even think an adult would read this book.  I recommend you do not waste your money. If you can't make an art journal, visit the many wonderful on-line websites that will teach you how for free, and offer guidance by other on-line journalers and artists. This book is a total waste of money 
  I've come across Chris Potter by chance,following Dave Holland recordings,and knowing nothing of the artist until the past few days,when I received my CDs,ordered in November(!). Unfortunately it takes sometime to get things by mail over here, in Kuwait, where I live, but it has been worth the wait!  The drumming and bass(7.5) remind me of a powerful recording of "Impressions",of McCoy Tyner memory(Trident was the vinyl),with Elvin Jones and Ron Carter to complete the trio. Potter's quartet,though playing with the same vigour, has different touches: piano wizard Hays plays like old time virtuoso Oscar Peterson and Potter like 1/3 Coltrane + 1/3 of Joshua Redman + 1/3 Brandford Marsalys(and what a nice cocktail!). All in all this album was a really wonderful surprise,for someone like myself that knew nothing about Potter. And music with the 3Bs:Beautiful,Beautiful, Beautiful. I love fast pace swing,and this album has plenty of it,but not only. PS: THE RATING WAS SUPPOSED TO SHOW 5 stars,NOT 2(?).My mouse must have slipped at the wrong moment. 
 This CD is remixed and edited to the point where most of the songs are choppy and the music drowns out the voices. This happens especially with Tony Braxton's Unbreak My Heart - though this is one of the most enjoyable remixes.  Also, there's a monotone quality to the rhythm and flow that becomes tedius quickly.  I expected to find Duran Duran's Sunrise to be simply a toss-in filler, but it's quite good. And Dido's White Flag is wonderfully done- though cut a bit short.  The remainder went under "Disable Selected Tracks" -- a lot of divas caterwauling through some of the dumbest lyrics I've ever had to struggle to hear. Alice Keys featuring Tony! Toni! Tone'! and Diary reaches new highs for repetitive drivel.  A waste of money.      
 This was my first Carlotta Carlyle book, and I thought it was boring. I will not read another one. I love murder/mystery books and this was not a page turner. The ending was very disappointing 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 Okay, you may think that I do not appreciate the so-called classics, but I have to be honest--I simply cannot stand this book. The language is so bad, and even the ending is horrible. The only good thing I can say about the whole thing is that it's very short. It's only a few chapters long, and that's it.   I read this book with my English class in high school, and reading it once was more than enough for me. Not to diss John Steinbeck or anything like that, but this book is one of the worst books in all of literature. I don't even understand why they call this lame piece of work a "classic". 
 I  liked Yate's novel "Revolutionary Road" very much, but found Easter Parade  disappointing. Lots happens in a short book, and Yates exhibits the clean, simple prose style of a good crime writer. Looking back, at the end of the novel, I was touched by all the fruitless effort Emily Grimes had put into establishing a satisfying long term relationship, only to be thwarted by the limitations of the men in her life.  Yet Yates is really writing about people, not making them come alive as well developed characters.  When Emily turns her back on her sister, which should be a major event, it is almost casually dismissed.  "The Easter Parade" is readable, but it is not good literature. 
 Get the other one by Dennis Ricthie for a C reference manual.  This one is very difficult to follow 
 Literary arrogance at its height, this book takes simple concepts and makes them obtuse.  If that is an accomplishment, then I'll grant the praise.  I would prefer some of her contemporaries like Waugh or Cathers who's prose gives me far more pleasure without the hubris - and in the end teaches me far more about life, and writing.  Don't be intimidated by pedants who call this great, trust your own judgement and the emperor's clothes reveal themselves for what they aren't. 
 Battlefield Earth is an adaptation of the book by L. Ron Hubbard.   While the book was a rather interesting story about humans, led by Jonnie Goodboy Tyler, taking back Earth from the Psychlos, the film has turned the story into a string of badly filmed action sequences, with silly camera angles and awful editing. The Psychlos already have human workers before capturing Jonnie. This change in the story serves no purpose but makes the story even more messy. The film then focuses on some of the story elements in the book, but leaves most of it out, including the entire last half.   Considering this was a dream project for John Travolta, it's strange that he would let the book be made into such a bad movie, especially such a silly one. While the book was not without flaws, it was actually pretty good, but the movie is for the most part more or less incompetently made. The director, writers and editors all did a bad job. It does have some entertainment value though, which keeps me from giving it the lowest rating. 
 Though this item may be a piece of junk, I just wanted to clarify something for everyone. Steel will always rust, even the "stainless" steels. However, it is more resistant to rusting so long as you care for the item. For example: Dont leave in a the sink for too long, dont leave it outside in the rain or a puddle of water because it will rust. 
 This book basically describes single women in midlife as uniformly content, financially well-off, healthy, and lovin' it. While I think this may be true for a significant proportion of us, I absolutely know it's not true for all. Considering this book was written by a social worker, it does nothing to address the very real societal and economic problems that affect single, middle-aged women. It's a little too biased and a little too gung-ho 
 The first two Betsy Taylor books were short but packed with humor and action.  I've re-read them both several times, and still love them.  This one? It seems like she whipped it off in less than a month, and didn't put the care and craftsmanship into it that she did the others.  The plot is thin, the characters far less developed, and the book is overall a disappointment, especially in light of how excellent her first two Vampire Queen books were.  Sadly, the fourth book in the series, Undead and Unreturnable, is even worse.  I advise anyone wanting to read either Unappreciated or Unreturnable to get them from the library--they are not worth buying.  Try Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking instead, or Katie McAlister's You Slay Me if you want something lighter, and hope that MJD gets her act together and starts writing well again 
 I wrote a huge review for this and don't know where it is but let me give you the short version.  They don't continue the story, that is until the end of the movie.  AND THAT WAS THE PART TRHAT RUINED THE MOVIE FOR ME. The movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married.  Enter the Bride.  She of course doesn't want anybody to be happy so...  The story is not really worth going over, it is just injected and there are no real emotions.  Except of course for an ending that really PO'ed me.  The only reason this movie gets a 2 stars and almost gets a 3 is for Christy Chung.  Not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth, she is a great actress.  So I know of 2 movies now that are only worth watching for her, this and Red Wolf.  It may be because the people she works with are so terrible, but to tell the truth, Christy Chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time.  Not a big deal since it was only like a 77 minute long movie.  
 Replaced first spindle and still junk. Will always stick with Verbatim from now on 
  After two months my conclussion was that I could see no change what-so-ever. Typically Neutrogena is quality, but not this time. Now you can't say you weren't warned 
 These guys have to be the blueprint for all the hilarious cheesy songs the Southpark guys use on their TV show and in "Team America".  You can't find much rock n' roll music that is weaker than Nightranger.  And to think this is the greatest hits!  Horrible, horrible music.   Back in the 80's when everyone was listening to this instead of the Replacements it was laughable.  20 years later it's even more laughable and shocking.  The ONLY way anyone could enjoy this would be listening in a nostalgiac sense.  If you were 12 in 1985 
 As is sometimes the case, the title of this book is somewhat misleading.  Having read several books which were generally favorable to Greenspan I thought this one might give a balance counter view.  Overall, it turned out to quite a disappointment.  In the first few pages Professor Batra made it clear that he thinks he is probably more qualified to be the Fed Chairman than Greenspan.  On page 1 he says "He had not done any path-breaking work in economics, at least not that was commonly cited."  On page 3 he says "It could explain how he had advanced so far without sufficient credentials; how his extraordinary career appeared to derive crucially not from merit but from favoritism and connections".  Also on page 3 -"Greenspan did not even have a Ph.D. at the time; nor had he penned anything pioneering to earn the recognition of his peers".  On page 7 I again knew the book was in trouble when Batra stated "...because in my view intelligence and integrity go together".  Does anyone actually believe that all dishonest people are dumb?  On page 9 Batra made it clear that the book was as much, or more, about his economic philosophy than it was about Greenspan when he wrote "In fact, I will offer a new economic paradigm to cure the global stagnation that has resulted from tax trade, and monetary policies inspired by Greenspan".  He does offer a paradigm; unfortunately, real world experience shows that the paradigm does not to work as he postulates.  Clearly, the book is attempting to put forth his agenda.  As the rest of the book demonstrates, Professor Batra is a fairly strong liberal in whose world the working poor will spend all additional income and the idle rich will simply put extra income under their mattress.  He regularly harps on reducing income taxes on the "poor" and increasing them on the "rich" and "big businesses".  As recently as 2003, the Congressional Budget Office documented that the bottom 40% to 50% of the population pay little or no taxes while the upper income individuals and businesses pay the vast majority.  How the government could reduce the taxes on people who do not pay taxes is never addressed.  Professor Batra does correctly point out that the Social Security tax is quite regressive.  In order to discredit Greenspan, Batra gives Greenspan gives Greenspan far more power than is warranted.  Throughout the book, Batra tries to convince us that the President and Congress did whatever Greenspan might suggest or support.  As written, the book makes one believe that Batra never watched Greenspan testify before Congress where the congressmen tried to get Greenspan to support their way of thinking.  Basically, Batra tries to blame Greenspan for all of the acts of Congress.  Batra's new paradigm he calls Economic Democracy.  In this Economic Democracy the Federal Government would buy most of the stock of the large companies and then give it, or sell it at a big discount, to the employees of the companies.  That way the employees would be in control rather than the CEOs and boards of directors.  Clearly, Professor Batra is not living in the real world.  In the real world most of the employees who were given the stock would simply sell it in fairly quick order and that, of course, would return things to where they originally were.  For many years I was an "employee owner" of the nations largest totally employee owned company and I can attest that they do not operate in any way close to what Professor Batra assumes.  The good professor needs to get out his ivory tower and get a job in the real world.  If you want to learn about Greenspan, this is NOT the book to read.  Save your money. 
 As a child, Ellen G. White was severely hurt, even disfigured, when a schoolmate hit her in the face with a large rock.  Could this have been the reason for her subsequent "visions" (some of us might call these hallucinations)?  Just a thought . . . .  If you bought and read this book, you've got way too much time on your hands.  Frankly, I'd rather peruse my local phone directory than submit to this author's view of the world 
 Short choppy sentences with one page in color and the next in black and white left me wishing this book was done differently.  Loving nature, I wanted to really enjoy this story, but I didn't.  There were facts thrown in haphazardly with thoughts and there was absolutely no reason for the black and white harsh transition every other page into color.  I just didn't get the concept the illustrator was trying to portray.  I did like that the pages were made out of paper that felt like it was recycled just for this tree story.  And the introduction of, "Trees are very nice. They fill up the sky." was a nice way to start this book, and the ending of, "They wish they had one so they go home and plant a tree too." leaves you with a positive activity, but the rest of it was drab for me 
 This book was poorly written drivel.  I didn't even finish this it disgusted me so.  I want to make sure no one else has to go through the torture of reading that.  And is it just me or is the science vessel named  after a Spice Girl (Victoria Adams)? I will never buy another novell  written by her/them ever again.  It hadn't even talked about the day of  honor and I was about halfway through 
 There will always be the question of importance between sports and money.  Which is more important?  Do today's players participate because they love the game, or is it because they are thrown millions of dollars to play?  It is a question that will continue to be a part of our culture as long as million dollar contracts are signed.  I couldn't help but think of this concept as I watched this film.  In 1919 the players of a winning Chicago baseball team decided to throw in their chances of a World Series title just to earn some extra cash for their pockets.  The results of this game lead to interrogations, an appointment of a baseball commissioner, and a decree that would punish these ball players for the rest of their lives.  For those of us that were not around in 1919 to experience this event first hand, director John Sayles has decided to show us the events first hand through dry cinematography, horrific acting, and a drama that is lacking in ... well ... drama.  One of my favorite John Sayles films is Sunshine State.  In it, Sayles takes characters and gives them so much emotion and spirit that you are literally pulled off your couch and glued to the television for the entire two hours.  I wish this were the case for Eight Men Out.  Sadly, where this film lacks is confident actors and a intense and knowledgeable screenplay.  You could tell from the beginning that this topic was a passion of Sayles, but that he also had trouble directing it.  It didn't seem to move as smoothly as some of his other work.  I think one of the main reasons is due to the players that are under his lead.  These are not dramatic actors, but instead some of the "hottest" talent that 1988 had to offer.  I kept thinking that he was trying to compete with the 80s teen idols film that was released the same year called Young Guns.  He wanted to have a film that brought those normally not interested in a film of this kind into the theater.  Hey, it worked for me.  John Cusack is not a dramatic character, while later in his career he reaches this level, at this point in his life he is still has that persona of a imaginative teen.  This causes his "big" dramatic scenes to seem less and less relevant when they are presented.  Charlie Sheen's accent faded in and out throughout this entire film, while D.B. Sweeney couldn't shake the cliché ways of his character's lack of education.  Instead of being dramatic, I found myself full of laughter.  I needed stronger actors to pull this film from out of left field.  Finally, for those seeking a gritty drama about the hardships of "rigging" a game, do not look in this direction.  This is not an Oliver Stone film, this is John Sayles, which means that he is incapable of pushing any buttons.  There were so many directions and dark alleyways that he could have taken us with this film.  I wanted to know more about how these eight men won the trial, I wanted to know more about the confessions, I wanted to know more about the industry, but nothing was handed to me.  I just had to deal with ignorant characters that were about to get five years in prison for their crimes, and nobody was worried.  It infuriated me when the ball players walked into the courtroom and it was nothing but a joke and media frenzy.  It seemed like they didn't care about the trial at all, so which left me no choice but to not care either.  I dislike sports films immensely, and this film is one of the reasons why!  Grade:  * out of **** 
 I bought these for my husband and the color said rinse so I thought regular jean color. In fact they were so dark that they almost look black. I have washed then about 5 times but they won't fade 
 This book was extremely boring. It took a long time to finish because I had a hard time forcing myself to continually pick it up. I appreciate differing views, but authors should at least be honest with their intentions. Despite what they say, the "facts" offered in this text contained loads of speculation and make a mockery of anyone that found evidence contrary to their own. The points that they seemed to weigh on the heaviest had less tangible evidence and more biased option then the rest. With all do respect to the authors, I found their arrogance to be very annoying and I do not plan on reading anything else published by them. 
 "Lies Across America" is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  Disguised behind this book's apparently innocuous political correctness lies a new form of pernicious censorship.  Even though the author claims that he has no intent to rip down monuments, much of his reasoning is deeply flawed.  Instead of doing original research into the various subjects that he writes on, like a good professor should do, he summarizes a book, says it presents correct conclusions, and then says that the old thinking is wrong.  Case in point, is the chapter on the burning of Columbia, South Carolina during the Civil War.  Instead of looking at all the evidence on what happened when Sherman marched into the city in 1865, Loewen quotes two books which he seems to think draw the correct conclusions, and says that Sherman really had nothing to do with burning the city.  Thus, almost all the historical markers in Columbia are wrong, or so Loewen seems to hold.  Not the most convincing argument.  Loewen goes on to say interesting things in his book but goes absolutely nowhere with them.  For instance, he says that the Confederate Relic Room in Columbia may be "the least accurate museum operated by a state government anywhere in the United States."  Why does he say this?  What evidence does he have to support this other than the museum says that Sherman and his troops burned down 80 % of the city?  Another diatribe against South Carolina is found in the appendix, where Loewen says that John Calhoun has no "redeeming characteristics, so I suggest removing him to museums from Marion Square in Charleston, the South Carolina State House, Calhoun College at Yale, the United States Capitol, and wherever else he sits in a place of honor."  Loewen pretends to be upholding historical realism with quotes from Paul Fussell (a real Historian), but in fact his true agenda is just liberal censorship.    We in America are fortunate that we do not have a strictly homogenous society.  The United States is a society founded by all different types of religions and ethnicities and we should celebrate these differences.  However, just because we disagree with cultures and ideas long ago, that does not mean they are not worth studying.  There are always people that we agree with, and disagree with.  The beautiful thing about open societies like America is that we can read and listen to people that we disagree with, and then make up our own minds.  The great jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote long ago that "the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out."  Censorship, whether propagated by liberals or conservatives, can only stand in the way of this marketplace of ideas.  To say that an important 19th century politician like John Calhoun is not worth studying is just simply intellectually dishonest, especially from a professor.  In conclusion, a book like this should have a place in the marketplace of ideas, but when it comes down to buying into Loewen's theories, I'm glad I checked it out at the library. 
 More than a year, and after severals mails back and forward, I DID NEVER RECEIVE THIS BOOK FROM THE SELLER, in fact I forgoted that until a REVIEW THIS PRODUCT window POP UP in my screen  Still waiting for i 
 This book was recommended to me by an actual SPY!  I found it boring. The characterization of Russians, Israelis, and Arabs were very heavy handed and charicaturish. more precisely, the character of the Hezzbolah Sheik was totally unbelieivable, he seemed to say things that would be impossible to imagine someone in his position saying.. really bad boring stupid book which i threw away a quarter of the way in!  This is absolutley not like early lecarre with his subtle characters and nuanced plots.  Thumbs down 
 The book is about a spoiled unsatisfiable teenage girl whom keeps marrying men and then running away from her problems because she doesn't like her situation. I was forced to reed this book in school and i had no sympathy for the main character Janie. She needs to realize that the world is not perfect. The only part of the book that i actually cared for was at the begining of the book when she is gossiped about upon walking back to town and she ignores the gossip and holds her head high 
 Two moderately decent-looking white people who apparently aren't very good at sex go at it in this movie. If that's your thing, why not just rent a bad softcore porn film and be done with it? At least then you won't have to listen to the cornball pseudo-artistic dialogue in this film. What a crock. They could at least have cast a fine young sista like Rosario Dawson or Gabrielle Union to make this movie moan and squeal! This movie makes sex seem boring 
 A book full of cliches, with little original insight into the composer. Of course, it seems the author's intention really is not to study the composer's life.  The way he renders Beethoven's personal dynamic is bested by three other authors: first, Maynard Solomons' classic BEETHOVEN; then J.W.N. Sullivan's great BEETHOVEN'S SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT; and more recently Carter J. Gregory's historico-fiction, MY ANGEL LEONORA. These are more inspired, but Pearsall is still worth it. Todd Hermanc 
 I'm a big country fan, but it really gets to me when artists 'pontificate' their left OR right leaning political views. Stick to the music guys, and leave the politics to those who are more informed. It's funny how they grab on to the stereotypes perpetuated by the liberal left and just regurgitate it without fact checking at all. Reagan was probably one of our greatest presidents ever, and the left really, really hate that.  The songs aren't bad, but I prefer "the seer" or "the crossing". Check out those instead of this release. Unless you happen to BE a leftist and want to listen to something that further validates your views

 Much like the previous reviewer I urge you not to spend lots of money on HDMI cables. HDMI specs state that only one pixel out of every billion can be lost, therefore there is no reason, no matter what the cable is made of, to spend money on HDMI cables. Search the internet, you can find plenty of good 10ft HDMI cables for $10 or less. Digital is zeroes and ones. In HDMI's case, either the cable is connected or it isn't 
 The wood is very nice - but the design/ manufacturing is very poor.  My experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating.  The holes aren't properly pre-drilled.  The hole at the top didn't match up with the cap-plate hole, which A) made it very difficult to screw together (the first screw stripped) and B) resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly.  I experienced the same issue with shallow pre-drilled holes in the bottom, and the bolts not going in all the way.   I never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions.  Based on the wobbly central column, I decided to disassemble mine and send it back. 
  A history of California, from the founding years through to Gov. Schwarzenegger, was always an ambitious undertaking, one fraught with difficulties, starting with how to approach it. A large, diverse state with a complex history, there are only a few options:  compile an encyclopedia, focus on a few defining events, or create lists.  Unfortunately, Starr takes the last approach, keeping the book to a short 350 pages, but filling those pages with one or two sentences on every event and every major figure in California history.  Unfortunately, while comprehensive, the disjointed style and lack of detail on any topic make for painful reading.  Nearly every paragraph deserves its own book or at least its own chapter. The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 rates 3 paragraphs.    Here's one example taken at semi-random:  "The previous evening, a drunken miner had tried to break into Josefa's cabin, where she was living with her common-law husband, also a Mexican.  Upbraided by Josefa the next day for his conduce, the miner called her a whore.  Enraged, she stabbed him to death."  This was the most interesting passage on the page I opened at random, but it certainly needs to be its own story.  As a novel or movie, this event could succeed in illustrating life during that period in California history, but as half a paragraph, it's just more event in a long list of things that happened.  When Starr turns to arts and literature, the effect is even worse, pages packed with names of artists and writers.  Starr seemed to feel the need to include every writer who ever even visited San Francisco.  Further, parentheticals in nearly every sentence and a reliance on passive voice make the book feel as if it was dictated by a PBS narrator. Though cleared of footnotes and written in large text on small pages to appeal to a general audience, Starr is clearly a historian rather than a writer. Possibly this would have been a more interesting book had it been written by a journalist or novelist rather than an academic, though I expect that a journalist or novelist would realized that this undertaking was impossible and would instead have focused on one particular person or event.  In the end, I felt that I learned more about California history by reading a book focused on a particular theme - for example, Dennis McDougal's Privileged Son, which in the process of telling the history of the LA Times through multiple generations of the founding Chandler family, goes a good job telling the history of Los Angeles itself.  Overall, this book is far too dry to recommend it to someone looking for an overview of California history, and too cursory for anyone looking to learn anything about one particular time or place. 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was not what I expected and I was bored 95% of the time 
 Mainly a series of names and dates.   Difficult to get through - not an interesting writing style 
 Two people recommended Karen Kingsbury to me as an author.  So I checked "Forgiven" out of the library.  I found it hard to finish.  I ended up skimming through the last half.  The dialogue was uninspiring to say the least: "Hey, how are ya?" "Hey, you doing okay?" "think I'll go hang out with so-and so", etc.   There seemed to be too many characters: the only difference in most of them is that some were "Baxters" and some weren't.  I couldn't feel sympathy for any of them because they weren't developed by the author.  She calls Katy "beautiful" but doesn't really describe her.  Peculiarities, mannerisms and personality traits of any of these people are not really fleshed out to enable the reader to connect.  The same applies to the physical settings in which the story takes place.  There is no description of the church where the children practice, or the countryside (except a nature trail when it rained) or anything else that would add a realistic "recognition" dimension to the story. Rather, the author depends on up to date technology,(her characters spend a lot of time flipping open their cell phones, clicking their computer mice, etc.) current buzzwords, movies, plays (like mentioning the musical "Wicked") and world situations to give her story "authenticity".    Katy spent an inordinate amount of time practicing her little play with the children - to the point of yawning repetition..  ( And by the way, I wondered why she felt so "called of God" to do plays like "Annie". Harmless little piece of course, but what's so spiritual about it?)  Then, in the end, the "movie star" goes back to his Hollywood world, even after his life-changing "commitment", and Katy continues her "sacred calling" of directing her little theatre.  I've read too many "Christian" novels like this: with colorless characters, plodding dialogue and contrived situations that are supposed to bring a lump to the reader's throat.  This is just another one of them 
 Ugh. If I ever forget what my own bile tastes like, all I have to do is re-read a few pages of "Eternity Road."  I'm a big speculative fiction fan, and I always give authors the benefit of my suspended disbelief, but Jack McDevitt's imagined "world of tomorrow" just doesn't make sense.  No one remembers anything about the ancient world (i.e. our world), despite the fact that they have a literate, English-speaking society that values ancient artifacts and has trade links to distant lands. Even if all books were destroyed, there'd still be some kind of cultural memory or oral history, don't you think?  Myths and legends about Mighty Abe Lincoln or the 1985 Bears or something?    In short, McDevitt breaks the soon-to-be famous "A.O. Sheepfielder's Two Rules of Speculative Fiction."  Number 1: make your imagined world believable; Number 2: If you can't make your world believable, make it interesting.  The world Jack McDevitt presents us with in "Eternity Road" is neither.  Instead of this time waster, check out "A Canticle for Liebowitz," by Walter M. Miller, "The White Mountains," by John Christopher or, if you're in the mood for something REALLY out there, "Riddley Walker," by Russel Hoban.  You'll be much more entertained, and (to quote Bill Cosby on "Fat Albert"), if you're not careful, you might learn something, too 
 As another reviewer noted, the type in this book is so small that reading is a great effort. And the stories are so depressing that a little goes a long way. The book is quite lovely, but I seldom find myself reading it. I'd recommend buying something else 
 In a factual book I have a high standard for factual accuracy and against propagandizing through adjective excessiveness  This book does not live up to its sub-title.  There is little if anything covered in this book that has not appeared frequently in other books or magazines covering the FBI.  There is a lot of material missing.  For instance the charges of a homosexual relationship with Roy Cohn.  There are far to many cases or instances where Kessler is indicating his approval or disapproval of the bureau and its actions.  There are cases and officers mentioned to the credit of the FBI where that credit belongs to others or the officer in question was not an agent at the time of the event.  Some controversal instances such as Waco are very badly handled. At Waco there are instances of commission in the history.  That Koresh was a religious fanatic with illegal sexual practices is widely published but what those crimes have to do with either the FBI or ATF is an item of controversy.  Investigation by Texas Rangers have shown that ATF lacked probable cause, and through failure to communicate with the sheriff and poor planning turned an investigation into a nightmare.  The FBI's   failure to publish an adequate report after the incident only made things worse in hiding Governmment mishandling of this incident.  Without writing a book of my own I cannot in a small case give all the reasons that I do not intend to share, recommend or inflict this poorly researched and propaganda like book  PeteTestart@Yahoo.co 
 PROS- Quick reference guide with two sample exam and solved solutions  CONS- 1. This is the THIRD printing of this book and it is still chalk full of errors. If you go to the website www.ppi2pass.com to look at the errata they only have it for the first printing so all those errors were alraedy picked up. THE LAST TIME THEY UPDATED THAT WAS IN 2003!!  2. The solutions to the problems are meger at best. Problems are solved out but nothing in depthly. This book is good for a quick reference guide but DO NOT USE IT AS YOUR MAIN STUDY BOOK!  3. THERE IS STILL ERRORS IN A THIRD EDITION 
 Hank Hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of Israel is concerned.  He is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups, to include pretribulationists.  Indeed, his "scholarship" is no scholarship at all; it is pure propaganda....  To see real scholarship, get Tim Cohen's materials (see below):  Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, Zola Levitt, Thomas McCall, John Hagee, Grant Jeffrey, Marlin Maddox, Perry Stone, Texe Marrs, John Walvoord (deceased), etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".

 Overall the recorder worked OK. A moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons. However, that is irrelevant now. A few weeks ago, the unit stop working. I does not turn on at all. What a waist! It is out of warranty now 
 Hank Hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of Israel is concerned.  He is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups, to include pretribulationists.  Indeed, his "scholarship" is no scholarship at all; it is pure propaganda....  To see real scholarship, get Tim Cohen's materials (see below):  Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, Zola Levitt, Thomas McCall, John Hagee, Grant Jeffrey, Marlin Maddox, Perry Stone, Texe Marrs, John Walvoord (deceased), etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?

 This book could quite possibly be the most poorly-written book that I have ever read.  The most glaring flaw is that the last approximately 40 pages are completely irrelevant compared with the rest of the book.  Since the book is only 200 pages long, this is quite a tangent for the author to take.  Within this section, the narrator descends into a self-pitying diary of his early adult years.  I would like to point out that the plot of the book originally centered around his last year of high school.  Past this, the rest of the book suffers from a lack of development.  Many new characters and conflicts are introduced, only to disappear in the next chapter.  The main character never develops, and the reader does not have the ability to empathize with his internal struggles.  The book simply does not have redeeming qualities, and even takes a few moments to trash Ayn Rand; since this is a book that young adults will probably read, it prevents them from forming and informed opinion about that author, controversial as she is.  I was surprised and disappointed that this book was nominated for the Pen/Faulkner award.  I strongly suggest that inquisitive readers look elsewhere for even mediocre reading material. 0 stars 
 I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o 
 I agree with the reviewer below -- Njal's Saga is an amazing piece of work, but Cook's translation is garbage. Track down the Magnusson edition 
 This book managed to come in second in this year's Hugo Award voting. Unfortunately, I don't think it deserved that kind of recognition.   This is another entry in the 'hard' sf sub-genre, one that has as its major point of focus the Vingeian Singularity, which assumes that technological progress is on an exponential slope that will eventually lead to a complete breakdown of civilization as we know it, being replaced by artificial intelligences that will consume all the physical resources of the solar system.   The book is episodic (which follows naturally from its roots as separate short stories), covering three generations of one family as the world moves from pre-Singularity to post-Singularity times. It also leads to the major problem with this book: none of the characters are particularly well-defined or explored in depth. Many of their reactions to the events of this book do not ring true, do not ring human. Of course, Stross may have been trying for exactly that impression - humans of this future world are not the humans of today. While it is interesting in an intellectual way to see how a normal human will morph into something of much greater thinking capacity as he becomes more and more wired up to external computers, and eventually can become a disembodied intelligence, what is lacking here is any emotional basis for believing in these people. The scientific ideas run rampant over the story and characters, and some of those ideas will be difficult for someone not versed in computer-speak to assimilate and understand, leading to some confusion about just what is really happening at various points in the story.   The 'solution' Stross offers to the Fermi paradox (if there are lots of aliens out there, where are they? Why have we seen no evidence of them or had any communications from them?) is plausible, and a lot of the ideas he so casually tosses around are intriguing and stimulating. But without a solid story and strong characters to work within this idea space, the book comes across as more of a scientific treatise than a novel.   --- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat 
 Shocked to find this book in a middle school.  Barely a page goes by without FOUL language.  If this were a talented author, there would be no need for the EXCESSIVE language. It seems to give license to the idea that it's OK for kids to use this kind of language - what a shame 
 I think this book is worse than the others written by Savage-Weiner, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately, most reviewers never bothered reading this book.  On page 2, I am reminded why I hate this guy. Observing "while I'm no military tactician," he forgets to point out he was dodging the draft picking flowers in Hawaii while I and others were serving in Vietnam. He then states, "we still had to fight the real war, a guerrilla war--something our nation does not have the stomach for." Oh, please dude, people like you and your followers don't have the guts to serve. Like on page 10, where he forgets that people like Ted Kennedy at least served in the Navy during WWII. You may disagree with his politics, but at least the Kennedys had the guts to serve.  Skip ahead to page 172 (you ain't missing much) for more of his idiocy on Vietnam. He states, about the Vietnamese, that "in the sixties, no one really knew who they were." Well, he didn't, but 3 million Americans who served in the Vietnam War did. That's what happens when you sit out the war of your generation. He also erroneously claims that Vietnam "was a civil war." At the time of the war it was considered communist aggression. Conservatives of the sixties, like me but not him, knew about the communist threat. This is also the same page where Savage-Weiner claims "Iraq was not a civil war." Where have you been lately?  The "Afterword" really says it all. On page 203 he claims, about liberals, "for far too long you have lived in a cage where liberal ideas--and only liberal ideas--are expressed." He is really talking about himself and his followers. At least liberals, by definition, read and review all points.   For all those who hate "liberals," I would like to remind them that our Founding Fathers were the liberals of their day. A real Patriot of our Revolution (one of my real ancestors in Virginia) would have burned his house down and sent him packing on his big honking yacht.   
 This book is terrible!  There are so many mistakes in this book, I don't even know where to start.  The family tree is so complex, that not even the author seems to have been able to keep it straight.  In addition the plot takes so many twists and turns and so many of them dead end that it is hard work keeping the story straight.  And the ending is predictable.  A character ("Ashely") identified as Odile's grandson on the family tree is called a great-grandson in the text.  The novel describes events that take place in 1999, yet Odile's birthdate is given as 1918, when the characters are supposed to be coming together to celebrate her eighteth birthday.  And when a character talks about an event in the 60's, she describes it as almost thirty years ago?  Last time I checked, that should be almost forty!!! In addition Henry's son is named Harry Jr.  Aren't Henry and Harry different names?  How did he (Harry) get to be a Jr. I couldn't put this book down - mainly because I wanted to see what would be wrong next. These errors bothered me so much, I got up to write a review at midnight - and I've never written a review before 
 As a beginner in technical analysis-based trading, I found Getting Started in Tech. Analysis a good overview of the concepts.  In a well organized format, Schwager clarifies the jargon and confusing chart tools used by the technical analysis trader.  Even skeptics of technical analysis will find some merit in this book, as some of the concepts such as trading ranges and trend lines seem to make sense.  I, myself, have found a few of the tips to be true when analyzing real stock price movements.  To really get a grasp of the material, it's best to read and then reread the chapters several times.  One skeptical argument against this book is that much of the thinking seems to be retrospective.  In the event that the technical analysis indicators prove to be incorrect, the excuse of a "failed signal" is used.  To really test out the theories in this book, one would have to do a great deal of experimental charting and making predictions.  This book also seems to have more examples from the futures markets than stock prices.  I'm not sure if this is because Schwager is an experienced futures trader, or if technical analysis works better in the futures market due to the nature of its extreme price movements.  Finally, unlike a technical trader would like to believe, I am still uncertain whether technical analysis works in today's market.  With today's current events affecting stock prices, it is impossible to make decisions based on price movements alone.  Could technical analysis really work in the current day's trading environment? A market with limited rallies and held back by a fear of international uncertainty?  Perhaps that's up for you, the reader, to decide 
 Tiresome tripe that conflates speculation into bland pronouncements that toe the middle line.  Obviously written more for the sake of tenure, and the latent pro-Indian jingoism is offset by pseudo-moderating sympathy for the European point of view in order to avoid being pigeonholed as a left-wing wacko and thus jeapordizing the bourgeois comforts of an academic career for the life of a vagrant revolutionary.  Reeks of academia and the utter perversion of meaningful intellectual values for the careerism of the self-serving specialist talking tongues to his fellow guild members -DRUNKARDS ALL (too much firewater with bongwater chasers)  That said, the HARDback edition is excellent: bold, cutting, incisive, like eating a York Peppermint Patty while pleasuring ones' self during the upside down parts of a roller coaster ride in a racist theme park!  I have always believed that men should feel commfortable expressing the slightest bit of latent homosexuality in oder to find themselves initiated into homosexual cults, where they will be forced to experiment against their will with physically intrusive explorations of their true feelings.  This book is entirely consistent with that process.  Just look at the jockstrap the guy is wearing on the cover!  A landscape of peace indeed!  More like a Hand scraping a piece....a piece of bootie

 The main thing I learnt from this book is that it is definitely better sometimes to look through a book before buying it. I thought this was a very juvenile book, in terms of the level of smearing and name calling I thought there was, e.g. the False Memory Syndrome Foundation is described as "the CIA's answer to the flat earth society"and Col John Alexander is given the epithet "Doctor of Death". Some child abuse cases are recounted with an unnecessary level of graphic detail, and the author includes a partially obscured picture of a scene of child pornography. I wondered if this was really needed, but then I remembered that the publisher is Feral House, which also publishes books by Satanist Anton LaVey and the Apocalypse Culture books, which also feature child porn. Instead of blaming the CIA for everything, Mr Constantine could also have pointed the finger at his publisher for potentially encouraging Satanism and child abuse.   I don't really want to spend more time saying what I didn't like about this book, but I didn't like the way the author seemed to be so sure of himself. Some examples: all UFOs are manmade, all "alien" abductions are CIA abductions, remote viewing is the CIA beaming images into people's heads.

 I do not recommend you read this book unless you are an academic in the field and need to do so.  Although I am unsympathetic with many of the ideas in it, the primary reason for my low rating is that the book was overlong and poorly written where it matters.  I'll start with what I liked about the book.  The first chapters were on the history of evolutionary theory, and it is here where Gould's principal strength as a popularizer comes through well.  Although these chapters could have been more concise, and they were oriented towards backing Gould's ideas, I enjoyed them for the most part.    The last chapters in the modern theory section on the importance of constraint were interesting, though they suffered heavily from Gould's style of discourse.  I found the last pages of the book on the importance of contingency to be quite beautiful.  The bulk of the book consisted of the material on punctuated equilibrium and Gould's hierarchy of Darwinian individuals.   I had issues with the ideas themselves, but these are a distant second to what I felt about Gould's notion of an argument.    Evolutionary biology is not a branch of philosophy and textual analysis should not, as Gould claims, "be pursued more often in scientific discussion."  They are not done so, according to him, because of the "philistinistic culture of science."  Molecular biology and mathematics are vital components of evolutionary biology, as much and perhaps more so than the incomplete fossil record.  Gould gave lip service to molecular biology and much less respect to the now venerable and important discipline of population genetics - except of course when the results from these fields backed up his narrative.  Gould's use of lawyerly argument, where verdict is truth, is the reason why he is rightfully disdained for opening the door to creation "science" in the debate on teaching evolution in schools.   By stripping away hard science, and replacing it with metaphors, cartoons, and narratives, Gould took a rigorous theory, based firmly on empirical and deductive facts, and replaced it with a secular creation myth that is open to attack.  Although this has made him the darling of what he calls the "literati", it is also what made him a bad scientist.  The fact that he addressed modern Darwinism tangentially, chose instead to focus on Darwin's and others Victorian era writings, and rejected ideas because they didn't "feel right," didn't improve his standing with me.  Gould's writing when it came to the science under debate was a nightmare.  Intentionally or not, he constructed a complex hierarchy of nested, irrelevant tangents; tangents that were fragments within sentences, which were then tangents within paragraphs, which were in turn tangents within sections, ad nauseam.   One of the most frustrating aspects of the book was that he refused to give a clear definition of what he meant by "punctuated equilibrium" until pg 1001: "We locate any revisionary status for punctuated equilibrium in its suggestions about the nature of stasis, and particularly its implications for attributing macroevolutionary phenomena to causes operating on the differential success of species treated as Darwinian individuals.  Ordinary speciation remains fully adequate to explain the causes and phenomenology of punctuation."  Others, such as Richard Dawkins, have done much on addressing this definition of punctuated equilibrium.  My comment here is that it took so long to come to it, and up until this point Gould hinted at saltationist underpinnings to punctuated equilibrium, only to later decry and impugn the integrity of his critics for criticizing these alternative definitions.    My main intellectual criticism was of Gould's hierarchy of Darwinian individuals.  I thought this was fine as a phenomenological tool to describe macroevolutionary events, but Gould inverted cause and phenomena to claim that species selection is irreducible to gene or organism selection.  His reason why?  "Nonlinearities."  Along with not knowing what the word "fractal" means, which he used quite a bit to mean either "self-similar" or "scales up", Gould thought "nonlinear" meant "hopelessly complex."  His style of argument?  Keep repeating the word irreducible until the reader breaks down.  Gould was snidely dismissive towards the results of population genetics, but only addressed them directly in a (relatively) brief two page discussion where he claimed that they had to be invalid because population genetics models were able to explain both punctuated equilibrium (stasis followed by rapid change) and his cartoon notion of Victorian gradualism.  Since Gould himself was clear that both are evident in the fossil record, it is strength, not a weakness, of a modeling system to be able to explain both.        Although the ideas in the book did not all resonate with me, I would have recommended it if it was more clear and much, much more concise, since the ideas in it are an important part of the current discussion on evolutionary theory.  But because of the poor writing in the important scientific parts of the book, and Gould's often unprofessional comments towards critics, I don't think this behemoth of a tome is worth your time.  
 I love George Gershwin tunes.   But, after listening to the first cut on disk one entitled "Prelude No.2 For Piano," my first thought was:  "You've got to be kidding, couldn't the engineers have reduced the "hiss" noise from this great collection."   Unfortunately, the problem was with my equipment. Once corrected, this CD was well worth the money spent. My vote goes from two stars to Five Stars 
 The shortcomings of Doniger's general Indological scholarship have been detailed by Michael Witzel and Rajiv Malhotra. This book suffers from the same flaws. The translations are idiosyncratic, and she is obsessed with finding sex, even in situations that none is called for 
 I don't own this gear bag, and I'm not going to buy it even though it looks interesting.  Would this be a suitable carry-on bag, or would I have to check it?  I don't know.  The dimensions are not given anywhere.  I want to know more about the products I order 
 I read this book on the advice of a review in the science journal, Nature.  But I must say that it is, at best, a monotonous, plot-free read. There is virtually no history of science here, no gripping detective story or expose, and it is certainly far from engrossing.  There are no personalities involved, little sensitivity to history, and so nothing to grab one's interest.  Except for the first chapter (concerning a law suit over a stolen copy), the rest of the book pretty much consists of a dry, bare-boned littany of the author's survey of extant copies of Copernicus' great treatise, De Revolutionibus.  There are a few entertaining comments about Edward Rosen (another historian of science fascinated with Copernican minutiae )that smack of professional rivalry (or perhaps a generational shift in science history studies?).  The rest of the chapters consist of lifeless prose on boring topics, with an rambling commentary on the then-current Cold War.  The book is tedious because it fails to breathe life into its topic.  But then, how could it? For it is little more than a glorified list of copies.  It took nearly all my gumption (not to mention a looong layover in Chicago O'Hare Airport) to even finish the book.  Stick to the highlights (Chapters 1-3, Plate 1a, and the photo on p. 198 of Galileo's horoscope for Cosmo d'Medici) and you'll have about all there is worth having here. 
 I bought a pair in January and loved them. Sound is as lovely as everyone describes. However, there are something seriously lacking in the build quality. The soft wires felt flimsy to me when I first opened it, but I thought I'd just take extra care.   At 1 month of careful usage, the plastic-covered wires from earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened that I could almost use them as chopsticks, and makes it so the earbuds popped out at the slightest motion. At 2 months of careful usage, the wires had half-ripped from the plug--which I repaired the best I could with unsightly electrical tape. However, at 3rd month, the left bud fell completely off.   I am very disappointed--it is one of the best-sounding phones I've ever had (I've owned both Grado s60 and s90, and sennheisers), but man, they need to do something about making this baby last 
 The scandals themselves were interesting however I found the book hard to read.  Some of the information was repetitive from chapter to chapter and it was not well written.  I was looking for something that I could just pick up an read a story at a time and this was not the book for that 
 I started out a huge fan of this series.  Many fans of LKH left or became disgusted with the turn this series took after Narcissus in Chains, but this one was the straw that broke this camel's back.  Where there was once a dynamic plotline rife with action, drama, diverse and interesting characters......it became an ill-conceived series of pointless sex, zero plot, and disappearing personalities.  I, as of yet, have not picked up the latest book and don't plan to based on what I've heard of it.  I'm personally relying on a friend of mine that has stuck with the series to let me know when it's safe to pick up another one of these books because I refuse to do so on my own.  As of yet, she has told me not to bother.  How anyone who claims to be a fan of this series can say that the latest 3 books are even nearly on par with the rest is beyond me 
 Early on the author tells how he proved to concept of "learned helplessness" through his experiments where he administered electric shocks on caged dogs until they gave up and just lay there and whimpered.  I threw the book away at that point.  This "scientist" shouldn't be rewarded for his senseless cruelty that proves nothing.  We don't support your science, Herr Doctor Seligman!  Get the book from a library if you must, but don't reward him for his "experiments."  It could have been your dog this moral idiot experimented on 
 About 1st book: Taira Shinken is a well know name in Okinawan Kobudo. His "RyuKyu Kobudo Taikan" stands as a reference on Okinawan Kobudo technique not polluted by modern fashion which is almost always the result of plain ignorance and show-business. Mr. McCarthy issued this english version of the old master work apparently for the benefit of non-japanese practitioners.  However there are some issues: 1 - He boldly replaced all the pictures of sensei Taira Shinken for pictures of himself and one of his pairs. Some pictures, mainly the in kon-bo katas show some irregular handling of the weapon (with hands too close to each other) and some indefinite stances which can puzzle some inexperienced practicioners. 2 - He didn't respect the original material. Every kata in Shinken Taira original work has been somewhat changed! Techniques were added, omited or replaced in all katas! An entire sequence is different in Shushi-no-Kon.  Old katas were made as a global repository of knowledge by old masters in a age of practical life-threatening fighting. The knowledge they contain is unique and irreplaceable. Modern fancy-athletic-acrobatic pseudo-kata cannot compare and never will! These katas can have some school or local variations which should be respected and considered when looking for a "reference" form. Each new generation should try to respect the old forms keeping in mind that there is no way of reliably testing and improving them in life-threatening situations nowadays as they once were.  Works such as "Ryukyu Kobudo Taikan" should not be altered: they are a personal testimony of a great master and document uniquely an entire epoch and a long martial tradition.  I advise everyone interested seriously in Okinawan Kobudo to buy the recently re-issued japanese version of Taira Shinken work featuring the original (yes! They are still usable!) illustrations (along with Mr. McCarthy's "interpretation" if one doesn't read japanese) in order to get the correct knowledge.  About 2nd book: The 2nd book of the series is a repository of reference historical documents about traditional Karate featuring precious info about old karate masters and the true spirit of Karate. It's mostly text-based with only 10 b/w pictures but has a lot of "juice" in it. It should find a prominent place in the library of the serious karateka. 
 Roger Scruton, like many so-called "conservatives" has made a noble swing (hence the two stars) at assessing the spiritual and philosophical problems of our day that have produced what Eliot called the "hollow men", but his "conservative" view is not mine.  While he doesn't give a cultural solution, he makes the keen observation that all conservatives can agree upon, by and large, in the first paragraph of p. 82 regarding culture and religion, how the two intersect, and how one derives meaning. Well done there.  He observes how artists have become the new priests, but have turned art into kitsch, (p. 90) and religion followed (p. 92). In this chapter (8), he correctly discusses how the first effects of modernism was to make high-culture difficult, rather than broadly affirming, which was true - hyper elitist, which you can read from works in T.S. Eliot's day and before. Furthermore, culture became kitschy and ultimately banal, via pop culture, ultimately imbuing fake aesthetic values, which I concur with the author's observation. In Anglo culture, pop culture has become, by and large, fake heritage - a commercial phony disguising what has been lost.  In Chapter 10, he makes some apt observations about the totemic iconic status of pop stars. While pop stars have saint-like status, particularly with youth, I think Scruton gives them too much validity, though they are the modern bards, I wish he would have seasoned his thoughts with an analysis on how corporate ownership uses this enculturation to manipulate the public into the reductionistic location of commodity - everything for sale.  Although, I agree with much of Michael Gunther's assessment regarding Scruton's book of meditations, or rather, observations, that is taking a critical observation of the time line from the Reformation, which Scruton calls the Enlightenment (an historical error).  The error that he makes is to pin, like many conservative Roman Catholic thinkers, the problems of Western society onto the Protestant Reformers, particularly Martin Luther, which is the tone on pages 19, 81 and elsewhere, but explicitly on page 23. He attempts to infuse the Reformation with the caustic thoughts of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche and others. This is an inaccurate analysis of Western religion and thought. While he introduces some continental thought that is less known today, like earlier German and French literature and art, he tends to merge it all eclectically to seek a salve for his tortured cultural mind. His solution, like many of his ilk, is to decry the breaking up of the Roman Catholic hegemony in the Middle Ages and the retreat of its sacred vision and authority.   But, the fact of history is that the building and erosion of Western culture is a multi-faceted one that is not so convenient to his position. For instance, did you know that Charles V, who was at odds with the Reformation, also sacked Rome and the pope?  While conservative myself, an Anglo "Whig" conservative, I read this book and saw more broadly how the contemporary "liberal" / "conservative" divide is really a loosely held confederation of worldviews, with many overlaps. Scruton is really trying to speak from an English cultural view (we'll say Anglo, because that cultural worldview reaches beyond England). The conservative Anglo worldview changed in the time of the Tudors to a Reformed Protestant one (even that morphed between a traditional Anglican, Puritan Anglican / Non-Conformist, Laudian, Latitudinarian, Evangelical and others). Like ancient Israel, even this has its muddling. In religious history, the rise of the Anglo-Catholic movement undermined and co-opted this history, which made it vulnerable, as Newman would observe of its romantic medievalism. In history, Britain and the Anglo world started to lose its history and memory as it grew out, losing its religion, and getting caught up in colonial concerns that gained the world, but lost its soul; which got it entangled with multi-culturalism, which has become its political warder. The story is too long and interwoven to call it all out, but there are milestones and I think Scruton gets it wrong from the Anglo position. To make it universal is more difficult, which is what many are trying to do today without ties to religious mooring, but through political revisionisms, such as the post-modern views that Scruton aptly scrutinizes.   Much of the post-War angst you can read in such works as the writings of Philip Larkin and the critiques of Peter Hitchens, and I must add, George Orwell; and, in film and TV (e.g. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy", "Inspector Morse", etc.). This undertow was revealed much earlier in Matthew Arnold's era, like his poem, "Dover Beach". WWI, positivism, socialism, among other elements, helped push it along (the 60s wasn't the origin, it was a cumulative effect). The result has been a tragic ride down a nihilistic path. For those in Britain, the punk movement makes cultural sense as an outcome, but even it too has been submerged into the sale and dance of commodity culture, which is what we have with the loss of tradition. You can now see why human life is devalued and cruelty is the face of pop culture today - but you won't see that in the papers or in advertisements without looking.  Lastly, Scruton makes some keen observations about the Zeitgeist influenced by the usual suspects, like Herbert Marcuse, Jean-Paul Sartre, Michael Foucalt and others who exported much of their nihilistic poison, which he correctly ties in with the 18th century Jacobins and moving forward (p. 124f). None the less, the soixante-huitards have had their day. But for Scruton, he odes cultural hope without faith and strangely Confucius and not Christ? A truly orthodox Protestant critique, which would have also resonated in the ancient Jewish / Catholic / Orthodox heart - is to trust God and not institutions, which man tends to deify in substitution, which happened at Trent and elsewhere.  Our times are much like the days in the book of Judges. If one looks at Christian and Western history through the glass of the ancient history of the Old Testament Jews, one will get a better look at a truly conservative vision of the history of man (Anglo and otherwise) and God and some light toward a clearer interpretation of man's history - a story of man, with feet of clay, troding back and forth like Bunyan's allegory trying to find himself and his way.  
 This book is a bit of a disappointment. Although the second half of the book is a photographic section of launch vehicles and has some illustrative value, the first part, which should have been a technical description with illustrations/drawings is incomplete as many launch vehicles are not covered (focus is on U.S. manned launch vehicles mainly- and the shuttle is not described). I guess there is too much information that needs to be included but not enough space in a 100-page booklet. A Launch Vehicles space guide should have come in a two-set package or in a larger book 
 Unlike other reviewers I cannot praise this book.  It has its moments - passages of writing that let us enter the mind of an artist - but most of it I found tedious. Being just about believable the main character is easily the best of a thin an unconvincing bunch. The novel hasn't aged well and the story line is silly and not very interesting. The humour escaped me. I haven't read the other parts of the trilogy and nothing about this book encourages me do so 
 Unfortunately the version of JSF this was written against was using a different naming standard for the taglibs and there are a few other concepts that have changed.  Wish I would've bought a different book 
 This is a poet who has no emotional or spiritual depth. He is poet of shame. His sarcasm and wit is anything but remarkable. I was actually looking foward to reading his poetry in my class, but was terribly disappointed. It's not worth it. 
 This book made me feel dirty as a womyn. I found it insensitive, uninspired, and inaccurate. Anyone who wants true scholarship should look elsewhere for truth. There were, of course, many Goddesses in herstory,  however to deny them their individual importance with a pseudo-intellectual  monotheistic interpretation makes us no better than the men we must  educate. It is time for synchronism, not separatism 
 After loving all the "Dibley" series and specials and even traveling to Turville, where they filmed the exteriors for the series, I eagerly awaited the new specials.  I thought it would be wonderful to see the whole gang reunited, but all I felt was a massive wave of disappointment.    The characters are more chariactures and do not act as they should:  I'm sorry, but Geraldine sticking her whole HEAD into a chocolate fountain?  Not something she would do.  The cup of chocolate, yes.  The "baptism by Cadbury"?  Not her at all.  Alice and Hugo offering a threesome to Geraldine?  Nuh-uh.  Nope.  No way.  Buy these ONLY if you're a die-hard fan, like me.  As it is, however, I doubt I'll be watching these again unless the rest of my "Dibley"s get destroyed.  I'm sad that Richard Curtis sank so low 
 A bit disappointing, in that it was supposed  to be of the same vain as 'The Matrix'. Cir- cuitry Man, with Vernon Wells, filmed in 1989  and released in 1990, beat this type of Sci-Fi  film to the punch. C.M./P.R:C.M. II does much more with less - as in less budget. Reeves should have instead done 'Point Break II'!! 
 This book is very simple. Large text and pictures. Its easy reading and I was able to whip through the book pretty quickly 
 If I had known that this SACD was only a 2 channel SACD, I would not have even bothered.   Playing the original CD in all channel mode sounds better than this pile.   Man, after listening to (my only other SACDs, so far) Joe Satriani's Strange Beautiful Music, and the 30 year anniversary hybrid SACD of Dark Side of the Moon, (both amazing in 6 channel SACD) this was a huge letdown.  I like the album a lot, and am a big fan of The Police, but if you already have the original CD, THERE IS NO REASON to buy this thing, the better sampling rate doesn't help it a bit (get it?... hehehe).   Call The Police, I've been ripped-off.   !!!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! 
 Hmm I wonder if those giving this book five stars actually work for McKinsey.  As a practioner, I don't know anyone in the industry who has actually read this book.  It looks impressive on the bookshelf, but the content is anything but impressive.  A lot of topics are covered, but each one only superficially and the writing is extremely dry and boring.  I actually found reading this volume *painful*, and I'm supposed to like this stuff since I do it for a living!  My advice for any potential buyer is read a few chapters first before you shell out for it 
 The advice in this book may be good for someone who is suffering from workaholism.  For most people this book is worthless.  Indulgence in pleasure only brings temporary gradification and an endless want for more pleasure.  The book is irritating to read as author comes across as a self absorbed braggart who manufactures tall tales.  He divorced his wife to marry a much younger woman.  The author stopped going to clairvoyants because they always predicted what girl he would meet and what house he would buy and so life became boring.  Sounds like bragging fiction to me.  Selfishness & self indulgence bring suffering not happiness.  The last thing people need is more encouragement toward self indulgence.  Unfortunately seems to me that many therapists seem to encourage selfishness because it is what clients want to hear.  Ever notice that people who have been in therapy for a long time are so self-absorbed as to be impossible to be with?   The real path to happiness is to divorce selfishness not your wife and to serve others.  Much better books: read Pathways to Joy by Vivekananda or any book by the Dalai Lama or books by Ken Wilber.   
 Blue Racer: Say bug, who cares about The Bay City Rollers. Japanese Beetle: Apparently America didn't as music like Led Zeppelin, Queen, Pink Floyd and The Eagles was huge(and still looked back in great terms on) unlike these freaks Serpent Son. Blue Racer: SATURDAY NIIIGGGGGHHHT was F*CK*NG G******YYY! Japanese Beetle: You got that right, avoid or HAASAH! SAYONARA! 
 the book is superficial and has the same plot in the beginning as MAD  JACK, another of her book 
 When I used the Nature Spirit spell in the book all sorts of bad things started happening to me afterwards and I felt the presence of evil in my house. I ended up moving because I knew everytime I went home evil was waiting for me. Don't mess with this stuff! The book sounds good but it unleashes bad spirits 
 I didn't notice any change in the operation of my cd writer after cleaning.  The cleaner was supposed to play music while it cleaned (30 minutes)  It didn't 
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 I find it highly unlikely anyone allegedly getting these old Hollywood stories from Lucille Ball herself would have gotten them so inaccurately.  Approximately two chapters into the book, I began to strongly suspect this man never knew Ms. Ball at all.  He supports their "intimate friendship" with an insert of photographs, all of which were obviously taken on only two different occasions, my guess is they were taken right before she had him arrested for stalking.  Passing up no opportunity to toot his own off-key horn, the author tends to paint Ms. Ball as a bitter old clown who apparently hated everyone in the world except Jim Brochu, wildly incongruent with virtually every other existing account of Lucille as a generally warm and generous soul who was well loved by those who knew her. Brady's "Lucille", Andrew's "Lucy & Ricky & Fred & Ethel" and Ms. Ball's own "Love Lucy" are only three of a number of infinitely better, more entertaining, and more accurate books on this subject that I can think of without even looking it up.   This book is total garbage, it should be read only to placate the author's obvious need to display his psychosis to the rest of the world, and then kept on hand in case the reader should run out of loo paper one day.  
 If you are serious about learning Japanese then don't buy this book. All of the pronunciations of the Kanji are written using romanj, which is an unnecessary crutch and will only lead to problems later on. If you really want to learn Japanese then do yourself a favor and learn the Hiragana and Katakana. Honestly it is much easier than it looks and will pay off in the long run. 
 I love to read plays and performed in many. I was so curious about this play-the book was in excellent condition-got it in time. No complaints there. I read the play and thought it was the worst play. IT's not "cutting edge" just dark and morbid. I know we want to go beyond the line but this was just dumb. I would never direct this play and I am directing in Chicago..but to each is own-if you liked it that's what makes the world go round..enjo 
 Having invested heavily in a single stock - WorldComm - Paulos laments his financial loss, and embarks to write a book where he takes the reader through a spectrum of equities analysis methodologies, and disproves their apparent success as attributes of illusions and perceptions. Through the use of thought experiments, he attempts to re-wire the readers to comprehend the true nature of randomness, which is more ordered than most people's expectations.   The good stuff aside, I am very disappointed with the book for two reasons. Firstly, the publisher's marketing of the book is highly misleading. It hints that the author used his professional skills as a mathematician to beat the market. As such I bought the book hoping to understand why the author failed, and hope to avoid his pitfalls. Instead, the author did not have any first hand experience with any of the techniques discussed. He simply did not apply any mathematical methods, or any method for that matter, during his compulsive purchase of WorldComm shares. So anyone hoping for case studies would be let down.   Secondly, Paulos' arguments are not all that convincing. While he successfully presents an alternative hypothesis based on the incorrect human perceptions of probability, he makes no attempts to disprove established theories. All he has achieved is simply to offer another explanation. The section on technical analysis is particularly poor, as his arguments were rather superficial, and amounted to simply saying technical analysts have not provided convincing prove - he does not feel he needs to go any further. What is confusing to me, is that he rejects technical analysis despite giving a marvellous introduction, and goes on to explain how and why technical patterns form, as well as admitting throughout the book that the psychology of the market is what moves prices - one of several core principles of technical analysis.   Having said all that, "A Mathematician Plays the Market" is an eye-opener in lateral thinking for the non-mathematically inclined, and is a recommended read for financial novices. Professionals in either fields can give this book a miss 
 Unless you are old enough to remember seeing these guys perform live...as I did.....you probably wont be impressed with the quality of the recordings or the musicianship...these guys are "garage band" at best...They were ok in concert....just your average garage band who had a hit record...  The hit "Pushin too hard"...is the high point of the cd....the rest of stuff is mere filler....Back then...same as now...there was a reason why bands like this never achieved superstar status...they lack that magical charisma to lock you in. 
 This director mistakes lame attempts at surrealism for art. Artsy-fartsy disjointed and meaningless scenes leave the viewer benumbed and wondering what this movie is about.  Speaking Russian is no help in discovering the point of this wan effort. 
 It seemed like this book could have been written in a matter of 50 pages.  Long story short: Cramer's wife taught him what he knows, and bailed him out when he didn't have a clue in 1998.  This guy is a journalist and a marketer, not a great trader 
 Would be a great product if it was a couple of inches larger in both dimensions.  It's not big enough for an adult cat to stand on while scratching, which is essential for them to not have it kick-out while using it vigorously. I have a larger one from another manufacturer which my cats love, so it's a great concept.  This one is just too small 
 I've read most of Chuck Palahniuk's earlier work and have always enjoyed his stories. His characters are intriguing, his prose is uniquely readable, and his insights into modern American culture are simple but effective. This book, however, was a real disappointment. I put it down halfway through because I couldn't take it anymore - and I almost never stop reading a book before I've finished it.   As other reviewers have noted, the short stories that make up half the book are actually pretty good reads in and of themselves. Grotesque, perhaps, but nothing so bad as to overwhelm the author's intent of delving into the various characters' psychology. The overacrching story that ties them together is a different matter. It starts off interestingly enough, but it quickly turns into self-parody and descends from there, becoming repetitive and ultimately unreadable.   Without the short stories interspersed, this book wouldn't be worth a second glance. If you're interested in reading Palahniuk for the first time, you'd be better served by Survivor, Fight Club, or Lullaby. If you're already a fan, pass on this and wait for the next...or go re-read your old favorites 
 Unlike Cussler's other series, I found this first story of the "Oregon Files" slow going at first and rather confusing. There are just too many things going on (no problem, I suppose, for multi-taskers!) and way too many characters to keep track of. Also, there's little to no character development even of "Mr. Chairman", Juan Cabrillo. The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries (with a penchant for good deeds that pay well) doesn't compare favorably with the NUMA heroes. However, the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides I expect from Mr. Cussler and co-writers. I look forward to the subsequent Oregon Files with high hopes.  
 Complete waste of money!  I bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it!  After several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed.  Now the darn thing does not respond to her answers.  Even when I clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register.  Complete waste of Money!!!!  Would not recommend to anyone!  Save your money and play with a rock, much more fun 
 The new version of this book is now being sold under a different title: "The Corporate Records Handbook". Don't buy this old version 
 I continue to marvel at "men" like James Dobson who blatantly ignores all the solid statistical evidence that children brought up with love and without violence function better in life.  Dobson is also an anti-porn crusader, and he also ignores the fact that anywhere porn has been legalized, rape statistics have dropped dramatically. (Source: the book 'Porn 101' 
 Whatever happened to "You can't map a sense of humor" ?? 
 I am in no way unaccustomed to classical literature and have read many a book which, though the language, being non-contemporary, has been difficult yet immensely rewarding.  Heart of Darkness is however no such book.    Conrad cannot help himself but to create sentences which are comprised 90% of adjectives.  I must agree with Ryen Lapham's review - the content of the book is worthy of a short story alone - some 30 pages, but is stretched out over 100 and feels three times the size.  I was positively exhausted after reading this book.  The feeling was one of listening to someone with a strong accent whom I struggled to understand.  I found the constant streams of adjectives and lack of content placed me in a state of meditation and I often had to reread pages again and again because my mind was constantly wandering off.  Even then, on many occasion, I struggled to understand what was going on.    Conrad constantly jumps topics and within a few words he has moved from confronting Kurtz in the jungle to chugging off in his steam boat.  It is totally confusing - who is in the steam boat - where are all the natives - where is Kurtz (two words ago Conrad had mentioned him in his cabin).  The book is similar throughout.  Though he does challange many of the myths of Imprerialism of his time his view of the 'savages' is amazingly patronising and his constant referral to them as cannibals is not only wholly incorrect but insulting.  I felt at times Conrad's view of the blacks wasn't far off the derogatory views of those that he is attacking.  I must admit, after rushing to finish this novel (for the wrong reasons) my last words are too - "The horror! The horror!" 
 I saw this book at a friend's shortly after seeing the movie.  I asked her if I could borrow it.  She said I wouldn't want to.  She'd been trying to read it for awhile, and didn't like it.  I decided to try anyway.  Unfortunately, my friend was right.  This is a definite case of a movie being much better than a book.  I really liked the movie.  However, the book is too long and boring.  There are so many tangents in it that have nothing to do with the central story.  I can't believe I even finished it.  Rent the movie-don't waste your time on the book 
 My issue isn't so much with this physical book itself - the pictures are big and colorful, although often blurry for some reason - as much as it is with the architecture. Palladian windows and columns are classical elements, and building with brick and stone are classical materials, but architecture is all proportion. With the exception of the Julian Bicknell work, this book is largely haphazard attempts at making new buildings look old by throwing a lot of money at them. What is missing is the understanding of proportion - not just in the Palladian sense - but in the sense of the early 20th century American architects - Lindeberg, Delano & Aldrich, Trumbauer, Mellor, Meigs & Howe, Pope, Platt, and later Adler, etc. And you can throw Lutyens in the U.K. in there as well. Anyway, I guess I would say - you're not likely to learn much from this book, and that if you are interested in the houses that inspired this "new" Classicism, just stick with the aforementioned work 
 By arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of "dignity" and "familiarity" rather than sentience and feeling, Fukuyama brings to mind the European colonists who considered Africans no more than "common beasts." His philosophy, although argued in a tone that seems reasonable, is at turns startingly narrow-minded and genetically-racist. Not reccomended: readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics 
 This book was an attempt to make money off of someone who has adoring fans.  This book had little if no input from Eminem himself.  I just recently bought HIS book, Angry Blonde.  If you want the truth from the guy himself, buy that book instead 
 This book completely ignores the most important nonzero sums of a human male's life which are the amount of women a male mates with and the amount of children a male sires. Ignoring these two sums makes the theory Wright proposes collapse. 
 To each his own, and it seems that this book is well liked by several readers, but it didn't strike me as a five or even four-star read.  It's well written in a way, but maybe it's the fact that it's fairy tales being eroticized that makes it strange.  To me, anyway.  Fairy tales are odd enough without sex.  But I think I could have gotten over that, except for the fact that maybe two or three of these stories seemed to be really imaginative and truly erotic.  The rest were kind of dully repetitive, and/or just silly.  I don't know exactly how to express it -- perhaps, that they read more like someone practicing how to write erotica?  Also, these stories were almost all written from a woman's POV, which is limiting.  Two stories, THE GOOSE GIRL and one other whose title I can't recall, incorporated a man's POV too, which made them better than average.  I'm returning my copy to the store I purchased it from.    
 I can only write about my few years with her - but I certainly have more insight about the woman not so much the singer than this whole dumb book.  Lots about recording - of course he was not there - and nothing about her other than "and then she did".. 
 I would have given this one star, but watching the one girl who can't do any of the exercises is pretty funny.  She's completely inept, and I don't know how she got chosen.  I guess she was willing to be filmed nude, so that was good enough.  Otherwise, this video is (poor).  The lighting is horrible and the camera angles are bad.  Very amateurish.  Definitely recommend Totally Nude Aerobics over this one.  That video is much higher quality, has better looking women, and they all can do the exercises.  The only problem (well, only a problem depending on how you look at it) with that one is that there are a lot of close-ups and no instruction, so if you're actually looking for an aerobics tape, you'll be out of luck.  But I don't think the main audience is actually looking for an exercise video 
 You charge too much for shipping and handling. I would have been better off going to a Retail Store 
 I really like Thomas Moore's books but this one was definitely not one of his best. I found it very boring and it was kinda one of those books that just made no sense at all. I found it hard to continue to read the whole book even tho I did... 
 Let me start by saying I'm a big Pam Grier fan but this movie was one of her worse efforts. I don't know if it was just the particular disc I have but the sound was awful. I had to turn up the sound to a rediculous volume level just to barely hear it. Typical of "Blaxplotation" films the plot was weak, the violence gratuitous and the villians one dimentional. Our heroine looked good as usual but if you're looking for skin this isn't your film.  
 Most of the moves go too quickly, does not give your muscles are full workout. If you want to remember the moves and work it on your own that's fine. But then again why don't you just buy a book and do it yourself?   The "sculpting stick" which does not include with the video, is not particularly useful to the type of workout suggested. With or without do the same.   Also, the three 12 mins workouts was too short to make the video worth its price. I'm sure there are plenty of workout videos out there with better pacing for a full workout on your muscles and longer selection recorded. For example, I tried Tamilee Webb's Abs, Arms and Legs of Steel, that is much better I think 
 Film lovers know this movie is no more than the Hollywood version of the awarded Argentinan film "Hombre mirando al sudeste" (Man facing southeast) of 1986. The difference however, is that the latter is way more profound and philosophic. For those interested, I highly recommend the Argentinan film, although it is very difficut to get outside Latin America, especially with english subtitles. 
 PLease consider how many books there are out there before you pick up THIS one.  Though you may be a fan of suspense or romance, this has a plot that has managed to be predictable, dull, and pretentious all at once.  The story is a basic spy story, and the little romance is obscured by slang which has no place in today's literature.  The author tends to describe things in a way that could take paragraphs (if not pages) to explain.  The only reason to go near this book is for a school project or in class assignment.  Otherwise, ther is no reason to read through this "classic".  
 There is so much scientific nonsense in the book that it is appalling! Working in the field of self-organized behavior in insects colonies, I can tell you that the presentation of that subject in the book is awful!  The number of wrong statement is so outrageously large that they are impossible to list below 10 pages of text!! It is a pity because such a book completely discredits a real scientific field that is confronted enough with new-age babble, scientific unfounded or wrong statements, pseudo-philosophical stupidities and so on. If you want to learn something real about "emergence" please stay away from this book. The rating of 1 star is just for the paper on which the book is written.. 
 I love cheesey horror films from the late 60's/early/70's. With that being said I was very dissapointed watching this movie. It's bad. Not bad in a good cheesey way, but bad as in almost impossible to watch. Here are my reasons why:  -The music. My god, I have never heard such wrong music for a movie. When I see people getting killed I know that I want to hear soft James Taylor type music. It added nothing to the atmosphere of the film, and in fact hurt it.  -The editing. I have never seen such bad editing. One moment one of the victims is across a large creek from her attacker, and the next the attacker is on the same side chasing her again. I could go on, but there are so many editing goofs that I would be here all night describing them.  -The screenplay. The situation itself could have been believable if the dialogue , and scenes, had been better written. As it is the entire situation seemed really unbelievable. It makes me wonder how this film ever got made.  -The acting. None of the story was believable because the acting was so awful. As I said before I love cheesey movies. Sometimes that includes bad acting, but when it is combines with the above stated faults it makes it a horrible thing to witness.  The reviewer who said that this is an important horror film has got to be kidding me. Hammer horror films from the same era are important. AP horror films from this era are important. This film? It should be forgotten and avoided at all costs. I knew that there was a reason why I have never liked Wes Craven's movies 
 Maybe at the time it was written I would have reviewed it more favorably. In light of the life Miller led I can't help but to be disappointed by the cheap commericialization of the socialist superiority over capitalist theme that permeates the play. Here Miller creates a character only to destroy that character to point out the ills of capitalism, then Miller spends the rest of his life living an indulgent capitalist life here in the good ole USA: the very capitalist society that was supposedly Willy's oppressor. I think the years have taken the shine off of Miller a bit. I'm sure the Liberal 101 literature professor will disagree 
 I bought this book out of curiosity rather than as a teaching guide as I already play the piano to grade 8 (ABRSM).  I wish I had not bothered and kept my 14.99. The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons. The incessant attempt at humour is offputting from the start and the content is disjointed and lacks any conceptual ideas of what music and the piano is really about.  The CD accompanying the book is a joke, and if this is an example of the author's musical skill I shudder to think what else he has produced. The irritating keyboard rhythms and styles are a throw back to the Bontempi school of music.  IMO  this book is pants and is not worthy to carry the name Piano in its title. Save your money and don't buy it, there are lots of other very good "easy books" on teaching beginners the piano 
 Package missing.  It's never be received.  So I cannot rate it 
 Sigh...  Like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's sheet music, selections from Phantom of the Opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts.  Even worse, the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all, rather it simply follows the vocal line.  This might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist, but for a real musical theater fan, it's very disappointing.  So far, I've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment (an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score).  The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Soprano, Vol. 3, compiled by Richard Walters features "Think of Me" and "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" in their original form.  For performers and accompanists alike, there's something to get excited about.  So far, we're still waiting on more from the Phantom of the Opera, but they're creating a 4th edition of the Anthologies soon, so watch out 
 Never received the book, so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost I have incurred 
 I believe Ayn Rand's writings are very destructive. And this isn't because of her highly un-original philosophy. No, the reason for this is the powerful grip the books has on her followers. In her books they find  justification for behaving in a anti-social manner that is slowly  destroying the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is  supposedly derived from "reason". In the real world however there  is no reason for people not to find fulfillment and meaning from helping  others and caring for their family and friends. The accusation that  "altruism", i.e. decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is  nothing but products of a very paranoid mind. The craziest thing about this  though is the fact that Ayn Rand has been raised to a saint-like status by  her followers. No disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if  you disagree you are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true  individualist you must agree with everything she has ever written. Isn't  this collectivism in a true sense? No, says her followers, those views are  derived by reason and must therefore be share by all intelligent human  beings. Pretty scary!! Note that Objectivism, like Marxism, Freudianism and  Jungianism, is a closed system of thought in the sense that any critisism  of the system is automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what  makes Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific method.  And this is also the reason for the fanatical behavior of her disciples 
 The concept is nice ... 802.11g camera.  However there are some fundamental flaws with the design.  The streaming of the video is too heavy-weight for the 802.11g.  A simple ping shows hops in excess of 800ms.  As soon as I stop streaming, it is about 16ms ... which means the cams processor is overloaded.    The stream is very choppy.  As for pan / tilt ... only works 25% of the time.  The video always streams (which means there is connectivity), but when I issue pan/tilt commands, only 25% of the time does it respond to my commands.  I bought this as a toy ... to put in the front window to see who is there, while I am working in my home office.  I don't see how someone would / could use this for practical monitoring.  The picture is very choppy, not very clear, and doesn't respond to commands.  Considering Linksys is owned by Cisco ... this hit the market without any real quality assurance.  This is hardly useable.  2 thumbs down.  Come'on Cisco ... get your act together.  You are leaving room for someone to come in and do it better.  I will be returning this, and may buy the panasonic 
 Don't buy this.  It is not worth the price.  Poor recording. 
 I used to love SB novels, but the last few have been so very disappointing and "Into the Storm" is, by far, the worst.  There is no character development so we don't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other.  Basically, they've known each other, at best, casually through work - they sleep together - having the most amazing sex ever! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other.  Hmmm, that may work at 17, but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s.  They have very responsible, professional careers and by now, should know that love is based on far more than casual sex.    The situations SB keeps coming up with are becoming more and more amateurish and bizarre.  All of these factors caused me to quickly lose interest in the book and I began skimming pages hoping that something, somewhere would grab my attention.  No such luck.  I used to love reading SB novels.  I couldn't wait for new books to be published and I'd stay up late into the night reading.  No more.  In fact, I think I'm done with Brockmann.  Granted, I never read SB for the suspense.  I loved the character development, the character interaction and the adventure that made sense to the story.  If I want suspense, which appears to be where SB would rather go these days, I'd much rather spend my time and money reading Tess Gerritsen or Karin Slaughter.  They do suspense so much better 
 This is a disappointing book. There's nothing here but a loosely related collection of trivia. It reads like a long essay which became a short book because the author didn't know when to stop 
 ...for InDesign to not have one basic features. Everyone I know still does french folds, but in order to see double page spreads in InDesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program, then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page, layout by layout. This is mortally stupid. At this point Adobe should have figured how a tool like I.D. is actually used in conjunction with a printer, not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen. The oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool. Why isn't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output? Why do I have to slave over a document like this? Adobe, stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results.  Also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this? Mine shows me a heavily pixelated, entirely xparent BW image when it supposed to be a cropped color image. What do you want me to do with that 
 This is the worst idea a band has ever had. In particular, "damaged goods" is destroyed, removed of all of its original amazing tension. What we have now is an accomplished pub band rehashing past glory. Sad sad sad. Ladies and gentleman, give me Interpol over this. It pains me to say this. 
 I don't know what happened with this effort.  I have yet to stop listening to Hellbilly Deluxe and Sinister Urge.  However,I have listened to Educated Horses (through) once, maybe twice. I just cannot make myself listen to it.  And that is really sad because I love Rob Zombie and his music 
 OK, so the Intelligent Design thing didn't pan out.  It had a pretty good run in the press, and even the President got behind it.  But in the end, no peer-reviewed papers were published, no experiments were done, no testable hypotheses were advanced.  It was rejected by scientists, and eventually dismissed angrily by a conservative judge on the grounds that it was just old-fashioned mysticism.  But it still has a certain appeal.  I mean, shouldn't religion trump science when it comes to the big questions about life and the universe?  Like hot fudge on pancakes, you know the ideas are wrong, but they feel so right.  I've got an idea.  This may sound crazy, but hear me out.  Here's the idea:  Geocentrism.  That's right, I'm talking about the idea that the Sun revolves around the Earth.  I know, it sounds a little retro, but if you think about it there are certain advantages:  1)  The Bible doesn't say anything about evolution, but it's clearly (to the extent that it's clear about anything) geocentric:   "The world is firmly established, it will not be moved." (Ps. 93:1).  This will be something for the fundamentalists to rally around.  2)  Most scientists would agree that the evidence for heliocentrism (the idea that the Earth revolves around the Sun) is no better than the evidence for evolution.  3)  The main argument for geocentrism is identical to that of Intelligent Design.  Whether you call it common sense or personal incredulity, it boils down to just looking at the phenomenon in question and making up your own mind.  And the Sun looks like it revolves around the Earth, just as a bacterial flagellum (sort of) appears to have been designed.  4)  Most of the arguments against evolution are also arguments against heliocentrism.  Try this out:  "No one has ever observed the Earth going around the Sun."  It doesn't really make sense, but it sounds good!    5)  Bogus probability calculations work too.  Check this out:  The Earth consists of approximately 8.87x10^49 atoms.  Each atom is either revolving around the Sun or it's not.  Therefore the probability that the entire Earth is revolving around the Sun is 1/(2^(8.87x10^49)).  That's such a small number that it's IMPOSSIBLE that the Earth revolves around the Sun.  Tada!  6)  The same anti-evolution literature can be recycled and used against the heliocentrists.  Let's start talking about "fundamentalist heliocentric true believers" who won't even listen to geocentric arguments or allow them to be taught in schools.  Let's complain about the conspiracy between the liberal media and the atheist scientific establishment.  It'll be fun 
 The book was okay, but I really loved the movie.  There are major differences in the book that completely change the tone.  First of all, she's British and more closely resembles Bridget Jones than her movie counterpart.  You see a lot more of her friends in the novel.    Also, she seems thoroghly preoccupied with her weight.  She is not described to look anything like Debra Messing, but rather an overweight "squishy" girl, which is completely fine, but it is not fun to read abotu her obsessing about her weight while downing a box of chocolate cigarettes.  The writer is British, I believe, so it has more of the British slang, which at first is a little confusing.  It's not Thackeray, mind you, but don't expect any American tones.  Their relationship is more drawn out, which is fun to read.    Still, what I remember most was how we envision all the characters (Domonic included) as a little chunky.  They aren't size 0 models, we get it! Now get over it 
 She never has an appropriate ending. Can she go back to school and learn the "ABC's" of how to end a novel?  This was just lame.  You couldnt really get into the characters and I felt nothing for them.   Becasue of this book I will not read her novels again 
 There is a revised, updated version of this text (that is less expensive) - and if you order this one, Amazon will ship it to you, charge you for it and not refund the sale.  They claim that its not their fault that they'll ship you an outdated edition.  Check the publication date and get the updated softcover edition 
 The book was somewhat well-written, and parts were certainly enjoyable, but there is nothing that you can find here that you cannot find in greater detail and with more useful information somewhere else. The case notes were frequently short enough that you would have no real interest in the case, and it read more like a How-To book for someone interested in writing a medico-legal thriller, as long as the person writing that just wanted a lot of really general information without actually knowing enough of what they are talking about. If you really want a good general interest forensics book, check out What The Corpse Revealed by Hugh Miller. In short, the book had a lot of information in it, but none of it was unavailable or more useful here than other sources 
 I love the "smoky" piano bar sound of this album.  I picture my best girl having a couple of pops late at nigh 
 "Sweet Baby Jane" Perkins is a mega-selling rock star in need of a bodyguard and Jason Wilson, an ex-Army Ranger, is her man!   This is the first time I read a book by Cindy Gerard and maybe I should have tried a little bit harder, but it was a real struggle just to finish the first 50 pages. So it could be I didn't give it a fair chance.... but here's what I think.  The first thing that bothered me, was the fact that someone in the band is harassing Jane. I don't find the sexual harassement and obnoxious behavior believable: who is this guy anyway?? He is not the star of the show, he should have been fired long ago. Problem solved, but I guess he is needed for the storyline. What finished my attempt to continue to read the book is the fact that after something really awful has happened, Jane decides not to confide in the one person who stood by her all these years and made her in the star she is (namely her manager Max), for fear that he would cancel the gig. If I had read on I might have learned all the reasons why she feels that - no matter what - the show must go on. But frankly I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters and their lines and their emotions (up to page 50) just fell flat.   So..... for sale: a (hardly) used book in excellent condition! 
 After watching the tepid slasher flick "Slash," I asked several seemingly simple questions, none of which have easy answers. For example, I wondered aloud why we need yet another cheap, cheesy slasher film wannabe filled with annoying characters, near bloodless encounters between the baddie and the victims, and a connect the dots plot. Nonetheless, I gamely plodded through the entire movie, snorting and guffawing my way through what is largely a huge waste of time. I'll usually watch a horror movie no matter how bad it is. As a hardcore fan of the genre, I feel it necessary to absorb as much of the material out there as possible. Good or bad, I march onward through the mountains of straight to video horror DVDs, discovering that for every diamond in the rough there are dozens of other movies so bad that they'll curl your toenails. "Slash" leans toward the latter position; it's not the absolute worst film to come down the pipe in the last five to ten years, but it's far from good. It is, rather, a forgettable film that every filmmaker wishing to direct a horror film should watch so they know what not to do.    At the center of "Slash" is the "rock" band Slash, an up and coming group of "talented" musicians looking for that big break. The front man for the group, "Mac" MacDonald (James O'Shea), hides a hideous secret. When he was a child Mac witnessed a bizarre incident involving his grandfather Jethro (Danny Keogh), an incident involving stacks of bodies and something called the blood harvest. An accident led to the sudden departure of Jethro, and shortly thereafter Mac and his mother left father and headed to the big city. Mac's managed to submerge the disturbing memories of his childhood spent on the farm until he receives word after a show that his aunt passed away. Unfortunately, the trip to the funeral could very well interfere with the band's chances to sign a recording deal with a big label. Since Mac is the main guy, the group decides to attend the services. They all hop on the bus and cruise out to the MacDonald farm for a meet and greet with Mac's wacky family. Along for the ride is the band and a few hangers on, the most important of which-and the only memorable ones-are Mac's main squeeze Suzie (Zuleikha Robinson) and angry black guy Keith (Craig Kirkwood). Things get weird quickly once they show up on the farm. It turns out some nut in a black costume's been going around rubbing people out with various farm implements, and now he or she is going to turn their focus on the members of Slash.     Until the sauce starts to flow, we get a close look at the kooks on the farm. First up is Jeremiah MacDonald (Steve Railsback), a true hick in every sense of the word, who spends his time whipping up moonshine, joshing with the out of towners, and acting in a threatening manner. Jeremiah's sidekick is Billy Bob (Nick Boraine), a shuffling slow poke who takes great delight in provoking the band members, especially Keith. A few members of the band disappear because of various encounters with the man in black while Mac slowly slips into a weird trance related in no small part to his returning to the family homestead. After the funeral, where we catch a glimpse of a female version of the Crazy Ralph character from "Friday the 13th," the band expects to just roll right out of Weirdsville, USA. Yeah right. Something happens to the bus (surprise!), requiring the hapless youngsters to stay at the farm until the part arrives from the big city. It sure looks as though Slash will never make that all important recording contract meeting. In fact, they'll probably need to place a few ads in the trade mags for replacement musicians by the time this whole thing wraps up.    I'm wracking my brain in order to find something nice to say about "Slash." The only thing I can come up with is Nick Boraine's character, Billy Bob. Boraine plays the stereotypical redneck hick quite well. Regrettably, what doesn't work at all could fill volumes. Keith, for example, is the most annoying character imaginable, a guy whose constant harping on racism tires quite quickly. And what's he doing with a gun, anyway? Too, the constant sniggering from the rest of the musicians about life on the farm sure doesn't endear these characters to a viewer. I roared with laughter when Billy Bob showed up after the concert to notify Mac about the funeral, and the whole room went completely silent as he walked in. Are city folks this afraid of someone from the countryside? Never mind the city is a thousand times more dangerous than any farm! But the worst problem plaguing "Slash" is the absence of gore. In a slasher film, taking it easy on the bloodshed is a crime of epic proportions. Oh sure, there are a few scenes involving a bit of the red stuff, but it's all so minor compared to other pictures that the movie should have earned a 'PG' rating instead of an 'R'. And that conclusion! Oh brother!    Extras on the disc include a trivia game (yawn), and trailers for "Slash," "Lawless Heart," and "Purpose." The movie's picture transfer is fullscreen. As a lover of B budget movies even I have to say that "Slash," when it could have been a gorefest, is a borefest instead. Marred by bad acting, bad editing, bad pacing, bad effects, bad direction, and a downright abysmal soundtrack; "Slash" is best left lying on the video store shelf. See it if you absolutely must watch nearly every straight to video horror movie around, but don't say that I didn't warn you.    
 I felt this book was to much like other ghost story collections and really embelished a great deal of facts 
 This book was a total disappointment.  It didn't tell me anything different from the information that I received free from my hospital.  I was so frustrated when I got home from the hospital and I had read this book about a month before my daughter was born.  The best advice I can give is to see a lactation consultant at the hospital where your child was born or see if you can have someone come in and actually help you have your baby latch on.  The book has zero information as to how to wean your child as well.    
 I have to preface this by saying that I absolutely love eating at the candle. So delicious. before we moved from NYC, I thought we HAVE to get this book. We've tried several of the recipies, following them to the letter, and have been really dissapointed everytime - with the exception of the  hummus.  I think that they must be leaving out some key ingredients in a lot of these recipies, because all of the ones we have attempted have been either completely flavorless, or tasted like salt. Don't even bother with the soups unless you are a gourmet cook and can figure out how to punch them up somehow after following these directions, because they all end up runny and bland. so sad 
 Buyer be ware if you have a problem with delivery or the TV you will be left on your own to sort it out. Amazon may or may not be a big trust worthy company, but they will still leave it to you to sort out there is no personal customer service other then email (run around)!! Bare that in mind before making any large purchase, may be better to pay a little more through a company with a store front at least you will have someone to complain to face to face or take the item back 
 The book gives you a nice overview of the atmosphere etc. that makes it a fun read as you anticipate the trip.  However the maps that I tried to use in Rome, were off by a few blocks each time - only a problem when you didn't have another source of information. This is a book that I'd suggest as your 3rd or 4th one to get - not the first one 
 Our church book study group mistakenly purchased this Bad Girls of the Bible instead of the one by the other author.  While I had great difficulty getting through the first chapter, I am now using this book to improve my understanding of the Bible, and to learn more about ancient times.    This writer makes-up her own story lines, and conveniently leaves out portions of chapters and verses that do not fit her story line.  For example, in chapter two, she states that Egypt where Joseph is held as a slave by Potiphar, is a dry hot land.  Perhaps she should read just a little earlier in the Bible. In Genesis 13:10, we are told different. 10 Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar.  While the ordering of this book was a mistake on the part of the person who ordered the books for us, I believe it is a Godsend for us to read and discuss this book, though I doubt we will actually be using the questions at the end of each chapter.  Instead we will ask questions regarding her inaccurate portrayal of these women and the facts of history. 
 The author believes that France's economy, and socialism generally, is admirable. This, against all evidence to the contrary. Really, how much more of this sort of wishful thinking masquerading as economic analysis are we expected to take? Haven't we had enough demonstration of the falsity of these ideas? As socialist economies drag their shuddering bulks to standstills while the people riot (and rot), we are expected to heed calls to admire, and replicate, their failures. Amazing. Read Hayek. Von Mises. Sowell. Friedman. This guy, here, should never have been published 
 My son wrote the first review right after we got the V-drop. He loved playing with it for 1 day but then the device that brings the car up to the top stopped working. I couldn't believe it. He suggested that we bring it back to the store so we could get something else. So that's what we did, but I said no more hot wheels stuff for awhile. This was one of many Hot Wheels birthday presents. 
 According to an article by Wendell Cox, senior fellow for The Heartland Institute, this book rehashes the tired claims about suburbanization (pejoratively called "urban sprawl") being unnecessarily costly. In fact, however, Sprawl Costs: Economic Impacts of Unchecked Development (by Robert Burchell, Anthony Downs, Barbara McCann, and Sahan Mukheri) relies on prospective data that is soundly refuted by reality.  The book is an outgrowth of a study led by Burchell, which concluded that more compact (less suburban) development could save $225,000,000,000 in government spending over 25 years. The study made the all-too-common error of concluding that many zeros after a number make it significant. They do not. It will probably take the average reader at least 225,000,000,000 nanoseconds to read this article. $225 billion over 25 years is less than $30 per capita each year. This is a pittance in comparison with overall government expenditures, which have risen more than 100 times that fast over the past 25 years after adjustment for inflation.  Aside from the shock value, the validity of the numbers is questionable. In fact, the suburbs are not more expensive. Joshua Utt and I published research analyzing Bureau of the Census data for more than 700 municipalities concluding that actual (not theoretical) per-capita public expenditures are lowest in the newer suburbs. Even sewer costs were found to be lowest in the newer suburbs. The principal reasons are that politics, congestion, and labor costs drive costs higher in more compact development.  Sprawl Costs' weakest assertion may be that more compact development would reduce the cost of an average new house $16,000, a conjecture that ignores economic reality. To accomplish the more compact development Burchell et al. would prefer requires stringent regulation, such as urban growth boundaries, greenbelts, and other limits on development. Rationing land, like anything else, results in higher prices. Edward Glaeser and Joseph Gyourko, in work published by Harvard University, reported that the principal cause of differences in housing affordability among U.S. metropolitan areas is zoning and land regulation.  The current "housing bubble" is most pronounced where there is strong land rationing-places like California, Portland, and the Northeast, from Boston to Washington's Virginia and Maryland suburbs. In the past five years actual house prices in those areas have risen $200,000 more than the average in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Houston, growth dynamos where there is little land rationing. In just five years, the conjectural $16,000 savings over 25 years have been consumed 12 times over by the actual excess price increases in areas that have implemented the very strategies required to compel the compact development advocated by Burchell et al.  Moreover, with minority home ownership in the U.S. a full third below the Non-Hispanic White homeownership rate, the cost-increasing effects of land rationing are today denying opportunity and blocking the ladder to the economic mainstream. Of course, the higher prices will also drive other millions out of the homeownership market.  All of this shifts wealth from young to old and poorer to richer in a perverse trickle-up economy. The American Dream is under threat. A nation of renters will be less affluent.  None of this is to suggest that suburbanization should be the favored form of urban development. Instead, people should be allowed to live and work where and how they like. Anti-suburban interests have yet to find a compelling reason why this should not be so.  Sprawl Costs misses the economic opportunities and wealth that have been created by broad home ownership, made possible by building new houses on inexpensive land in the suburbs. It is not surprising that virtually all urban growth in the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand has been suburban for decades. Consumers know better. What Burchell et al. perceive as costs are really benefits.

 Filled with lots of opinion unsubstantiated by facts (although much of it probable true) and very redundant...about five pages in the whole book actually worth reading and that information can be had many places in the financial press.  A waste of my money and time 
 I'm sure that this would be a wonderful book for anyone interested in the history of the fantasy genre - including movies and television shows, characters and certain authors.  However, if you are looking for a book that contains information of the fantasy world itself (ie. mythical beasts, worlds, spells, etc...), like I was, this is definately the wrong book for you.  I am a fantasy writer and was looking for information that would help in my writing.  This book, now that I have had a good look at it, will sit on my shelf and collect dust until I can find someone to give or sell it to.  If you are looking for information on movies, this is a book for you... If not, then don't waste your time and money on this book.  It is not worth it 
 Pat picked too many mainstream metal songs to cover here. It would have been cooler and more ballsy to have picked songs from bands like Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, GWAR, and Goo Goo Dolls 
 I've always looked upon "Christian" fiction with a rather wary eye.  It has less to do with the subject matter than the lesser quality of these works; it's as if the publishers cynically assumed that merely presenting something as "Christian" would be enough to guarantee a certain level of readership, no matter how poorly written the book is (this is often done with science fiction and fantasy as well).  Three (or more properly, Thr3e) by Ted Dekker has done little to alter my view.  (Why did I read the book?  Because when I bought it (along with another Dekker book), I didn't realize fully what I was buying.)  Three tells the story of Kevin Parson, a seminary student who suffered from a strange, semi-abusive childhood.  He gets a phone call one day warning him that unless he solves a riddle within three minutes, his car will explode.  Kevin doesn't solve the riddle and the car does blow up, but he escapes intact.  Thus begins a cat-and-mouse game with Slater, who may or may not be a serial killer named the Riddle Killer.  Slater believes that Kevin has committed a grave sin that requires confession or death.  Kevin, along with his childhood friend Samantha (now a state cop) and Jennifer Peters (an FBI agent) try and hunt down Slater, but Slater is apparently too clever to be caught easily.  There is not much that is truly Christian about this book other than a few religious lines (never getting very preachy) and the definitely PG-rated material:  the language is gentle enough, the romance is chaste and the violence is relatively bloodless.  I'm fine with all that as long as the story's good, and that's not the case here.  It's actually too bad, because Dekker seems like a decent enough plotter, but the story relies on a plot twist that is one of the most annoying in suspense fiction; I won't say what it is, but even Dekker seems a bit uncomfortable with it, as he spends a lot of time rationalizing it.  In addition, to perpetrate this twist, he has to actively deceive (not merely mislead) the reader, which is a cheat.  In addition, even though Dekker has a good sense of plot (till the end) and he is able to maintain a fast, tense pace, he is overall, just a passable writer.  I suppose technically his work is proficient, but compared to the great names in crime stories (Elmore Leonard, Michael Connelly, Lee Child, etc.), Dekker's prose is just flat.  With a two-star rating, it is not the worst book out there, but it is one to avoid. 
 Awful, NOT a book to read to children. . . really opjectional 
 I bought it given reviews by others, but my one must have been faulty coz it worked for about 1 second after installing it and it hasn't worked ever since.  I'd suggest any would be buyer pay a bit more for something that works 
 If you don't like seeing the message "Unable to connect to preferred wireless network," then don't waste your time with this God-awful piece of crap.  I lose my Internet connection once or twice every single time I'm online.  The other computer in my network is a 6-year-old Dell with a Netgear card, and I have not once lost my connection on it, and the Internet is much faster.  My computer is a new eMachines, but with this junky D-Link card, and the Internet is barely usable.  Also, the two computers are in adjacent rooms, so range is not a factor at all.  They are both running off a Linksys router.  I have had problems with other D-Link products as well.  I had a network bridge which I returned because after following all the instructions and calling tech support, it just didn't work.  Also, before the Linksys router, I had a D-Link one for about two weeks before I returned it because of its very slow speeds and inability to maintain a connection.  Don't waste your time with D-Link.  If you are starting a network from scratch, I would recommend getting all Linksys components 
 Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy are all back with another good guy gets bad guy caper.  The bad guy in this case is mad at Lucy because of something she inadvertantly caused when she was 17 that ruined his life.  So he winds up stalking her and killing others.  What the fabulous four don't know is that the individual crimes they are each investigating all wind up being linked together and committed by the same bad guy.  The story also places much emphasis on their personal lives which all pretty much suck.  They are all alone and miserable in their own ways and don't seem to be able to do much about it.    Sadly, I can't muster up anything nice to say about this book.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the fondness I still have for the early books in the series.  Once upon a time I bought the new releases in this series the day the hardback came out and stayed up all night to read them.  But with this one, there is nothing about it that makes it worth reading.  There are even places where the grammar is just horribly and shockingly incorrect.  Cornwell didn't used to be this sloppy or seem to care so little for a series that she spent such time and effort developing.  I hate to see them go, but after the next one (which unfortunately I already bought) I think I'm done 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 It's difficult to believe that John Patrick Shanley, shortly after winning an Oscar for "Moonstruck," penned this abominable movie.  What was he thinking?  "The January Man" tries to be a comedy, a mystery, a romance, and a thriller, but it fails miserably on all levels.  With an all-star cast including Kevin Kline, Alan Rickman, Rod Steiger, Susan Sarandon, and Harvey Keitel, you'd think this would be a gem.  Alas, it's just a big mess with an implausible storyline, awful dialogue, and no chemistry between the actors.  It's rare and appalling to see so much talent produce so poor of a movie 
 For a book about such an emotional music, this "matter of fact" account of the blues is totally without feeling.  Davis is cynical about most previous beliefs of the blues and is absolutely critical of current  blues artists who have attempted to keep the earliest blues alive.  This  author lacks the charm and scope of an Alan Lomax or a Samuel Charters.   Although the book contained information, it was dull and sometimes  annoying 
 Don't be fooled by the title of this cookbook.  First, it is filled with exotic and gourmet, not to mention expensive, recipies.  The choice of ingredients might be fine if you live in New York or San Francisco, but here in northern Wisconsin many ingredients just aren't available.  (And if they were, would you fix squab or fried rabbit for Tuesday night dinner for your family?)  A second disappointment is the copious use of butter, oil and heavy cream.  This is the first time I've ever been so disappointed in a book I ordered that I will be returning it 
 Mr. Bennett shows a sad, vindictive streak in this book, which I had not expected from him.  He acts as if the whole point of politics is to win debates, using whatever vitriol necessary to score points, with no regard  for civility or morality.  It is nice to see that for all his  liberal-bashing in this text, he found better ground in the future, for in  his book on virtues he explicitly makes the point that good, moral people  can be liberals or conservatives.   If you can ignore the rampant hatred,  he makes some decent points.  The section on drug policy is a great read,  much nicer than his assault on teacher unions when he supposedly is writing  about education.    I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone, though  it has some positive features.  There are more open-minded and insightful  political writers out there, like Michael Lind, Richard John Neuhaus or Jim  Wallis.  Let's not confine ourselves to the angry complaints of a bureacrat  like Bennett 
 There are three persons who talk about their past. But the point is that they don't really talk about old times. Everyone tells things that happened in the past and no one knows if they are true. Those things have no  context. They are a lot of sexual  hints by Deeley. Also strange is that  Deeley didn't tell his wife that he already knows Anna. We don't recommend  this book because we didn't understand well the sense of the story. In this  story you have to read between the lines, and it could happen that even  then you are not able to understand the play 
 This movie should have won an Oscar.  The acting was superb.  Kate Capshaw and Elle McPherson were so convincing as lesbians.  Their common interest of Jazz and love for clubs composed of all butch lesbians, but them (of course), is compelling drama unfolding before your eyes.  The writing is amazing.  The nonexistant plotline between them had me captivated and wanting more.  Stockard Channing was aspiring as a pyschologist.  She made me feel like I could go to her about any problem and she would solve it in an instant.  The stoned looked in her eyes provided a security unmatched in real life.  The twists and turns provided in The Three Sisters story was like a M Night Shyamalan movie.  I won't say anything in fear of spoiling the ultimate surprise!    All in all I feel like this movie brought me to a state of complete bliss.  With dialogue like two men saying (...) over an over again and heartwarming original characters like Alice or Claire - a nontoken black maid and homophobic turned obsessive stalker jealous needy clingy apologetic friend - I feel like I should give up writing because nothing will top a masterpiece of this caliber 
 Absolutely no logic. Perfectly nonclear. No subject. Mathematically poor.(very poor.) Nonneccessary words. No depth. Not for self-study. Just arrangement. No physical insight. No process. No thinking.  This is indeed not a book.  This is a stuff for a vanity. I wonder whether Peskin and Schroeder are genuine physicists.  
 This book is a crock.  It is full of fallacies that the author presents as "truth" to those who don't know any better.  Granted, the "master cleanser diet" might very well work (I've decided against it) and the author is fairly up-front of the negative effects one will likely experience.  But the explanations and claims this book makes are ridiculous.  The author claims that there are no such thing as disease-causing bacteria and viruses.  Also, he claims that the lack of protein in this diet is not a problem because your body will assimilate nitrogen and carbon from the air you breathe into the components of protein.  Take an introductory biology class, Stanley Burroughs, before you make such laughable claims.  
 Unfortunatley, Ms. Ornstein's book is not based on actual research, but rather on pre-established suppositions. The gender climate of a school is best evaluated by looking at two factors - student grades and disciplinary actions.  If male students have lower grades than female students, and/or if more male students are disciplined than female students, then it is clear that the school is anti-boy and is simply not trying to teach male students.  Fortunatley, parents are waking up to this fact, and there have been several lawsuits (most notably in Wisconsin) challenging public schools gender bias against male students.  The so called "gender-fair" class menitoned in this book wasn't - since not as many male as female students received "A's".    This book also does not evaluate issues outside of school.  For example, the best measure of the status of a demographic group is to look at mortality rate.  The fact that male students in all demographic groups have a higher mortality rate than female students is not discussed.  This is particularly important since a major contributing factor to this trend is the fact that adolescent males have a higher suicide rate than adolescent females.  Orenstein also does not discuss this gender gap in arrest rate.  Again, the "health" of a demographic group in school is easy to evaluate - simply look at grades and discipline.  
 I am using this as a medium to communicate with you cos I do not know any other since i am new to amazon. It's been a while I purchased your book, so where is my book?  Please take prompt actions 
 The only real crime surrounding this film was the murder of Chandler's story. This is just another example of someone capitalizing on someone else's reputation to sell a film. Gould is about as much Marlowe as Pee Wee Herman is Mike Hammer - i.e., there is no resemblence. Additionally, the cinematography is terrible - it looks like a cheap 70's movie shot in video instead of film. There's absolutely no suspense, nor snappy delivery of lines by Gould. I can only imagine that anyone who liked this movie probably cared more about Marlowe's bare-topped neighbors than anything else, because there's almost nothing of redeeming value in this movie. For those fans of real noir and/or hard-boiled detective pulp, don't waste your money or time watching this junk. You'll be disappointed. 
 (it?)I have many of David and Japan's albums, but this thinly composed album is repetitive, boring and annoying. I think there were some hidden tracks too, but I just wanted the album to be over. You are better off with "Dead Bees on a Cake" , "Secrets of the Beehive" or any bee related titled album of his 
 Let me first say that I am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book; I am extremely committed to healthy food choices, environmentally sound policies, and all the basic values Gary Null ostensibly embraces.  I have no problem with Null's basic premise that we should consume a fresh, non-processed, plant-based diet(although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier), buy organic food when at all possible, and avoid toxic household products.  But I am totally outraged by Gary Null's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues.  I bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy-new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points.  We don't need any more evidence that a plant-based diet low in trans-fats is healthier than eating at McDonalds.  This book adds NOTHING legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source, and is far inferior to, for instance, "The Food Pharmacy" by Jean Carper, in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references.  Save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce 
 Purchased three of these at Christmas.  Horns and lights did not work on but one, another was missing keys when delivered, luckily interchangable.  Within 5 days, one four wheeler had a faulty throttle and quit, the drive train fell out of the other with bolts going everywhere, and the third had two bald tires which burst!  All this before the new year turned.  I contacted the company, and they offered assistance by sending a box of parts in the mail.  However, they offered no assistance on actual repair, telling me that "any man can do it with a few tools".  After several hours and a visit to the tire shop, I fixed the bikes and they seem to work fine for now.  I obviously question the quality of the product and be aware return shipping is not an option b/c these bikes are heavy and it would be cost prohibitive.  I would buy at a store where I could take back if needed.  Good luck.    
 Attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003... bad move... none of my access 97 programs work now... in fact I, I brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions... nope... the upgrade just didn't work.....had to purchase a full version to set things right... save your money on this product.. 
 I found out that there isn't any difference with Adkins for Life from the first book.  Disappointing,  I tried both with a group of folks from work and we all have had the same results.  However, I never support anything unless I have been convinced it truly does what it says and I found that with "the average joes diet."  A friend told me about it and I was always considered the fat girl.  No longer! and it's stayed off. 
 I really started out liking this story.  Loved the New Orleans setting and the idea of ghost hunting combined with a possible hoodoo/voodoo connection.  But the character of Cree Black got on my nerves so bad that I found myself not caring much about her one way or the other.  She is supposed to be a 'brilliant' Ph.D in psychology, but she's an emotional train wreck who can hardly navigate her way through life.  Why anyone would pay her thousands to exorcise their ghosts is beyond me.  She's ineffectual, totally incapable of intimacy, lies compulsively to her friends and family, and seems stuck in this self-pity time warp over her husband who died 9 years ago!  Please!  
 All of the "glowing" and "raving" reviews of this product were all entered on April 24 or April 25.  Coincidence?  I think not.  These are people paid by Strivectin for their "honest" reviews... 
 I watched the movie DRIVING MRS DASIE with my mother and it had cooler cars than the ones in this movie.  It looked like the drivers stole these cars from the parking lot of the BINGO CLUB or a senior citizens house or something.  I didnt see a single tank of nitrous in the whole thing.  No subwoofers, no cop chases no anything a couple 25 ft long drag races that my mom probably could have one.  This is the worst video ever.  Anyone that gives it more than the worst rating possible only did it because they were either in the movie or because get some of the profit if it sells.  I cant believe I spent any money on this piece of junk.  DO NOT BUY IT, SPEND A COUPLE MORE BUCKS AND GET THE MOVIE MISCHIEF 3000. It has cars in it worth racing and it has police chases and hot frickin chicks. 
 Just received the German 4 disc digipak. GOOD NEWS. played 10 mins of both - no problems. Menus are all in English (or German) all the extra's on the English R2 SE's are here except for the photo gallery.  The sound is very good and the restored english mono is BETTER than the MGM 5.1 also on here with the commentary and German mono. The 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation.  Picture. No problems I could see on my 6ft screen via InFocus 5700 projector from an Arcam FMJ-DV29 DVD player. Player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything.  Only watched first 10mins of each but doing A-B comparisons with the English R2 MGM SE's the German ones are noticeably better, they look less washed out, contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on Fistful, which is why I bought this set, but also on Few Dollars More as well.  They are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly Few Dollars More is at last the full version, which no MGM DVD is worldwide..... 
 Eugene O'Neill's play "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing.  
 This movie had some good potental in the opening, after that, it looses all grip on everything, the plot of the movie is based on a new JSF style creation fighter FA-37, and a new VTO&L controlled artificially by a "AI", one thing leads to another the "AI" goes haywire during a lighting storm, it starts acting on it's own to destroy "threats" one thing leads to another their in Tajikistan setting off dirty nuclear weapons, north korea, russia for absoulutly no reason breaking numerus international laws, at one point in the movie, the star of the movie "falon 1" helps destroy intercepting fighters with the "AI" whois hes ment to track down breaking a bunch of laws himself, and is treated like a hero at the end.  It's a backwards movie, don't watch it, please don't 
 C. S. Lewis exposed the circular reasoning in Hume in the book "Miracles."  David Hume was not a skeptic.  He was a freemason and therefore a gnostic.  He was only skeptical of nongnostic positions, such as Christianity.  He was an apologist for gnosticism.  He had blind faith allegiance to the masonic lodge and its creed.  His argument against miracles is his chief argument against Christianity, and it suffers from circular reasoning.  Circular reasoning you exclaim?  Yes.  Hume argued that miracles violate uniform experience.  However, if uniform experience is against mircales, then they cannot happen.  Uniform experience is his presupposition.  But, uniform experience is defined to exclude miracles.  If they didn't happen, well, they didn't happen.  This begs the question.  I have a better argument than Lewis's.  I would simply point out that pure logic cannot dispense with the empirical question of whether miracles happen.  Afterall, mathematics is made up of tautologies.  As such, mathematics or logic or any formal reasoning cannot have physical meaning.  Pure logic, as Hume employs, cannot tell us anything about the world.  Therein lies the sophistry.  It boils down to the distinction between analytic statements and synthetic statements.  Whether or not miracles happen depends not on logic, but on the existence of God who intervenes in human affairs.  As the former atheist Antony Flew said, it is impossible to argue against the existence of God in light of the evidence of intelligent design of the universe.  If anyone went to the moon and found a house there that supplied oxygen, food and other human necessities, they wouldn't hesitate to posit a creator of that house.  So why would anyone question the existence of God in light of this wonderful planet that supports our lives?  What is remarkable about him is how irrational he is.  He possesses a flair for writing and shows great promise in reasoning.  Yet, he sacrifices good reasoning for pushing his gnostic agenda.  It's like a person who graduates from medical school who decides to murder patients, or a graduate from law school who chooses to rob banks.  He tries to use reasoning to support irrational thought.  Hume was a strange man.  The engine is running, but there's no one behind the wheel.  
 I was going to buy this but at this price I expect a correct photograph and description. I'm also a bit concerned about the warranty. 6 months seems a little short, all things considered. And I bought a reconditioned kitchenaid food processor last year and not only was the item not properly described but the warranty was not what was stated on Amazon's web page 
 This was a hugely disappointing film. I did not see it on stage nor do I want to if it is ever resurrected. It trivializes illness, death, God, heaven, range of human emotion and love in all forms. I have grown up in a post-AIDS world and can see so many problems far worse than AIDS.I am tired of listening to actors drone on in selfish pursuits. While America focuses on such banal subject matter, larger more urgent problems are clearly ignored by a society that thinks it has the luxury of still trying to come to grips with sexuality 
 i had to read this book for a class and was very dissapointed in it. instead of telling a story this book layed out the facts like a us history text book. It basically was a textbook without the pictures. it was very hard to finish, but i did learn 
 Poorly produced with a few radical concepts about sport-specific conditioning as it relates to golf. I doubt anybody on tour uses this stuff, just too funky 
 The professionals in the law field in this book aren't the type of lawyer or law professional most people want to become.  I understand not everyone becomes a six-figure-paid lawyer right out of law school, but this book is ridiculous.  It shadows a guy who wants to only be a law clerk?  Give me a break 
 This novel was the hardest I have ever read. It was not due to content, but due to the writing itself. Welty's writing reminds of a combination of Faulkner and Chekhov, only without any skill. The characters were never developed, the plot was weak, and the book as a whole was disappointing literature. It turned me off of Eudora Welty completly 
 Buy this only if you're working on a George Strait collection.  "It's listenable" is the only nice thing I can say about it.  I do like George Strait's music but this one is uninspired, unimaginative and boring 
 I dont recommend these for 1st person shooter gamers. Impossible to tell if enemy is in front or behind you. Probably ok if direction of sound is not important to you. Left and right work ok but not front/rear for some reason. My hp laptop earbuds work better 
 I'm an agronomist and I like to read books. This book is weak.In fact, when someone lent this trash-book, I didn't even ended it. When the part about the brazilian Chico Mendes came, I decided not to continous.This book claims that Chico Mendes was a good man.Even respecting the life and being against Chico Mendes' murder, I must tell you that Chico Mendes did nothing good, for Brazil or any of his followers.The real thing who Chico Mendes and all of so called "environmentalists" gave to Acre's souls and in fact all brazilian people was and is: poverty, corruption, recession and frauds. Ecologism or environmentalim is nothing more than a new name for eugenics. This book is ridiculous puting good people and rogue people, in the same basket of the godless religion of environmentalism. To preserve the so called "Nature" replaced the will to preserve, the so called "Race".The prejudices and goals of eugenics in the past are the same as ecology today.Even the "phillantropic" american foundations of eugenics and ecology are the same:Rockefeller, MacArthur, Kellogg, Carnegie,etc. are now gaving massive fortunes to ecologists, such as they were giving massive amount of money to eugenicists some decades ago. Eugenics = ecology ; To preserve the "race" = To preserve the "nature". Rockefeller = Rockfeller ;Carnegie = Carnegie ; Kellogg = Kellogg.   
 Not Happy at all with these slippers.  Do not buy them.  They lasted 3-4 week and then he inside was shot.  
 I have cooked several recipes from this cookbook and found them all to be rather bland.  The cooking techniques, as well as the spicing, seems to be tailored for "American tastes" and this results in a less than satisfying result.  This is yet another "ethnic" cookbook which patronizes its readers with assumptions about how we cook, what we like, and what ingredients we have access to in the market 
 I should have examined this book more closely before purchasing. It's not a learning tool, most of the chapters focus on following directions with no real explanation why. Needless to say this will leave people out to sea when it comes time to fly solo. That situation is exacerbated by the fact that the book doesn't match the cd contents, so it's impossible sometimes to follow even the step-by-step procedures... not that they would teach you much anyway. Unfortunately for the publisher, the code given is also buggy... adding the final nail in the coffin for this book. Stay away, don't waste your money, there are better resources to learn from.  
 The most boring text book I have ever read. info was not well presente 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 American presidents, understandably and out of what must be very close to grammatical necessity, have always used the pronoun "We" to speak of American policy. Yet in 2002, Berry said President Bush's use of this "We" was the royal "we" and ran counter to the Declaration of Independence.    Rather than being laughed at, Berry's essay has been anthologized and praised.  It's time to speak the truth: never have inanity and insipidity been so fused in one author to the extent that they are fused in the ridiculous Wendell Berry. 
 I checked this book out at my local library thinking there might actually be something useful to help me diversify my online income.  I was greatly disappointed.  Not only does this book repeat what just about every other book on earning money online talks about, but it also involves many things that could be considered SPAM and annoying practices.  The author states he is against those practices and insists that his techiniques are fine, but I can't help but get a bit sick to my stomach when reading his tips.  Also, he claims its super-easy to make lots of quick money, but even with his deceiptful tactics, you will still need a good product (which he doesn't tell you how to develop) in order to sell anything worthwhile.  Please do yourself and the rest of the Internet community a favor and don't both with this book 
 This book provides a cursory treatment of a deep subject.  At barely 250 pages of main body text--and they are small pages at that, set in a generous type--there is no room to go into detail on much of anything.  You will learn, perhaps, what a dataflow diagram or an IDEF0 frame is, but you will certainly not learn how to create or manipulate them, or much about how to use them, or their relative strengths and weaknesses, beyond the casual sentence or two about any given model in this book.  And, look, I love diagrams, but it seems like every third illustration is this book is a reprint or an absolutely trivial variation on the author's "EA Cube" overview diagram.  You can see it on the front cover--it's not exactly as complicated as the human nervous system.  Once or twice would have done it for me.  Shallow?  I slosh through deeper puddles on a rainy day.    But the shining feature of this book is the "case study" of a company adopting the particular flavor of Enterprise Architecture that Scott Bernard is trying to sell, something called EA3.  He follows this ficticious company through the entire course of the book, costing a substantial fraction of the already meager pagecount.  What would you expect such a case study to entail, dear reader?  Maybe some process diagrams, data entity schemas, architecture documents...you know, an ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE for the example company?  Sadly, the joke is on us.  None of this is forthcoming.  The "case study" consists almost entirely of descriptions of meetings where everybody talks about the wonderful things they're going to do with this new enterprise architecture, followed by more meetings where everybody congatulates each other on the wonderful things they've just done thanks to enterprise architecture.  Like the rest of the book, there is just no "there" there.  Actual models?  No room!  Sample documents?  No time!  Any business school or MIS student who tried to hand in this pollyanna sales pitch as a "case study" would only get an F because the grade scale doesn't go to "G."  Perhaps the only value in this book is that, if read critically, it will teach you a great deal about why "Enterprise Architecture" has such a poor reputation in certain sectors of industry today.  I really think that a lot of EA is about self-aggrandizement on the part of IT professionals, who think the entire business should revolve around their pretty diagrams and three-ring binders.  We in the IT community need to get our minds right: we are here to support and enable the business, not impede it or, worse, subordinate it to its tools.  If something like Enterprise Architecture is good for business, then we need to find ways to do it that don't involve saying to the people we are supposed to be helping: "Wait!  Stop what you're doing and redefine everything you do according to MY methodology!"  Read the first five pages of the "case study" in this book to see the new CIO do EXACTLY THAT.  He should have been laughed out of the boardroom.    
 This is a relatively short book covering 2500 years of history. Unfortunately, rather than giving us a good overview of the different periods and the main players, the writers fill the book with names and towns that confuse the reader and make it difficult to follow.  I was very disappointed 
 Books that rely mostly upon miscellaneous snippets of conversations and diary entries while providing only minimal context and understanding to explain an historical event, are invariably inadequate and even frustrating. The author, apparently a modern day resident of Richmond, VA, seems compelled to describe the fall of Richmond, the capital of the Confederacy, and a subsequent day-long fire, occurring in about a two-week period from the end of March to April 15 of 1865, in such a manner.  Because it is elites whose actions and thoughts were usually recorded in historical times, it is the movements and views of such individuals as Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy's president, various officials of the VA and Richmond governments,  the military officers of both the North and South, and of some national figures such as Lincoln and Stanton that occupy most of the book. And then there are also the "man on the street" contributions. The evacuation of Richmond was only a matter of time as Union forces had it and nearby cities virtually surrounded and paralyzed by the Spring of 1865. The breakthrough of Grant at Petersburg, VA necessitated an order on Sunday, April 2, from Lee to evacuate Richmond and with it came the directive to burn the bridges crossing the James River below Richmond and all tobacco warehouses. At this point the story gets very disconnected and confusing.  The scrambling of various parties in Richmond to evacuate or otherwise deal with the coming of Union forces is covered in a scattershot manner. Despite a few maps of the area being provided, it is virtually impossible to fully grasp who is moving in what direction, in what sequence, and to what final effect. The motivation for burning the tobacco warehouses remains mostly a mystery. Surely, the threat of fire in a wooden-built city would have raised huge alarms. The author never discusses the ramifications to the people of Richmond of the fire that burned the central business district and, as well, many residences. What were the actual mechanisms for coping short-term and long?  The author provides some insight into future social divisions in the South in the contrasting reactions to the arrival of Union troops: Union sympathizers and now-freed blacks could not contain their joy while whites favoring secession looked on morosely. The visit of Lincoln, no more than a day-and-a-half after the evacuation, is interesting largely from the standpoint of how little concern he showed for his own safety, traveling up the mine-laden James River and immersing himself in crowds in Richmond. The half-baked scheme where a former US Supreme Ct justice, John Campbell, and now soon-to-be ex-Confederate official, prevailed upon Lincoln to permit the reassembling of the VA State legislature to bypass the unionist legislature was a short-lived initiative completely short-circuited by the surrender at Appomattox.   The odds and ends of an historical event are of interest, but those alone are insufficient. One suspects there are far better books on the role of Richmond in the Confederacy that provide context for the fall of the Confederacy including what happened in Richmond.  
 This is the last item I will ever purchase from Sharper Image...it broke the second week I had it...spewing hand soap at will and not when I placed my hand under the infrared sensor.  It's pure crap.  Stay away!! 
 After reading this book, i tossed it in the trash, realizing that I had been taken for profit. This review is to save your time and money. Then I realized the Truth!.. It is impossible that these reviews are real. "An Encounter with a Prophet" is a poorly written, self-published with stilted writing lacking cohesion and totally lacking insight into Truth, it is a trite lecture about what this author WANTS God to be like.  Parents should know that it includes a section condoning homosexual experimentation for teenage boys.   When I read a review such as: "Over the years, I have diligently sought answers to certain nagging questions ...I now have a vast library. .. finally in this book, I found the answers to life" I'm amazed. There are two possibilites, the author plugs himself as the Savior of Truth.. or it is a true review, and someone is changed to base their life, their beliefs and their religion on such a thin fictional work?   Life and Truth are worth more effort than that. The review should be ashamed to write such, to promote a book, to make a few dollars. Shame.  
 Do you know why this double CD is often in the bargain basement?  SImply because it is an inferior product.  For some very odd reason, the compiler at the record company decided to put 13 live songs instead of the studio versions that we all remember.  For all we know, it may have been a copyright problem. I bought this for my Dad about 5 years ago, but we were both unaware of the live recordings until we played it. The live recordings on this CD are dismal and not related to the awesome "Hot August Night".   Fortunately for me,  I own the right Neil Diamond CD's which contain the studio versions.  These are still available . The first is called "12 Greatest Hits" (A black and white photo a young Neil), and the second is called "12 Greatest Hits Volume 2" (a colour photo of Neil sitting on a sofa).  Both of these contain all the studio versions - and not one live recording in sight!!!    Just released is a new compilation called Neil Diamond GOLD, as part of the GOLD series but I do not know if it too contains the dreadful live recordings. All I know is that it is missing a lot of key tracks 
 This book was very disappointing. I had to force myself to finish it. The repetition begins on the third page and then beats us over the head until the end. Why a book celebrating women and their friendships has to bash men is beyond me. In writing a book contemplating death, Radish never once considers faith. Her characters are all carbon copies of one another, and the story which is supposedly about great transformations teaches us nothing except that a vacation refreshes us. Duh! Don't spend your vacation, or any of your valuable time on this one 
 Whoever wrote the editorial review sucks at writing. Also, this movie sucks 
 I thought this book would have more of an easy step by step guide for drawing.  It is more of a book for people who had have some artistic training 
 I'm a big fan of Outlaw and Texas Country, however, still album was not for me.  Hank III is too raw, too basic, and too lacking for me.  However, he does have a very unique sound and style and I can't think of anyone else out there that he sounds like.  Still I'd be cautious about buy this CD and listen to the song samples that Amazon provides 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 In answer to DesertFlower's question as to whether the Anime or the Manga came first, the answer is that the Manga was done as an adaptation of the Anime series -- in other words, the Anime was first.  I read somewhere that the manga artist(s) saw the animated version of Darcia and "couldn't wait" to draw him in the Manga, so there's a bit of provenance for you.  I agree with other posters here that an up-market, high-quality Manga treatment of "Wolf's Rain" would've done the material far more justice than the current Manga release, and would've wound up in the hands of far more consumers/fans than this current Manga edition, of which I've read nothing but horrible reviews here and elsewhere since I've been looking.  Since Bandai's box-set is only being released as of November 22nd this year (2005), perhaps Viz and Bandai and Bones and the various licensing/legal arms of all concerned could stop for a moment and realize that people expect to see all the same beauty, blood, sweat, tears and...soul...poured into the Anime to also be evident in any printed treatment.  "Wolf's Rain" deserves that.  We deserve that. You deserve that.  Do it while it's all still fresh 
 I just had to read and write a review about this book based on my niece's meeting with Sean. But first, the review.  In order not to diminish the previous reviews, I will just focus on the whole war talk. On page 4--no messing around here--Sean states, "[w]e must take the war to them, rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood." Wow, bring it on dude. Oh, you mean let's send somebody else's kid to fight, right? On page 247 he drills that point in with, "[i]'d like to see the good governor [Dean] present a case that there's any higher moral cause than defending one's innocent countrymen against terrorist attack." If it's such a great "moral cause," Sean, why oh why ain't you out there with the rest of my family? Does this, by the way, mean you are immoral since you punked out? I never thought of myself as "moral" just because I volunteered and served as a paratrooper in Vietnam. Is military service only for Democrats and brown people? Should we have a new draft catagory such as "1R" for "Republican," which means you don't have to serve?  To paraphrase Frank Purdue, it takes a tender man to spout tough talk. Page 108 puts down Democrats (I'm a Democrat who served in Vietnam, or am I repeating myself?) with, "[w]hen it comes to the Hitlers, the Brezhnevs, the Saddams, pussyfooting is the order of the day." Yeah, Sean, tell me what you really think. Well, Sean, some of us are out there strapping it on every day while you...do....what? And wasn't the Bush family in business with Hitler during WWII?  Here is really why this guy is full of himself. My niece, visiting me before heading to the Gulf and her first combat tour, spotted him in DC. She introduced herself and told him she was a fan. When she told him she was in the military he offered her a free book, saying he would ship it to her. She is very polite, and told him he didn't have to. Sean insisted. She wrote her address down. Before heading overseas, I asked her if Sean had sent the book as promised. No (and no surprise for me). So, me being me, I contacted Sean by email twice but got not reply. Too busy impressing all those other servicewomen, I guess.  Sean Hannity, not just by this book but by his actions, is a coward, blowhard, and more interested in putting the make on cute servicewomen. His book dedication to his wife means about as much as the rest of the book. You should be ashamed of yourself, Sean, but that would mean taking a "moral" position, wouldn't it?  
 This film is disappointing.  The narration is distracting and tedious.  What there is of the individual stories is interesting, but not worth suffering through endless sex education for the hopelessly ignorant. 
 The world of rock journalism is rife with shoddy writing, biased agendas, unfair ad hominem barbs, and sub-Nietzschean posturing. While this literary school has produced many noteworthy opinionated hacks, such as Robert Christgau, Albert Goldman, et al., Geoffrey Giuliano may very well be the prime exponent of this proud tradition.   Blackbird is, to put it simply, an utter waste of time, space and sorely needed trees. As some other reviewers have already mentioned, Giuliano's primary sources are disgruntled McCartney ex-employees, as well as the ex-wife of one of those ex-employees: of whom the author is apparently obsessed with, as he fawns over her incessantly in print, and has several pictures of her included. This is a little odd, as the book is ostensibly about Paul McCartney. (Giuliano also has numerous pictures of himself included in the photo spread, much to our collective indifference).    But it's one thing to produce a readable book that is filled with unreliable smear; it's quite another to produce an unreliable book that is rendered unreadable by sleazy, melodramatic prose. Giuliano is the veritable poster-child of such prose.  If you must read this, then be sure to check it out of your local public library. This book was, I think, the first McCartney bio, and accordingly most public libraries have a copy. And if you absolutely must buy this, then be sure to check out your local used-book store, as the one I shop at has about 7 copies of this tripe for sale.  
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 Just got the order of the CD from Amazon. Both the cover of the case and the cover of the CD is right: Under a Shady Tree. However, when we listen to it, it is totally different songs from different language!!! What the hell can that happen?! I don't even know if we can return it: since it is opened! But it is totally wrong songs!!! Could somebody help me here? How to contact Amazon? Thank you!! 
 HART'S WAR had potential. The last months of World War Two as a backdrop with demoralized GI's crammed into an overcrowded POW compound.  If this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge, then it could have had a chance.  Instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots.    Unintentionally the movie borrows from SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, A SOLDIER'S STORY, THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17.  A cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple.  In HART'S WAR we find some good elements lost in a virtual Mulligan stew.    In the story Colin Farrell's character, a rear echelon lawyer, accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride.  Unfortunately for Farrell, the Germans have launched their attack in the Ardennes. The young lawyer is captured, harshly interrogated, and finally shipped out to a German stalag.  There he meets the senior POW officer, played by Bruce Willis, and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a POW.  A soldier is killed and a recently downed Tuskegee airman is accused of murder.  Yes, you guessed it.  Farrell takes on the aviator's defense during the subsequent courts martial.    If director Gregory Hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged.  Instead we have additions of Colonel Hart's unexplained behavior, an mass tunnel escape plot, sabotage and the German Commandant's attempt to befriend the American lawyer as superfluous baggage.  HART'S WAR was filmed in the Czech Republic, no doubt to cut costs.   A little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office.  Still, if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this DVD to your collection 
 I was bored stiff reading this novel.  I think J. Oke needs to slow down and take some time to think between writing each book. I thought it was very unrealistic how quickly the two young ladies became friends considering they didn't speak the same language.  This action was sooooooooooooooooo slow.  I prefer Oke's more exciting books like the Canadian West series, A Woman Named Damaris, and A Gown of Spanish Lace. They aren't overly sappy and their characters do more than just hug and cry.  
 There's too much caterwauling in this one. Not for meditation, maybe as a quiet background for ambience, I dunno. It didn't quite inspire any transcendental experiences for me 
 A horrible book to introduce you to Flash and a waste of money. At the end, I really didn't understand how the program worked - only how certain tasks are done. There's a lot of fluffy chapters. A much better book is Rosanna Yeung's Flash MX 2004 Hands-On Training.   I bought this Dummies book based on the quality of other Dummies books I have, but this one was a real disappointment 
 Don't waste your time on this book, there are more valuable ones out there. First of all, what has she DONE to the fabulous story of Shahrazad? Practically torn it apart and sewed it back together with very rough stitches. I read this book trying to get away from the stereotype some writers have of typical "weak" women (I am partial to strong heroines with wit) and therefore thought another retelling of Shahrazad would be just the thing.  Well, it turned out I was wrong and this book just had the stereotype I was looking to get away from. If you want a strong heroine, if you've been disappointed by this book and how it portrays Shahrazad, go read Cameron Dokey's version (called "The Storyteller's Daughter). In all, that is a much more satisfying read 
 I've been a Sandra Brown fan for many years - and still am - however, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buy the hardback.  This was definitely not her best work.  Try your library first 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 Never has the title of a book more aptly described the content within. This tome is nothing more than the recounting of incidents in the life of a group of marginally intelligent and emotionally challenged individuals who, when faced with choices, inevitably choose the one designed to create the most disasterous results. Over and over and over again. If you are looking for happiness in the recounting of a good tale look elswhere on the bookshelf. 
 I have not received this order yet. I am contacting the supplier now 
 I just finished this book. While it paints an interesting picture about the process to bring a car to market, the style Walton employs falls short. I understand the strategy to be the naive narrator (learning with reader how things work), but she uses too many cliches and poor analogies to make her point. I don't know how many times she said "Ugly as sin" or even "It was, like," a few times. I'd recommend David Halberstam's The Reckoning or Comeback as well-written alternatives about the same subject, especially Comeback's depiction of the Mustang overhaul, than this book 
 This book should be named "Beginners Broad Overview of Mac OSX Programming Topics".  If you have never even heard of Bash/C/Python/Perl/OOP/Cocoa/Frameworks - this book may be of some use.    The first few chapters on Interface Builder/Xcode have you follow along with the simplest of instructions, creating Projects, and working with .c and .h files, and then into building and running a few simple applications. These high level concepts in themselves quite easy to grasp but the descent into actual cocoa programming/c language/frameworks/OOP in succeeding chapters is quite difficult and the authors take the same tone as many other 'how-to' books do in remaining quite technical about technically abstract concepts.   Here you will find the going quite rough, and the 'why' factor (eg, why are we doing this) is definitively absent. I can see why I have a .c file but why do I need a .h file ? The mind's natural intuition is to say "why *ever* make things more complicated then they need to be.... so why not combine the content of .c and .h files together ? The mind wonders "did the programming guru's who created XCode/IB/Cocoa/C/OOP just create a huge mess (cause thats what this looks like), or did they formulate something elegant ?" How did they arrive at this overtly complicated scheme ? Why does it have to be so complicated just to multiply a few numbers together in a small window (the Calculator tutorial from ADC).  One doesnt know when one is just starting out. There's no answer from the authors in these first few chapters, if ever. Perhaps there was some temerity at commenting 'in the margins'. This small example of a 'hey why are we doing that now ?' mental query, natural to process of learning, is just but one of many opportunities missed. Granted, nobody said programming was easy, but imparting an understanding being the ostensible goal of how-to books, the audience is definitely looking for clues about 'why' and not just the 'how'.  As a result of so many omissions, grasping the 'why' of it all is decidedly difficult. The book if it were to be improved would need to dig into this 'why' aspect much more deeply than it now does. Am I learning a big huge mess, that nobody has ever bothered to truly rethink/streamline or does this XCode/IB/Cocoa stuff combine into something truly efficient ? If its efficient, show me why, Im here to learn and want to know...  The languages chapters do a reasonable job of explaining to the never-heard-of-it-before audience the concepts of Bash, C, Perl, Python, and Applescript. The book provides decent examples and discussions as to their various capabilities and pro's and con's. The book also provides many "now you do it" type functions and you will find yourself wanting to launch a Terminal session and get going right away.  The book does not necessarily bode well for the programming novice at "rung 2 or 3" who already has some knowledge of broad topics and wants to actually learn the how-to of programming- which would quite naturally be Cocoa, since Cocoa is the basis for all modern Mac programs that run with any GUI at final output. Unfortunately,  I could only weakly recommend OReilly's "Learning Cocoa", itself quite technical and also very much missing the 'guide voice' or 'why factor'.   Because I feel the 'why factor' and the 'voice of the guide' were so notably absent from this tome, Im only giving it 2 of 5 stars, there's lots of room for improvement imho. I also despise when authors provide aliases to explanations found on the internet...and this tome is also guilty of this phenomena. Hey, I paid for your book, *I expect a decent explanation* not a link to a website where I could read with little understanding until my eyeballs fall out 
 I tried to read this after I read "52 Fights" and was very dissapointed.  TMMG reads like a silly teenage magazine or Cosmo -- Maybe the "Samanta Jones" take but with juvenile lingo.  It's really self-centered and offers no concrete advice or insight.  It also has stupid lines in it like keeping your option open to pose for Playboy.  Huh?  A waste of time and money.  If this is your thing, you can find it free on any number of websites and blogs.  "52 Fights" was much better 
 Reality Bites seemed fresh when it was first released, giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of "X" - that was overeducated, underemployed, plagued by the flashy, trashy commercialism of MTV, and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college.    It was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass, cruel arena of materialism can be tough, providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth - the very stuff of real movies.  Instead we have a swan dive into a Pizza Hut commercial held together by a plot so shop-worn it would have been considered exhausted in 1930.  Winona Ryder is winning as Lelaina, but one can only imagine the SATs of football players at a college where she is valedictorian.  Her "documentary" is appallingly narcissistic, reflecting the characteristic Gen X notion that - "if it's about me, it's art, and it's important."  Ethan Hawke does an excellent job as Troy, the very archetype of self-satisfied, supercilious entitlement.  We are expected to root for him, but it's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus.  Stiller, who directed - a talented fellow almost impossible to look at - plays Michael, the "anti-Troy."  Smooth, successful, and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of Gen X culture - if culture is the right word - he's an executive at an MTV-ish corporation.  That he improves Lelaina's preposterous "documentary," rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity, is the film's dirty little secret.  Viewers surprised by who wins Lelaina's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and Liberace was gay.  Indeed, when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie.  Janeane Garofalo is outstanding as always, and John Mahoney shines as the TV morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact, a bastard.  His performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film - or on TV - than the rest of this film put together.  In fact, reality is great, this picture would have benefited from some 
 This Cd I feel is too long. I can't stand Foreigner anymore, they used to be great. Awful edits like Urgent, Jukebox Hero, & Waiting for a Girl Like You have to be changed. And that boring ballad, what is it?????? I Want to Know What Love Is....Irritating for 2 minutes. And that singer, he kind of raises his voice too much. Not one of the best bands I have ever heard. Other irritating songs are HEADKNOCKER, Blue Morning, & Head games and they kinda suck. They just give me on my nerves. This is noise.....buy any album from Dire Straits insted. Dire Straits are the best..................................... 
 Saccharine cotton candy.  About the only "real" thing left from the folk tales is Babe being found during a blue snow and staying blue. My grandkids' great great grandparents came from a logging past.  Am I going to use this book to introduce them to heir own history?  Absolutely not 
 Nine inch nails are the only band on this cd worth listening to, this sound track is crap 
 It is a great concept, but mine kept filling with water and then getting an error so my cats never had a chance to use it.  I tried all of the stuff to get the errors to stop but i never had it go a whole cycle without getting an error.  I would definately be worth the money if it would work correctly 
 In fairness this is a guide to literary agents.  No doubt.  The catch is the premise that from this book one can pitch his or her's manuscript. Well the pitch can be made but it will not be read.  You will get your response with a dear john "your project" card.  (They cannot even find the time to write down the title of your book.)  Why is this?  Why do the agents allow their names' and adresses' in these books.  It's vanity, all vanity.  Now they have a new gimmick.  It's advice.  "I'm too busy, have too many clients anyhow, have you tried Writer's Market???  That's the kiss off.  Er, please never send me anything again.  A few will actually mention that the three chapters that they requested in their advertising blurb and you sent them were disposed of unread.  So what to do?  Call them up.  Call'em.  Find out if they want to read your stuff or not.  Better yet get on a program of meeting agents and editors.  This is all about money, not creativity.  Maybe you can bribe a credible editor  (not an agent) to read your work. (I know everybody tells you not to do this.) Sometimes you have to succomb to extream measures.  You're a creator, be creative. But save your copying dough and your envelopes and the postage and the time and give these agents a call.  If they don't have time to take your call they certainly dont have time to read your stuff.  Be tough.            
 The product details on Amazon say that this DVD has soundtracks in both English and in Japanese with English subtitles.  There is NO Japanese version on this DVD, only English 
 I can't wait until Michael puts out Motown Three, so then I can hear more half-hearted, unoriginal covers playing on my work radio! I'm biting my tongue to keep from swearing, but this man deserves every profane word I can imagine! Michael McDonald's voice is not good! In fact, it is on par with a karaoke night! The brown-eyed soul man needs to stop being so full of himself, and if anything, write a song of his own again! There's nothing I love more than seeing washed up 70's artists like Michael McDonald and Rod Stewart recycle old songs and push them on the contemporary mainstream! Thank you for making my ears bleed, Michael 
 Did that person actually read this book?   Green Melusine and I must be kindred spirits - I came here intending to make EXACTLY the same points! First of all, reading the back cover was what made up my mind to buy this book. It sounded like a fun and funny read about a young woman who tries to change her life and personality after she catches her boyfriend cheating on her. Instead, she spends the rest of the book whining and starting even more dysfunctional relationships, one after the other. Trina does not change or develop AT ALL, and that was disappointing.   Most disturbing, however, was the overall message. I don't know what points the author wanted to get across, but it seemed to me that she spent most of the book complaining that the outlook is grim for single women in their thirties - the only available guys are into disturbing sex games, or they have STDs. The moral of the story was that it's better to return to the guy who cheats on you (hey! He SAID he wouldn't do it again!) than to develop a shred of self esteem and show him the door, since the pickings are so slim. WHAT?  Despite the annoying protagonist and infuriating ending, I'm giving White Bikini Panties two stars, since it's fairly well written and there are some interesting moments (while I was sick of Trina by the book's end, I found myself absorbed by the subplot involving her older sister Jessie, and Jessie's struggle with infertility. Although it is also implied that Jessie can do no better than to settle for a cheating husband... hmmm...) If you really NEED another light chick lit read, this one will pass the time. However, if you're like me and your shelves are overflowing with this kind of book, don't bother adding this to the collection.   
 This book was extremely BASIC.  Hardly any useful information at all.  If you have ever taken out a mortgage, you already know most of this.  It was almost a total waste of money.  The main focus of this book is to sell you a much more expensive program(s) 
 As of 3/9/07 these new filters (w/out the life indicator) do NOT fit in the water cooler (they do fit other Pur Products).  If you call Pur (1.800.Pur.Line) and tell them your situation with the cooler, they will send you a replacement until the solution (new filter) is released since the standard ones (with the life indicator) are discontinued. They were trying to make a good percent of their coolers, dispensers, & pitchers use only one type of filter rather than have multiple filters.  There was a mistake on their part and if you call them, they are very nice and trying to fix the problem as soon as possible.  
 I bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues. Note: Amazon seems to spread these reviews across DVDs of the same title, so you may see this review under multiple DVD releases of "Meet John Doe".  The poor quality DVD that I bought has a cover that looked like this: [... 
 Black is not black, it has a dark brown reflex on it. It does not look good on. I have plenty of tees and this is the worst. It looks bigger than what the label says. For what you get this is pretty expensive. I bought this from Foot locker. I find shipping and handling prices ridiculously high when you buy only a t-shirt. Eastbay and some other sport apparel companies charge the same. It is ridiculous. Just do not buy 
 This is what happens when great authors go to seed. It seems like a cruel mockery of a Greene novel, parading the same old themes around, corrupted more than ever by an unjustified excess liberalism. There isn't a single living character here, and even though the prose is generally competent, I think it has to be buried in consideration of the man's memory 
  The book is beautiful, no doubt. The figures and summury tables are great. However, the book lacked clarity (in my opinion at least). Comparing it to books like Lathi's Modern Communication Systems and Dorf's Modern Control Systems, it really fails in motivating the equations and mathematical derivations. Lots of very important formulas and conclusions just seem to pop-up.   Most of the excersises were also very difficult to understand in light of the given information in the text.  I recall reading the never-ending pages in the physics of BJTs with hardly a clue to what really was going on. Most of the other students merely jumped to the modeled equations  and didn't bother at all with the underlying physics.  To be fare though I must say I didn't read any other book on general electronics (we moved on to specialized courses in intstrumentation)so the book might be a lot better then others 
 Maybe its the beginners bible and not the holy bible size they were talking about.  This book is for beginners only!!  The main part of this book is recipes.  If I wanted that I would have bought a recipe book not a book to teach me about diabetes nutrition.  This is not a complete anything!!!  Try Prevention The Sugar Solution.  I am returning the "bible".  What a waste of my money having to return this book.  Not sure why it has so many stars 
 Let me start out by being fair - if you know a lot about Indian history/culture this book MAY interest you even if the first 50 pgs. are excruciatingly slow. Otherwise, you will have a hard time understanding the value behind what the characters do. The whole plot revolves around the woman's place in Indian society & more specifically, Bimla's conflict with her brother, Raja. The conflict seems to begin resolving itself in the last 15 pgs, but the author does not take the time to write out the final scene between sister & brother. Very difficult book to enjoy with no satisfactory conclusion 
 Sometimes when I can't get into a book at first, I hang in there thinking that I'll get hooked in soon.  Usually that happens, but unfortunately, it did not in this case.  The book centers on an Irish family in the early -  mid 1900's, three generations, their motivations, the love they did/didn't  receive from their parents, their sagas.  Yet, I could not connect with any  of the characters, and could barely recall who was who and what had  happened from one reading to the next.  I loved Mary Gordon's book,  Spending.  When I read a book and enjoy it, I will read and study other  books by the same author.  I was very disappointed in this book 
 This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb."  When she stays focused on the story of Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of "A Moveable Feast."  But the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America, share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in the title).   It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man 
 This product was very interesting and informative.  Difficult to follow detox rules are made much easier with this product that breaks down each stage and day into an easy to follow cue card format.  A lot of info is consisely written into a cue card format 
 There is actually a lot of interesting historical information for the right-of-center reader who wants to learn about the right-wing/Republican successes in bolstering its face time in the American media.   But it's a tough read because Brock is obviously extremely skeptical of pretty much everything that comes out of the mouth of anyone who votes Republican.   Brock hurts his credibility early on when he states flat out that his early conservative writings were actually literary regurgitations of the right wing party line. But what's to keep a reader from viewing this book as just a left-wing version of the same?  I think he could have balanced the book by discussing more specific left-of-center successes. Whenever he does mention the left-wing in the media, it's usually in lofty platitudes about their objectivity and non-partisanship (trust me, Brock really believes this).   He seems to think the left-wing is totally helpless in the face of the right-wing media juggernaut. Does anyone in America actually believe that?  This book has the potential to be an informative read (it's over 400 pages), but it too often lapses into name calling, unsubstantiated generalizations, and conspiratorial excess.   Leave the wild rhetoric to Michael Moore and just give us the facts 
 Julia Glass buried her finely designed characters in excessive, useless words.  A discard.  Not National Book Award Material 
 Sorry, I'm more of an action viewer. It broke my heart to hear the Gettysburg address and not see any of the battle. The series teases you by placing the setting in Gettysburg, yet no emphasis was place on one of the most historic battles in American history. Stick to Ted Turner's "Gettysburg" if you like action 
 My 5 and 3 year olds didn't seem to be too troubled by this book, but I found it dark and disturbing.  What starts out as a seemingly typical children's story takes a sudden and scary turn.  I have to think that the only reason they weren't more scared is that they are too young to know anything about World War II and the death camps.  But even without that metaphor, the illustrations are disturbing in themselves.  Skulls, razor wire, dark figures... it's just not what I consider appropriate for a children's book.  The "magic pencil" story could easily have been told with less threatening villians and more age-appropriate illustrations.  I found myself searching the book's dust jacket for why on earth the author would choose to create a book like this for young children 
 Brian Hinton's Both Sides Now is a complete disaster.  What could have been a promising biography of Mitchell is instead a garbled mess.  Indeed, Hinton's text is relatively void of biographical information.  Rather,  Hinton relies on a handfull of interviews published of Mitchell's, and he  quotes from them in such large chunks that the reader would be the wiser to  check out the interviews from their sources.  Following a brief, and  flawed, biographical section, Hinton uses the rest of the text as a forum  for his interpretations of Mitchell's work.  Album by album, song by song,  Hinton gives his own personal commentary on Mitchell's music so that the  text ends up reading like a diary of Hinton's own personal reflections.   Moreover, Hinton's analysis of Mitchell's songs are sometimes so off-base  and confusing that the reader is left wondering how he comes to these  conclusions.  Finally, his constant personal comments in the text make it  seen like nothing more than a high school writing assignment 
 I think this novel is best for younger readers.  I found it a little cheesy.  I stopped reading it after 60 pages because the comic strips got annoying and it could not hold my attention.  
 What? They aren't the best rock band in the world. The only rock songs that rock are Start Me Up and Shattered. What's the point? They used to play punk back in the 60's. They were never the best rock band in the world. Or maybe they are, they are a great band but they are way better than the Who. The Beatles suck 
 I have to admit it.  This book left me scratching my head wondering exactly what the other reviewers saw in it.      The Story:  The koalas at the zoo have become disenchanted with one another.  No one remembers why, but the end result is that they are not speaking to one another.  The wisest koala decides that if they have a great costume ball that all will again become copacetic.   Well, the rest of the less-wise koalas love the idea.  They soon gather in their many costumes and dance their many dances.  At sundown, they happily obey the suggestion of the wise old Koala to take their costumes off.   (The wise old koala believes that once the costumes are off that they will behave more civilly.)   So what happens?    It turns out all the anger isn't gone.   Despite having such a fine party, the bears can't let go of their crankiness because they can't tell who is who.  We are told by the author that "Koala bears are famous for looking very much alike...." and so  they go back to being angry.  The Hunting Bear didn't know the Nurse Bear.  The Indian Bear didn't know the Chinese Bear.  They started to get angry all over again and some low growling  was heard.  The wise old bear is not flummoxed by this turn of events.  Mustering up his wisdom, he suggests they all put their costumes back on and go on with the dance.  This they do and the Koala's dance the night away.  And   The next day, it turns out that the bears had such a good time that they decide to wear parts of their costumes... and so [drum roll] they learn to differentiate themselves once again.  And... the book concludes with: "He scratched his head and thought:  "From now on, in Koala Park, there must be many, many more BEAR PARTIES!"  Huh?  Perhaps the point is that we need differences to get along.  Or perhaps there is no point.  [Or perhaps I could be more creative about finding one if I had more sleep and more coffee.]    I can only explain the Caldecott Honor by way of the 1951 publication date.  The 50's are not particularly well know for great children's writing.  But then again... the other 2 reviewers seem to love this book.  In any case, hope this helps.  TwoStars.  Intriguing artwork.  Story leaves this mom feeling like years of college were wasted.  And if the point is this hard for an adult to grasp, what chance have young children got 
 When used in the music industry, the term rebirth would indicate erasing the slate and starting anew, and presenting yourself as something different.  Perhaps Jennifer Lopez thought of this knowing that her singing career was in decline, and opted to give her fourth album the title Rebirth.  Is there any legitimate sign of a rebirth on this album, you ask?   A few songs in, and the answer is clearly no.  The songs are still built on synthetic arrangements with synths and samples where real instruments could be, the lyrics are still some of the most shallow you'll ever hear, Lopez still isn't doing much in the way of writing, and her thin voice still sounds the same way it did on her first album.  You would think by now that with all the time that Lopez has spent as a recording artist that some aspects of her output would have improved, but that is not the case.  If the Lopez faithful (who made her first two albums multi-platinum hits) need any proof how weak her voice is, listen to some of the songs here, including the single "Get Right" - she TALKS her way through a lot of these tracks.  That's right, not singing or rapping, but talking.  You have to hear them to know what I mean.  Did you ever stop to think that she doesn't perform live because she can't sing a note in tune?  One thing I'll give her credit for is that at least she isn't taking advantage of her fans by performing "live" concerts while miming the whole thing (like those hacks Britney Spears and Hilary Duff).  The material is so weak that it's little wonder why her fan base has eroded as of late, despite her high profile.  In summary: Not being true to its title, Rebirth is instead a continuation of the weak bubblegum pop and lite R&B sounds that we've come to expect from Jennifer Lopez.  In short, expect more studio-enhanced singing, more synthetic music and more lyrics so weak that even Black Eyed Peas would have rejected them.  You can definitely do better than this album - just don't expect to hear it on the "hit music" station 
 What a disgusting stupid movie. I saw this when i was just a kid. and news flash drew barrymore doesnt look like that anymore. Not trying to be rude, but what the hell is wrong with that girls chin? It grew over the years, because she looked fine in bad girls this movie, and i think boys on the side, but movies like never been kissed, and at the end of charlie's angels full throttle, all you can see when you look at her face is that huge white chin, like a jay leno chin. reminds me of the moon man from mcdonalds... with the huge chin that sticks way out. it's a cruel fact of what time does to our looks, when you get older you arent as pretty as you use to be, but i never thought chins grew bigger, in her early years her chin was of normal size now it looks huge and deformed. AS for this movie, not sexy at all, unless you find a backstabbing, murdering, lying, crazy ass teenage girl ..... sexy? Maybe men would like it, because all it has is sex scenes. only for shallow people who get excited when it comes to "that fantasy" of a much older man having sex with a teenage girl, and he's old enough to be her father. I dont find it sexy at all, it just wasn't believable in any way shape or form. A complete waste of time, money, and talent. Flat out garbage. thumbs down 
 I stumbled upon Jack Stewart, have read several of his books and thoroughly enjoyed them.  As I'm reading Hurricane, I keep getting the feeling I've read it before, knowing that I haven't.  After a little research, yes I have read it before it was named Diamond Sky - the names have changed (a little) and instead of cocaine it was diamonds, but the plot is exactly the same.  Come on Mr. Stewart. . .you can do better than that 
 I found the content of this book to be completely appalling.  To me, the book suggested ways to "manipulate" your spouse by couching it in terms of "salting" to get what you want.  Shameful.  There are too many other books available to help strengthen marriages without learning to manipulate your spouse.  I would never recommend this book to anyone.  If you want a good book to help strengthen a marriage, try "What Every Woman Desires" instead 
 I'd never heard of Mosley before I picked up (t)his book @ the library.  My first warning of the bias to come was that its dedicated to Danny Glover, who has taken the ultra-liberal stance of loons claiming America "deserved" 9/11.    I read eight of the nine stories; two were character-driven and excellent, the rest were passable.    Futureland takes place around 2030.  There is no privacy.  Citizens are monitored at all times, or can be as needed.  Corporations run the government; a software titan, quite mad, runs a great deal of the world from an island called Home (he's nothing like Bill Gates).  A permanent, official underclass of Unemployed--including those prevented from working if they disobey company rules--sits under New York. Offshore corporate prisons house inmates completely stripped of their citizenship.  Cloning is well out of its infancy with all the attendant promises and horrors to come.  A drug called Pulse, which creates ultra-real fantasies and illusions but is virtually guaranteed to kill its users by collapsing their brain tissues, is legal.  And the World's Greatest Boxer is a 6'9" coffee-skinned woman.    In this fascinating yet unlikely world Mosley weaves his tales.  Sometimes the prose is shaky, and I disliked the way the overt (and unlikely) racism is portrayed with a chip on the author's shoulder.  Mosley, who is black (and unsmiling in the jacket photo) seems to have it in for Whites, but compared to the Mosleyverse, the amount of real world power Whites wield, now and in the future, is shrinking along with the worldwide White population; by 2030 Whites will be a tiny minority (and globally, already are).  There's not a single Hispanic in the book, and they're the fastest-growing American minority!    I can't understand how an otherwise skilled author, easily capable of illustrating the monstrousness of gigantic and abusive governments, doesn't realize that free markets are what bring people out of poverty; nothing else.  Hope you eventually come out of the communist fog you're in, M Mosley.  Post-script:  I agree with the reviewers who suggest Futureland should've been a novel and not a collection of stories.  Word to your mother 
 As a serious student of the Kennedy assassination I have read many theories of what happened that day in Dallas. As a high school student in the mid-seventies, I saw the Zapruder film on the Geraldo Rivera broadcast and was sure there was a conspiracy. I read all the information at the time and was hooked. Yet, after some time, I realized that almost all of the information was pro-conspiracy, full of ideas and claims, but short on evidence. By the time the eighties came along, with a generation of time, the theories got wilder in order to keep interest. If you don't like the evidence, just claim that it's faked. The autopsy photos? The President's body? What's next? Well, James Fetzer has hit a new low now claiming the Zapruder film has been altered. When I saw this book, I could not put it down. In order to keep the conspiracy cash register going, a few Professors with obviously too much time on their hands have come up with another ridiculous conspiracy theory that must make the earlier conspiracy buffs (who had legitimate beefs with various issues such as the rushed Warren Report and the incomplete autopsy) wince since their search for the truth has become a money-making bonanza. What could be next? The Babushka Lady with a machine-gun? Jack Ruby in the follow-up car? This theory has more assassins and firing angles than buildings surrounding  Dealey Plaza. Thank goodness for authors like Gerald Posner, who back their claims with solid evidence, or Richard Trask, who presents an refreshing book about the assassination without an agenda to prove. Buy this book only for the entertainment value to see how low the conspiracy buffs have gone, or for the interesting use of the assassination photos.   
 I had the entire story figured out by about page 10 and I'm not usually very good at guessing plots. This was extremely predictable. The characters were okay, but not great. The little girl, Bernadette, is by far the best character in the book.  Not really worth the time or money to read 
 This one time, I shot myself in the brain. Twice. It made me quite a bit stupider than I used to be, but it was NOTHING compared to reading this book. Do not ever buy "Math Stuff". If you have to read it for school, drop out. Seriously. I read the first 40ish pages, and at some times it seemed like the author had drooled on her keyoard without realizing it and the resultant short circuits inserted a bunch of random letters. After spell check fixed them into English words, a publisher took pity on the poor retarded woman and printed up a few copies, one of which had the misfortune to drop into my math teacher's hands. I am currently writing a report on this repulsive turd of a book, and I want to find a small defenseless furry animal to kick in the ribs 
 I've read several Bentley Little books although why, i'm not sure.  I can't say for sure if this one or the one about the postman was worse, but either way, i have given up reading anything he writes.  If i could rate this book with less than one star, i would.  I picture the first seventy-five percent of this book written at his leisure, with very little interest other than for the money he would make when it got published.  The last twenty-five percent of the book, the finale, seemed rushed and contrived, written in a flash because his dead line was quickly approaching.  If a writer is going to write, he should have the decency to at least try his best.  And if a publisher is going to publish, he should have enough respect not to insult readers with this kind of garbage 
 I was looking forward to using this cookbook as the idea of preparing dinner early in the day and having it ready and waiting for me at six o'clock was extremely appealing.  However, I have been extremely disappointed.  All the entrees I have tried have been, in my opinion, overcooked.  Sadly, I am coming to the conclusion that most foods were not meant to be cooked 6-7 hours.  Most of the recipes I tried were a bland mushy mess and there is not one that I would subject my family to again.  My last and final attempt was the Chicken with Beer which was both dry (due to the required baking for 20 minutes in the oven after 3 to 4 hours in the slow cooker on high) and tasteless.  Much to my amazement, one prior reviewer actually liked this recipe!  So maybe its just me.  In any case I am considering givin the slow cooker to Goodwill, along with this cookbook.  There has got to be a better way to simplify the chaos of dinner time preparation 
 I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months, and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere.  Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy!  So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up! 
 I purchased these cans hoping the ney sayers were extreme audiophiles, and the praisers were average people. Turns out the ney sayers were average people like me. These Headphones have ZERO BASS, none. I love bass, I have had 15 + pairs of headphones, some of them $15-$20 dollars that have better bass. I thought maybe these might just have a nice clean sound un-poluted by heavy bass, I  would rather have a pair of tweeters on my ears. They look so good though, I actually took a decent pair of headphones and put the speakers from those in the Skull Candies. Let me tell you, it's the design of the cup, they made the good speakers sound like dooky. So if you want somthing that looks great around your neck, like jewlery, get these. If you want good headphones, get a pair of sennheisers(SP?). They have affordable stuff that sounds great 
 I had to read this book because of a school project. This was a terrible book. I hated it from the beginning because it had no plot, story line, or good characters. About halfway through the book, one of the main characters, Mando, just left. it didn't say where or why he left, but Scott O'Dell didn't bring him back in the book. I am a little glad because Mando was just a pain. But unfortuanatly, Zia stayed. She was in every scene and was very boring. If anyone wants to read it, then i hope this helps you... THROW IT AWAY!! 
 Although the "technical data" said this pot is safe for the stovetop, when it arrived, its own literature said very clearly that it is NOT safe for stovetop use. The only reason I ordered it was because I wanted something I could move from stovetop to oven or broiler. THis is very disappointing 
 XML is changing at a lightning fast pace, and this 2000 book is already out of date 
 This book's topic lends itself to a desultory journal article. My graduate seminar professor insisted that we read the book, and I was a dutiful soldier.  Having read it, I can only say that it seems to me to be far less interesting/illuminating than he supposed.  The last thirty years have witnessed the appearance of a profusion of books about obscure people, and reading this one will remind you why it was that those people's stories formerly were obscure 
 Churchill is one of the most amazing figures of the last century - yet with all of his background to pick from, this book doesn't present much of him.  This is basically the author sort of randomly meandering around through Churchill's life and then stating his opinion of certain decisions Churchill made. And it's done without providing much of a framework for the various events he discusses. I've read a lot about Churchill and yet I was lost at times trying to figure out where/what/when on some of the events.  There is a lot better out there (William Manchester's 2 volumes for example) 
 Kal Penn is cool and I dig some of his work,but this film is very weak. I dig the T&A element,but the storyline and lack of Humor bored me.  it was only just ok at best. i expected a little something that would crack me up. I knew it was gonna be just kinda there,but it didn't even really go to being anything but just ok 
 I keep reading Paul Auster's novels for no other reason than to see how he's repackaged his old material (material that was great in the NY3 and Moon Palace and The Music of Chance).  His last 5 novels cover no new ground, and The Brooklyn Follies, with the exception of the downright stupid Timbuktu, is perhaps the worst of them.  Like Auster's never written about characters who've given up on life before, and persist for whatever reason a coincidence propels them into.  Chance, overly symbolic names, mannered writing, cliches, literature essays masquerading as prose dialogue or narrative ... we GET IT, Paul!  You like Kafka, Beckett, Cervantes, Hawthorne, Whitman, Melville, and a bunch of esoteric European poets, et al.  We get it.  Stop.  Please.  Try something new.  And has Auster ever had a protagonist or central character who wasn't either a writer, a wannebe writer, an artist, a wannabe artist, or just an existential avatar, a living ghost?  Yeah, Nathan Glass is a retired insurance man.  Sure.  It's not even close to being believable if you've read all of Auster's novels, b/c it's clear his world is so myopic that the only people he can write about are writers or living ghosts - people like himself.  I'm not sure Auster's even writing his novels anymore.  It's as if The Brooklyn Follies is his confession.  Just as his character, Harry Brightman, worked the art scam, selling replicas of previous successful works, Auster (who is creatively dead) and his publishers seem to be perpetuating the same kind of scam.     
 Although the title claims to be objective by purporting to be a "true" story, it is extremely apparent that the author wrote the book with an agenda in mind.  This book will most likely be popular among conspiracy theorist and left wing radicals who will readily believe the worst about their government - especially with a Republican as a President.  Not worth the money it's printed on 
 As many of the reviews have all ready said, this is a pretty one-side book with not much research and certainly not reality for most schools.   I am not an advocate for teachers assigning any homework outside of special projects and research, etc...  My experience as a school administrator is that schools do not assign a lot of homework, even at the secondary level.  The problem is, students goof off in school and don't do the class work in the time given in class.  They then go home and complain about homework, which are assignments that should have been done in class.    I'm sure that there are teachers who do give excessive amounts of homework but I have encountered very few who want to fight that fight with parents and students.  The real problem is a lack of motivation by some students (my own children included) who don't do the assignments and fall behind and forever struggle to catch up.    If either of these authors were in education they would have picked up on this, but then they would have lost their soap box.  My fear is that they will keep some parents from the reality of the situation 
 Shaw, who more than any of his contemporaries dealt provocatively with the crucial issues of his day, has not worn well.  In a 1971 encyclopaedia I had as a child, the entry on GBS called him the greatest dramatist since  Shakespeare.  That's better than Moliere, Sheridan, Strindberg, Ibsen,  Wilde, Jarry, Chekhov, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett!  Such a laughable  proposition is untenable today, and we can now see Shaw for what he is - a  superficially amusing farceur, who squandered this modest gift on deadly  social comment, deadly because he reduced issues that effected real people  to theorems, and reduced those people to mere mouthpieces.  There is no  subtext in Shaw - everything is expounded tediously and teeth-grindingly on  the surface.   ARMS AND THE MAN is one of his better efforts, and, after an  uncertain start, settles into some nice old-style farce - hidden  identities, buffoonish heroes, scheming servants, crusty old majors; when,  though, the puppets start lecturing us on war, idealism, class, gender  etc., one's heart sinks, not because what Shaw says isn't true, but because  a letter to the Times would have been a better place to say it.  While  Wilde's plays grow with the years, seeming richer, more meaningful,  brutally satiric, bursting with complex and fluid themes, Shaw's work, in  their steadfast refusal of mystery and ambiguity, seem chilly and remote 
 By "it" I mean the evil monster called "Repetition". It may sound like a strange thing to say, but if you already own Doyle's "Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire", there's absolutely no reason whatsoever to buy this soundtrack.   The film feels like you've seen it a thousand times already, and so does the score. I can't stress enough how much I dislike the habit of many composers to develop a specific sound and a certain set of themes and motifs, and ride them out until the end of days. That being said, it's not a big reach saying that Goblet Of Fire and Eragon sound exactly the same. And they do. The orchestrations couldn't be more identical, and the theme is the same, even if Doyle adds a few flourishes.  It may fit the film somehow, but if you forget that for a second and evaluate the music as an entry in the long history book of film music, or even in the not-so-long book of the last few years, or worse, as a standalone piece, it's just a horrible product, it's Patrick Doyle on autopilot. And even if it does fit the film, there's more to a great film score than capturing a scene reasonably well. A great film score gives the film a unique feeling, and Eragon doesn't do that. Instead of writing an "Eragon" score, Doyle churned out a Patrick Doyle score. Sound crazy, but that's the big difference between good film composers and great film composers.  And contrary to the opinion of many, Doyle is merely a good composer, and so we get a Doyle score with Eragon fingerprints instead of Eragon music with Patrick Doyle fingerprints.  
 Suddenly, everyone is condemning America. Rock 'n Rollers, writers, artists, actors and actresses, foreign dignitaries. They're all pointing their finely manicured fingers at us "vulgar" Americans warning us about our "decadent" lifestyles and "hegemony." We're too fat, too materialistic, too self-centered, too violent, too pushy, they decry. And this, they insist, is why the world hates us. But first it warrants asking: are all theses stereotypes true? Are we Americans really that horrible? Where are the facts to prove it?  Leftist author Mark Hertsgaard in his book "The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World" doesn't attempt to answer these questions. Instead, his aim is to perpetuate the anti-American stereotype, to exonerate and explain away those who hate us. One of the most mind-boggling parts of Hertsgaard's book is when he attempts to extol African culture over American culture (which part of that vast continent he extols he does not make clear). The Africans, he insists, lead a far more relaxed, casual lifestyle than our own frenzied one. Americans are too greedy and pushy and violent. If only we could be more like the Africans, the world would love us, and peace would reign over the land.  Statistics show, however, that Americans are rather laid-back, moreso than even those precious Europeans. The Swiss, for example, are more concerned with time than the average American. And as far as being violent, once again statistics show that Americans are less violent than even the saintly Canadians. But the Left never allows for facts and figures to interfere with its arguments. So instead, Hertsgaard praises Africa's primitive ways, which, to him, are more idyllic. Once again ignoring data, he fails to acknowledge Africa's AIDS crisis, genocide, female mutilation, mass starvation, tyranny, ethnic warfare and average lifespan of about 46 years.     Leftists like Hertsgaard who bash America on all levels while praising the most war-torn, impoverished societies on earth make clear their intentions. The world, Hertsgaard argues, should not rest until America is brought down to its level. In Hertsgaard's religion of socialism, America is the devil, and anyone who hates the devil is level-headed and rational. If only we stupid Americans would wake up, and realize how much better off we'd be if we succumb to the world's hatred and allow ourselves to lead the lives of those innocent Africans, with their baskets on top their heads, quaint huts made of straw, and their machetes, tyrants, starvation, and early death... 
 This book is appalling. It is disempowering to women, providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births (with no reference to back it up), and generally gives a "don't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you" attitude--even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby.   In spite of what this book says, there are things you can do to minimize tearing (and episiotomies don't heal better than tears, in spite of what the book says), things you can do to improve your chances of a healthy baby without a cesarean or other medical interventions, and so on. Of course there are times these things are needed, but not nearly so often as the book suggests, and it's not nearly so random. It continually cites opinions as facts, without any evidence base.  There are much, much better books out there than this one. Don't subject yourself to the needless anxiety of this book 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc.  That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT "DL" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT "DL" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO?  Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory .. 
 Very dissapointed in the quality of this VHS tape.This third installment does not measure up to the first two. Production values very poor.It looks as if the copy I received was made from a copy, picture was not clear and sound was terrible. I am sending this tape back 
 The first year or so, the characters made me think being 13 would really be this simple and fun. Reality set in pretty fast, however. Ann Martin lightly tiptoes around subjects like disabilites, absentee parents, and divorce. As a child of divorce from the age of five on, I found the butter-smooth TV-sitcom resolutions of (I think) two characters' parental break-ups downright insulting, even at my young age at the time.   Ms. Martin, you are doing girls no favors with this one-dimensional cotton-candy fantasy teenage world, written only for cold hard cash. How many are there now, 500+? Speaking of which,  my mother bought a second copy of the first 1986 printing of BSC #1 and still has it sealed in plastic like a mint-condition comic book. Maybe in 40 or so years, or after Ms. Martin kicks the bucket, whatever comes first, it'll be worth a little $$ for us. Just food for thought. 
 Im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.  After picking up Illustrator however, Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers.  Ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people: those who "get" vector graphic programs, and those who errrr...dont. Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I fall into the later category. I dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course. This decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts to me. (Indeed, defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science!) So my advice is this: Be extremely carefull if youve never used Illustrator before. It may be a breeze to those well versed in its use, but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it.   
 The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him.  BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit. 
 Although this book would appear to have a lot of promise, it ultimately fails. Like Mr. Taylor's self-proclaimed "Certified Professional Landlord" title (Fill in your name on page 218 for your own bogus certification!), these phony forms are imaginative but have little to no legal standing. Worse, Taylor apparently has little respect for his tenants. One form, the "Tenant Late Rent Warning and Excuses" form ("To be given to new, renewing, and late tenants.") asks tenants to mark a box as to why their rent was late. Sample excuses: I was mugged. "You didn't come by when I had the money," "I didn't have a stamp," "I'm dead." A chuckle for a landlord, but also a cynical and unprofessional suggestion. Taylor's advice on handling phone calls from prospective residents is even worse - he promotes using a hard-sell interrogation on the first contact that seems destined to drive away prospective tenants. Anyone with intentions to do good business would be well served to get more professional advice than this extremely disappointing book 
 I bought this item to protect my new Motorola L6.  First of all, it's a cheap piece of plastic... would break if dropped. Second, and more important, MY PHONE DOESN'T WORK WITH IT ON! The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone, preventing any usage of the entire phone.  BEWARE... DON'T BUY 
 Other reviews have stated negatives about this book which explains much of why it doesn't work. There are no photos, nothing enlightening - nothing unique unless the reader doesn't know who Hugh Hefner is or what he's been doing for decades. Any compassion initially felt for the author as a child becomes overshadowed by her focus on shallow sensationlism.  She clearly still has a love-hate problem going with "Hef", her parents, herself, her sister. The gist of the story is told in the first few chapters and what follows is indulgent reminiscing where one wishes the author had, instead, invested even half as much time in improving her writing style as she does in focusing on clothing labels.  The complaining and finger pointing got exasperating. It's a book that shouldn't have been written because the author didn't really commit herself to a true expose' or personal growth. Not that the reader can see anyway 
 I am soooo tired of Danielle Steel's books. They have lost all of the originality with which she used to write. Every book now has the same story line just different names for the characters. BORING!  What happened to the good stuff - Thurston House, Ghost, Kaliedescope ........    I had stopped reading her books because I have been sick of the same old thing - I borrowed Miracle from a friend hoping it would indeed be a miracle and would be original Danielle Steel -I was completely wrong. I would guess her writing is suffering because she pumps out 2 to 3 books a year. Danielle if you are reading this (and I hope she is) PLEASE give us back something great to read - Quality instead of Quantity!  Until then I won't be buying or borrowing any more of her books. 
 I bought this book 2 years ago - almost to the day...I have the receipt stuck in the book...I can only seem to force myself to get to page 50 and then I just can't stomach anymore and I put it down for 2 more years. Maybe this is a piece of art. Something to be treasured and something that should change your life. But pleasure reading shouldn't be this painful. I wish the store would take it back - but I think I've probably had it for too long 
 She routinely misrepresents evidence and publishes hearsay along with her own distorted theories.  She generally doesn't understand the first thing about computing technology, security or the voting process.  Sadly, I agree that electronic voting is a serious problem and there are terrible security implications with how it is being conducted.  However, Bev Harris is NOT the person to get answers from.  Her conclusions are wrong and she ends up trashing the very people struggling to help the problem.  And yes, I have had the displeasure of watching her distort the facts in front of my very eyes.  She's part of the problem, not the solution 
 This is the most horrible product I have ever bought  in my entire life so if you want a nice gun this is not it 
 This has to be one of the worst casebooks I have ever read. The biggest complaint I have is that, for some reason, the author feels compelled to reveal the entire legislative history for every statute or immigration guideline. So if you are studying INA 237(x)(x)(x) you will not only get the very recent changes that led up to the statute, but the last 30 years of history. For true scholars of the law who have nothing better to do with their lives than read irrelevant legislative history I am sure this will please them. For actual law students who think succinctness is a virtue, stay away. Another minor problem is that the author has failed to label his notes. Labeling notes is a very common practice and is very helpful in summarizing what the note is about without having to first read it. Of course, I find the very subject of immigration law to be about as boring a class in law school as I have ever taken so maybe this casebook is just making the best out of a bad situation 
 I couldn't stomach this movie for long. I kept waiting, hoping for some redeeming quality to emerge but the language, nudity, and explicit sexual content was too much for me so I turned it off and never saw the entire film. If there was any poignant, brilliant story with any depth, it was buried in filth and raunch. I would not recommend film this to anyone. Nicholas Cage or not, it was disgusting.  
 it was very vague and didn't give you a lot of information. It is a good book for a 3rd grader.  
 My SECOND review, as my first did not get printed (AS USUAL).  Anyway, I'll try to make this short and sweet.  I usually try and give credits to directors, producers, writers, and actors in most of my movie reviews; however, I'm going to make an exception here.  I've read other reviews that have called this gigantic turd "hilarious", "Night of the Living Dead + money + color", "wonderful for gorehounds", etc., etc., etc.  All I can say is it must not take much to please you people.  This is, WITHOUT A DOUBT, the WORST excuse for a movie I've ever seen.  (My most humble apologies to Tobe Hooper and "Mortuary").  The whiners of horror movies are always moaning and groaning, "why don't critics take horror movies more seriously?".  Well, Einstein, here's a glowing example.  This is nothing but grade D trash:  horrible effects, horrible acting, horrible writing, horrible directing.  You name it; it's NOT in there.  This movie's most FEEBLE attempts at humor come off as just that:  feeble.  I bought this, together with "Dead and Breakfast", and I can't begin to tell you which one is worse.  So, here's a little advice from me:  go check out a book at the library, buy a book, go to a REAL movie, have your hair done, have a manicure--do ANYTHING but waste your time on this gag-fest (for all the WRONG reasons) of a movie.  Another one that I would give ZERO stars to, if I could. 
 What a disjointed mess, talk about cashing in on fame.  All he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book.   I could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper.  I was not that enamored with Liar's Poker and this book has done it for me with this author.   It was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good 
 No. No, no, no, no, no. Well, maybe. At the library, this book was in the Young Adult section. I suppose it should be moved to the children's section, because as I read it, I felt like a child learning to read. The style was rather bland, and much like the stories I used to write when I was in the fifth grade. The style was the first thing to turn me away, as well as several cop-outs in the writing.   Cop-outs how? Well, it wasn't very realistic. At all. While yes, most teens are overly dramatic, their parents and teachers aren't. It didn't seem realistic that a parent would leave once a child came out of the closet, rather than kicking him out. It didn't seem realistic that the parents ALL became so easily adjusted to it. It WAS realistic that some of the teens were so naive, but it didn't help at all. Things went exactly as the characters wanted them to, and it wasn't that interesting. It was rather obvious how everything was going to happen; when one character said they wanted something to happen at a certain place and time, it happened. There were hardly any obstacles, and the background characters were all really, really fake.  The plot to me, seemed a bit dry as well. Overall, the book didn't impress me. Yes, it may be aimed towards younger people, but hey, I AM a younger person. I wasn't impressed, however. Others may have been, but it just wasn't happening for me.  Hey, the guys on the cover are sorta cute. Sorta 
 I am trying to do some quick refresher reading on ada for a job interview and this book has been sitting around unread since i went on an ada course 5 or so years ago. It would be less painful to swallow this book whole and pass it out the other end in the same state than read it. Its riddled with profound opinions on the philosophy behind the language and i skipped the first 4 chapters as irrelevant rubbish but still have the rest padded out excessively with this stuff instead of getting down to the actual language. I think I should have read the book I got back in 1983 written by the course lecturer instead even though it was published before the language was finalise 
 First off...the Pink Spiders are in no way punk. Secondly, this music is so polished and poppy it lacks any type of genuine feeling to it. Third, the whole "pink" gimmick can only take you so far...even Pink had to change her hair color.   I guess for fans of pop music this band will make you excited, but for me it just makes me ill 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 This movie is nearly 3 hours of hot air as bad as the movie The Hindenburg! If George C Scott saw this movie he would be rolling over in his grave! I yawned so much that I got a charley horse in my neck and nearly had a stroke from being bored to tears! Saddam Hussein should be strapped in a chair and be forced to watch this movie- maybe then would he confess of his atrocities that he committed! Stay as Far and Away from this movie as you can! 
 Read the reviews and checked out the book.  What's wrong with the narrator?  Since this is a "fictional" biography, the narrator can wiggle his way in and out of funky --I mean, funky situations.  I sense a neurotic writer who is probably insecure and a bit on the "edge" (not cutting edge, but psycho-edge), who used this book as therapy.   Yeah, the writer intrigues at a real elementary, base level. . .  The hapa is represented in such a pathetic way, I was wondering if Fulbeck was resurrecting the tragic, neurotic,psycho mulatto (the main character of this book is reminiscent of Soaphead Church of Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye. . . Pathetic.  Bad representation of hapas.  Get over yourself!  Please don't speak for all hapa guys, just your "fictional, biographical" self.  Can we move into the 21st century with more realistic representations of hapas already! 
 If you plan to learn php from this book, i suggest you start looking for another, this is just a dictionary about all terminolgy and commands regards php, but with no excercices!!! well.. there are a few lazy excercises. Its only a description of the methods i mean.. if you are reading about the function echo() you will read something like. "ok, you should use echo in this way "echo "this book sucks", echo is for show you some info on screen, or if you are reading about loops, like for.. "ok. for is for looping! like 1 to 10".. that's it! now you are an php expert!!!.. if there was a posibility to rate this as -5 i would 
 I mean, really.  SHARP OBJECTS has gotten tons of media coverage and nary a negative review in sight.  I usually read hundreds of novels a year, and I really don't get the big deal about this novel at all.  This book contains some sharply written prose, but the mystery plotline is quite weak.  SHARP OBJECTS is essentially a literary novel that the publisher has labeled a "mystery" to push more copies on unsuspecting consumers.  This slow-paced novel is not much of a whodunit and contains almost no suspense.  This novel does have a big plot twist near the end, but I found it to be implausable and pointless, tacked on for shock value and nothing more.    My major problem with this novel is the characters.  All of the major players in SHARP OBJECTS are cartoonishly nasty and dysfunctional.  Most of the characters are the residents of a small town in Missouri, and Gillian Flynn seems to have nothing but contempt for most of them.  The heroine of this book is an introspective bore, and possesses little personality beyond her self-destructive behavior.  I didn't like or identify with anyone in SHARP OBJECTS, which for me is a fatal problem with any novel.  I found this book tough to finish.   As Stephen King notes in his blurb, this is a nasty little novel.  The main question is whether you want to waste your time and money on something like this.  In the end, I regretted doing so.   
 Um, guys?  Isn't this the guy who testified with David Kay to Congress about "Saddam's nuclear program?"  So, um, now we know there was no program, right?  Which the CIA knew years ago, when Saddam's son-in-law defected.  So this book is, what exactly?  And how stupid are the reviewers below?  "Reads like a spy novel" indeed.  Apparently, this guy is still on the taxpayer's payroll, in charge of "re-educating" Iraqi scientists 
 The plot of The Unburied intrigued me so much that I started reading this book as soon as I bought it. At first, I thought the writing was quite imaginative. Charles Palliser has a rather vivid and compelling imagination. But as I continued to read I noticed that this novel lacked plot and characterization. There are so many dead ends and unimportant pieces of information that I felt lost. I don't always have problems with miscellaneous information, but it appears that the clues and so-called twists were thrown in for no reason other that to lengthen the book. At the end, I ended up closing the book with the intention of never opening it again. The writing is too disjointed to be enjoyed. Disappointing.. 
 This guy is actually planning to release an album? What is the world coming to? He is probably one of the most boring and out- of class singers of all time. What kind of 17-year old would make a jazz album? TALK ABOUT LAME! 
 Julia Child was a lovely person with an interesting life but this book as written is unreadable. Poor sentence structure and continual,unecessary use of parenthesis. Try My Life in France. Much better 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 This book could have been written by any party affiliate decrying the state of the media in favor for the other party.We all know about the use of statistics and anecdotal evidence and the authors hate-mongering against Conservatives leads little credibility to use of such devices. If you're a Democratic (or someone who writes reviews and says I'm a Conservative, but...) this book is going to help you account for the tremendous beatings you've taken in the polls and your increasing loss of popularity across the nation. If you're a Republican you're going to see it as another whine-and-moan fest of democrats trying to explain, once again, how they are victims.The author is a partisan who generates diviseness between parties so he can gin up book sales.  In both cases, you know exactly what you are getting 
 Someone told me this was a great bluegrass band and I should run out and buy this CD. I have never regretted a CD purchase more. If there were standards for defining bluegrass, this would defy them--and I don't mean that as a compliment. The main vocals are utterly devoid of talent, much less vibrato--sounds like whoever sang the "Friends" theme song. It's all very plucky, full of pointless stops and starts.  Yes, these young musicians clearly know their craft--perhaps too well, because instead of listenable tunes, the entire album pushes the limits of tempo and style for what seems to be annoying experimentation for it's own sake. If you like the rich, rhythmic sounds of AK+US or other traditional, foot-tapping bluegrass, avoid this album like the plague. If you like uppity prodigies experimenting for kicks, then buy this 
 I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book. Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric. After reading beautiful books such as Cold Mountain and Brideshead Revisited, to mention just two, I found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that I knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read. At page four I was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut 
 After having made very positive experiences with the lonely planet travel guides we also bought the one on Ireland. But this one was really a waste of time and money. The recommendations are out of date, some of the B&Bs recommended in the book are probably the worst in town and the city descriptions are absolutely useless.  Following the lonely planet we missed some really very nice spots (as we found out later) and spent some nights in very sleazy B&Bs.  Every other travel guide will do a better job. 
 Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it.   Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants.   Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else.   I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain 
 this book has a title that appeals to the heart of every parent, particularly new one and this is the only reason it gets sold. There is no valuable information in that book other that what is compiled from other books by prominent pediatricians. If you want to help your baby sleep, read Dr. Wisebluth book "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child" 
 As a baseball fan and photography buff, I liked the photos in this book.  But once you look through it, you'll just sit it on the shelf and be done with it.  And that's not something I'm happy with considering the cost of this book 
 The book covers a fascinating subject because Porfirio Rubirosa was among the top playboys of his day. However, the writing style of author Shawn Levy is of the tabloid variety with little to back his ever-present purported subjective hypothesis and lame attempts at humor.  A straightforward biography with fleshed-out facts would have been far more appreciated by this reader than the filler that comprised most of the book 
 They sent me wrong lens cover and said I ordered the wrong one..........don't think so since I got copy.......poor customer service all around..... 
  This is possibly the worst book I have ever read. It is not only inaccurate and slams ministries that have brought thousands to Christ (like John Arnott), but actually cruelly brings up very personal issues that fellow Christians are trying to heal from by the grace of God. This book has always been harmful and it is full of Pride and Judgement. Avoid it at all costs! Instead read John Eldredge, Max Lucado, or Brennan Manning 
 I will argue with my dying breath that REM is one of the greatest bands ever. I own every album they ever made and listen to them weekly. HOWEVER, there is one that only gets listened to about every four years and that is Out of Time. Why every four years? Because that is usually when I decide to give it one more chance. And every time I listen to it, I come up with the same opinion. It is a pretentious and dated piece of tripe full of filler and hooks. So many of the "songs" are just incomplete riffs and melodies, that are so sugar coated and hookish that you think it might be the first album created by a high school band hoping to cash in. Take any REM album from the early and mid-80s and play them today, the music stands up and is contemporary as anything out there. But this CD, with KRS One rapping? Yuck! Buy Monster! Buy Fables! Buy Automatic! Buy Lifes Rich! But avoid this thing unless you are just some casual listener that has never heard their earlier and superior stuff 
 DVD would not play. DVD stuck and would not go forward 
 I was looking for a Cussler-esque adventure for my recent vacation and read a few reviews of DuBrul's books.  They seemed mostly positive, so I bought a couple thinking they would be good for long airplane flights, afternoons in the sun, etc.  Sadly, both Charon's Landing and Vulcan's Forge were mind-numbingly slow, the action sequences were nothing special, the characters were wooden stereotypes, the heroes were no better than the villains, etc.  There really was nothing to hold my attention from chapter to chapter.  Mercer (the hero) acts like a pubescent boy looking down the top of every blouse and up the slit of every skirt, and DuBrul can't seem to write a decent piece of dialogue between a man and a woman.  Ultimately, I read both books, but it took the better part of a month to get through them (I usually read a Clive Cussler novel in about 2 days) because I kept putting them down and picking up other books that held more promise.  I won't be buying any more DuBrul 
 Watch is great looking but there was no battery in it. Now I have to get it to a jewlers to buy a battery. There was no indication of this in the ad or in the instructions 
 I picked up a set of these sheets at $59 (for king) so don't feel I can kick all that much, but for pete's sake - $250 is sheer insanity. I ordered in lilac (received the crystal blue- no big deal, but still!). I read many of the reviews and wasn't too terribly concerned about the wrinkling issues since my concern is softness - period. However, wrinkle factor with these sheets is so extreme as to be almost funny; shrinkage is massive (after two washings, bottom sheet barely fits at all and i'll be tossing them out after 5 washings, would imagine). Biggest complaint is that, at least to me, they're truly NOT all that soft. As a matter of fact they feel more like a bizarre sort of denim to me...they did arrive quickly, though 
 You must be kidding me!  I cannot think of a single person in the universe less qualified to write a book about sharing.  Owens puts himself before the team, tears down teammates and coaches, and has created poisonous environments on two teams (49ers and Eagles).  He shouts out "I love me some me!" on the sidelines during games.  This is not someone who should be held up as an example to our kids 
 The book is very biased towards the Mau Mau side first of all.   Second she has relied heavily on oral textimonies which she fails to question the validity of. Some of these testimonies are laugh out loud ridiculous. She may have noted that testimonies like this have been through out of African and European courts for being made up in order to secure financial compensation. Elkins rubbishes similar statements made by European and Black loyalists.  Elkins also ignores or defends Mau Mau atrocities.  Lastly she asserts that 300,000 people died during the course of the emergency, the only evidence for this is the difference between two censuses. Colonial census were notoriously inaccurate and the main reason the British managed to hide any atrocities they did commit was because they were comitted small scale. 300,000 deaths would have been impossible to keep a secret. Anderson claims around 30,000 Mau Mau died during the course of the rebellion which is closer to the truth 
 You Got Served was a horrible misrepresentation of what the b-boy scene is actually like and this instructional video pushes that misrepresentation even further. If you want to learn to breakdance buy the Breakdance step-by-step dvd released by bboy.org or any of the films in the Breakvision series 
 My bike did not come with an instruction manual. This seems to be a recurring problem with this company 
 ten years ago, this would have been a 4 star book, but you can sit down to Google and have all this and much more faster and in much greater depth.  It's a good toilet tank book, but that's about it 
 	I am a sixth grader. The Prophet of Yonwood is the third Book of Ember by Jeanne DuPrau. This book is about a girl named Nickie who visits a town named Yonwood. Someone in her family recently dies and her family inherits the house. The country is about to go into war and everybody is scared. Nickie is an 11 year old. She loves the house. She wants to get away from the city and move to Yonwood. She has three goals: 1. Keep Greenhaven, the name of the house, 2. Fall in Love, and 3. Help the world. Nickie starts to tattle on people thinking that she is doing something good but things turn bad. Yonwood isn't as good as Nickie had imagined. 	My favorite part in the book was when the army of dogs return to the town. All the people were happy that they got their dogs back and so was I. 	If you like love stories and a bit of scary parts, you would like this part. I didn't. 	This book is one of a series of three. The two other books are The City of Ember and The City of Sparks. Now you can read the books in a different order starting with The Prophet of Yonwood and continue the story or you can start with the first book, The City of Ember. The Prophet of Yonwood explains what happened in the first book but if you don't want anything given away, you should start with the first book, The City of Ember. Maybe Jeanne DuPrau should write some more of this series. I would read them.  
 Who came up with the brilliant concept to divide our children? As if this nation isn't divided enough, Katharine DeBrecht has decided to bring her "children's book" into classrooms and homes and divide children all over the nation. Firstly, children are not capable of advanced political thought, that's why children are not allowed to vote. Secondly, as an educator, I don't discourage basic political questions and concepts, but I would discourage any book filled with hateful undertones, and stereotypes such as the ones displayed in this book. The world is not black and white, there is plenty of grey- this book obviously neglects to mention that. I'm a libertarian so quite frankly, I don't care much for liberals or republicans, regardless hateful political books are useless for both children and adults.  The book also uses a great deal of sarcasm, which I think is the lowest form of humour 
 Ok, first off, i'd like to say, i'm an intermediate c++ programmer, I dabbled for c++ for about a year, and have been seriouse about c++ for the last 6 months. I'm not saying that gives me the right to pass judgement on this book, but I do think it says that I know enough about coding to decide how I feel about the book, and if its right for me. . . Now thats out of the way, so lets move on to why the book isnt good for me.   First off, if you can, take a look at the code used in the examples of this book before you buy it. Why? Because thats the biggest reason i dont like it. The coding style this guy has is just terrible to me! Now that, without a doubt, is a matter of personal oppinion, the code is functional, it works, it compiles , i just dont prefer the style. Now, if you can, look at the code examples in Game Programming All In One 2nd Edition, you'll see cleaner, more easy to read code.   Second point, the code is slightly buggy. I know i said that it worked, and compiled. It does, it works fine, for buggy software. The style that this guy has, and the way he makes his programs makes for buggy, and hard to read programs. He doesent really break problems down like he says he's going to. In a well coded, clean game engine, you should be able to read through the code and say to yourself "hey, i know what this will do, i can see the output in my head"....     Third point, The teaching style of the author. The author is rather boring, and doesent have much of a humor, wich i believe can make things a little easyer to learn. A laugh here and there is good for you. Another problem i had with his teaching style is, theres no clarity in what your supposed to be doing as you read through his examples.  The way i went through this book was, i'd read, then type out the example, then read the explanation...  you'd think that would work yeah?   No, when i got to the end of the chapter, i realized that we were not working on just 1 src file, we were working on also a header file, there was no transition, so your kindof running blind....  unless you wanna copy/paste the code and use it as a buggy sortof crutch.  well, thats my basic rundown. if you want to start game programming, and are familiar with c++, i would definately not reccomend this book to my friends...  i'd reccomend Game Programming All In One 2nd Editio 
   This book is an embarrassment.  It is cheap for a reason: This little book is all of 96 pages long, including the introduction.  The best edition of Sun Tzu is the Special Edition that contains two English versions; one simple version, like this one without commentary or notes and another version that the complete, fully documented Giles's Edition and, in addition, it has the text in Chinese Characters.  If you are going to spend the time and effort to read and understand Sun Tzu, you may as well spend a few dollars more and have a book that is worth the money.    
 Not such a hot book. I would read other books on the subject. 
 i struggled to get past the first 150 pages of this pile of words.  too bad the thing only runs 270 pages or so, because alan furst has become a first-rate cure for insomnia 
 I made the huge mistake of wasting my time and money on this CD set. She has absolutely no clue regarding the 'law of attraction' and her judgmental, 'you are pathetic and I'm wonderful' attitude was enough to make ask for my money back. I thought of destroying the CD's because like watching a slasher film I don't think they're good for anyone but I simply don't want her receiving any royalties for the garbage she's handing out as truth. If you are interested in something uplifting and something that will teach you about "Your Power To Create" please look elsewhere 
 True community cannot be anything but INTENTIONAL nor anything but RURAL.  Trying to bring people together in an urban or suburban setting is asking for problems.  Zoning and occupancy laws, selfish individualism, pollution, noise, fear and distrust, and the lack of pristine natural places is NOT amenable to true, deep, genuine human community.  Only in open, natural spaces and environments free from those things that make cities and suburbs so loathsome can meaningful communal culture be built.  This culture can only be born and cultivated OUTSIDE OF mainstream society, and to believe otherwise is the height of folly.  It is idiotic to think that people can simply meet and congregate once a week or every once in a while, and call that "community".  Suburban neighborhoods should also not be called "communities", as they are anything but.  The very concept of community is rooted in the deep human need for honest and close intimacy and companionship, not in the superficial settings so frequently found in most institutions.  Superficiality is THE social way of life in cities and suburbs, so to expect anything more than that is ignorance.  Connection with nature and connection with other human beings is inseparable; natural rural and deep rural settings are the ONLY environments where profound love and connection can begin and grow.  This book needs to embrace that understanding and encourage a culture-wide move away from industrialism and city-living.  We must return to a counterculture, and also to Mother Nature.  There IS no other way 
 Somehow this author managed to make an interesting topic into and unreadable uninteresting book. It read like a 328 page book report 
 For those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a S/M relationship, I would highly suggest the Japanese film, "Moonlight Whispers" over "Maitresse." That film is a gentle coming-of-age film with male sub/fem dom theme, while "Maitresse" is a somewhat confused film about an ex-con who stumbles into a dungeon and a (highly unlikely) vanilla relationship with a dominitrix.   The ex-con cannot deal with "her career" eventually and threatens her to quit, etc. (At some point, you get the idea that the director himself really doesn't understand where the Domina is coming from.)  What started out as an interesting film with a provacative opening soon falls apart about halfway through. The writer/director seems to lose the narrative thread of the film and things degenerate with the ex-con wanting to buy the dominitrix out from her protection (or pimp, for want of a better word). Then, we watch as the ex-con -- in a totally unrelated and gratuitous foray -- goes to a slaughterhouse, where a real horse is shown killed onscreen, strung up and stabbed and drained of blood as it kicks helplessly (this image will upset you for weeks, believe me! [I feel like it's my duty to WARN YOU!]). And the film gets even worse from there and finally ends up with a ridiculous car accident and the two main characters laughing like idiots. Totally stupid (like the writer/director suddenly ran out of ideas).  Believe me, I really WANTED to like this movie. I ignored the negative reviews, because there are so few "real" films on this subject. But I was sorely disappointed and depressed by it.  If you need to see this film, rent it. It's definitely a "one view" film at best; and it will be a film that will leave you angry (because the horse scene) and vaguely disgusted -- and generally bummed out. Too bad.  "Moonlight Whispers" is a much better, respectful treatment of S/M, a film with real characters and nuance -- one that seeks to explore real psychological (and sexual orientation) questions, while also being a beautiful film to watch. That film deserves to be seen -- and a wider audience!     
 President Reagan provided the author, Edmund Morris, unprecedented access to a President at work.  No biographer was afforded so much time, and access to officials, meetings, and documents.  In return, prior to publication Morris concludes Reagan is an opaque enigma, and decides to insert himself into the story as a fictional character that is supposed to help us better understand Reagan by this character having an on-going dialogue with Reagan.  I have never in my life experienced such ego as this author.  The book is a mess because the reader is constantly having to concentrate on whether a conversation or event really happened or whether it didn't.  To those who stated one can easily disseminate the fictional Morris character from the non-fictional aspects of the book, I would concur, however, rather than focusing on how Reagan's history is impacting you personally like one normally would, one has to constantly and consciously focus on dissiminating what is, and isn't, real.  I gave up by the time Reagan hit his union years.    We had the opportunity to understand a President who will go down as one of our best, instead all the energy that Reagan and his staff put into creation of this historical record will only be helpful to scholars who have the time and energy for exegsis; which is why I give it two stars rather than one.    I recommend the Lou Cannon trilogy instead of this book 
 There are two main reasons why this Superman film fails to fly inspite of the special effects.  What Singer and company have missed is the heart of Superman - virtues.  The ideal of the American way (noticably absent) is supposed to go hand in hand with truth and justice.  Donner made the mistake in the 70's of having Superman sleep with Lois, and now Singer adds insult to injury by having Superman discover he has an illegitmate child that he doesn't take responsibility for (deadbeat dad).  Using his super powers to invade the privacy of Lois in her home, drags Superman down to the level of creepy (peeping tom).  The second issue concerns personality.  Routh and Bosworth look nice but have no charm and no chemistry.  These are the two ingredients that made Reeves and Kidder so endearing.  A new director, writers, and cast is needed.  Until then, at least there's Superman 1. 
 After blazing through the first two volumes, and halfway into the conclusion, my reading, and enjoyment of the series came to screeching halt.   Somewhere between the first page and 200 of the finale, Takeo and Kaede had became bumbling, inept and whining caracatures of themselves. WHAT happened to the strength and insight of the caracters I had learned to love? Their simpering and laughable "decisions" are a gross insult to the series...   Damn, and I was SO enjoying it too 
 I bought this DVD for my third-grade twins who are having difficulty memorizing math facts, and don't quite understand the relation between these math facts and the real world.  I thought this DVD would be perfect, explaining basic math facts with humor and real life examples.  But their explanations are way over the heads of this age group.  In explaining the concept of "carrying over" while adding, for instance, here is what is said and written out on the screen:  "Carrying over means you take the digit in the tensplace of the digit place sum, and carry over that digit to the next digit place to the left in your addition problem.  You do this whenever the sum amount in the digit place is greater than nine."  Yeah, *I* get it, but it is not the simplest way to present it to an elementary grade child.  I'm not certain what grade level this series is for -- perhaps middle school and above? -- but definitely not for those just starting out 
 Itsy Bitsy spider is probably the third most favourite rhyme of most kids.  The reason?  The words have such a wonderful rhythm about them and it sounds so plausible!  This book does away with that magic.  The new lines seem to have been thrust to sort of fit into the same rhythm, there is  no natural flow. To make matters worse the concepts are very confusing in places! fOR eg the the phrase "off came the fan", My son expected the fan to come "off" like his bandaid, not turned off.  I wasnt impressed with the art work either 
 Caveat - I wasn't exactly expecting to finish PE a die-hard believer.  That said, I was unprepared for how much of my skepticism stemmed from the authors' willingness to believe anything, and mask their suspension of disbelief as objectivity.  According to legend, the US Navy conducted invisibility experiments on one of their ships during WWII.  Not simply invisible, the ship actually teleported from its berth in Philadelphia.  However, the little-understood process played havoc with the crew - even after the experiment's end, some crewmen would "blink" in and out of existence, become frozen in time or catch fire.  One man walked through a wall, never to be seen again.  Of course, the Navy denies the whole thing....  While the legend places the story during the dark days of WWII, the legend itself began in the mid 1950's, with the publication of "The Case for the UFO" by Morris Jessup.  (Aknowledging that Jessup is no scientist, Berlitz & Moore nevertheless refer to him as "Dr. Jessup".)  Believing that propulsion of UFO's (and perhaps future human spacecraft) lay in solving Einstein's "Unified Field Theory", Jessup encouraged readers to press for research in that area. Jessup's book caught the attention of Carl Allen (AKA Carlos Allende), who spent the war in the Merchant Marine.  In a series of rambling letters Allen insisted that Einstein had solved UFT, and the solution was successfully used to cloak a USN warship in wartime experiments.  Though claiming to have witnessed the event from deck of a nearby freighter, Allen goes further than detailing his observation - exhaustively describing the travails of the crew, Einstein's seeming retraction of UFT, his admission to Bertrand Russel that UFT was complete but had to be suppressed at least until after WWIII, the identity of one of the chief scientists attached to the project, and that UFT had anything to do with the experiment.  To get his point across, Allen/Allende even forwarded a copy of Jessup's book (heavily annotated with his own theories, many having nothing to do with the Philadelphia Experiment) to the Office of Naval Research.  There it piqued the personal interest of at least 2 officers, and slowly became the story-that-wouldn't-die.  A few years later, a depressed Jessup was found dead in his car.  Allende/Allen became something of a cult celeb, sometimes retracting what he had previously claimed, often warning against the ominous dangers of UFT even as he seemed to beg others to look into it.  Berlitz and Moore piece Allen/Allende together with what are supposed to be other pieces of a puzzle that will prove the Philadelphia Experiment actually occurred.  Instead, the result is far less than the sum of its parts: Berlitz and Moore place far more weight on any of the individual pieces than common sense would allow, and they find a better fit between the different pieces than you'd get in a jigsaw puzzle.  Nothing in PE lacks a more reasonable explanation than the authors can provide.  At the beginning, and towards the end of the book, the authors mention coming in contact with others who claim to have met alleged crewmembers of the ship involved in the experiment - but neither name nor any other convincing corroborating information comes out (Allende at least included his Merchant Marine ID in his letters).  The authors add to the puzzle, but never actually establish that the Philadelphia Experiment actually occurred.  An anonymous radar scientist, who doesn't claim to have worked on the project, clairifies how events would have had to occurr if the legend were true.  Another scientist - given a psuedonym because it would upset "the status quo" - describes wartime discussions on a project that we're supposed to believe developed into the Philadelphia Experiment.  Named "Rinehart" after a similar character in the novel "Thin Air" (a thriller inspired by the legend) the doctor describes discussions but never mentions witnessing the experiment, nor any discussions of its aftermath - obvious details for such a pivotal figure.  "Rinehart" never even mentions Allende, even though it had been Allende's letters that clued the authors into Rinehart's existence (under yet another pseudonym).  The authors never explain how they managed to find "Rinehart" - they need to protect his identity even though the government obviously knows who he is, and anybody else would have the same difficulty tracking him down as the authors of this book.  The authors describe how the experiments of another scientist in "electrogravity" never caught on despite their apparent success - suggesting they were suppressed.  Though Allende described reading stories about the Experiment's sailors in Philadelphia newspapers, the only article that could be found is obviously bogus: a xerox of an obviously fabricated article describing a bar-room brawl by sailors who mysteriously vanish -  but no mention of date, newspaper, or the reporter, nor any specific facts in the article about the event, like the name of the bar or those of witnesses.  The authors make the barest efforts to answer the questions they raise, and then merely add more pieces to the puzzle, without explaining how one piece corroborates any others.  Though appearing critical and objective, it's impossible to believe that the authors haven't already settled on the idea that the experiment actually occurred - they explicitly question Allende, yet never express their doubts, let alone attempt to deal with our own.   But what's the danger of that?  I mean, who cares if they can get their readers to believe the legend of the "Philadelphia Experiment".  Unfortunately, "Philadelphia" feeds on our prejudices of secret conspiracies, and relies on our willingness to do so with little prompting - never a positive thing.  Worse, it's not even interesting - barely substantive enough to raise the sort of questions that would make a more critical investigation a stirring story. 
 Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because "society" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an "A" vs. students who earn an "F". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the "wealthier" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?   
 While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with "questionable" character traits. Bartolome De Las Casas, a European minister who lived in the same time as Colombus, gives a much more realistcally bleek look at the Spanish invasion of the Americas. Because Morison's focus shifts so rapidly from the bad to the good, it loses major points for realism. The book reads more like a 3rd grade textbook; Morison would have us believe Santa Claus and the toothfairy exists along side a saintly Christopher Columbus 
 this book is inbetween action and history and by that i mean that 6 out of 8 chapters involve no action whatsoever besides i little thing on spys while the 7 chapter involved the bombing and the 8th involved whom died and who was a hero if i had wonted to learn about the purple machine then i wouldve gone to a museum and learned about it instead of learning what they said before the attack which is totaly useless and it does inolve if not racial hatred itself it still "forgot" to tell of dead japanese and the japanese hero born that day anyway read this book if you wish to read a poorly substituted substitue for action or your moms forcing you to 
 Ok so when I first started reading the book I thought all right this is ok.  And the book went along and I still thought it was ok good at times but just a decent book.  Then I finished the book and I realized something.  Nothing had happened really.  There was nothing to tell you what the overall plot would be for the triolgy it was just them going from once place to the other.  Its like oh there is a ghost we should follow it, yeah because that is such a smart thing to do.  This book just annoyed me so much because nothing happend in it.  I don't really understand why so many people love this book.  This book is average at best and not much else.      
 I'm hoping that most of the people who wrote these reviews didn't actually stoop so low as to buy the book.  I read a few pages of it, and this is truly 7th-8th grade level writing.  I didn't realize that Bill's narcissism extended to the point at which he actually thought his writing was INTERESTING, rather than just blatantly one-sided and sickeningly arrogant.  Bill should stick to repetitive, "I know better," conservative babble - it gives us liberals/radicals/freethinkers something to make fun of 
 While Singer's book may provide some useful information about the global warming debate, it's overshadowed by shoddy organization and a weak writing style.  The repetition of the same key information makes it appear as if Singer has ample evidence for his claim; however, his three major points appear in the foreword.  Don't waste your time reading the whole book 
 After hearing Paris' dance songs on XM Radio, I thought this album would be equally as great. Not true. This album was a disappointment, to say the least. The teenie-boppers may love it, but it was quite "cheezy". I still like the same two songs as before, but as for the rest of the album?? You be the judge, but I'd wait to buy it used.   
 Prof. Butler has many references to Hegel and Lacan but remarkably few to the play itself. Of those only one or two are in Greek. It is not at all clear that she is familiar with the language--for example: on page 8 of her book she transliterates Antigone's response to Creon as "kai phemi drasai kouk aparnoumai to ne". This may be a misprint but in any case the last word should be "mey" (mu eta). Does Prof. Butler understand the force of the initial "kai" or the function of the article at the end? I have no sense of engagement with the line--instead she offers two translations, both inaccurate. . The problem is that Antigone is such an ambiguous text that even a reading in Greek using the lines as evidence is problematic. She seems to depend on what others have said about Antigone rather than going through the work of actually reading the play in Greek by herself. The line I quoted is I think -- apart from translating "glory" as "kleos"(correct as far as it goes though had she bothered to study the linguistic history and possibilities of the word she might have helped her argument)-- the only sign of any contact with the Greek. The passage she presents about the primacy of the brother over the child--a passage that has troubled readers of Antigone since the nineteenth century-- is given in English and her conclusion that Antigone's notion of Kinship is eccentric seems to suggest she has not read recent scholarship. Rather Prof. Butler has an agenda (nb her anti-Catholicism) which she presents using the play as a forum. She is certainly entitled to her agenda and entitled to argue that Antigone represents it. Problem is she offers no textual evidence and has I fear little or no familiarity with Greek. If you want to make an argument you have to back it up with evidence not hearsay--where's the beef 
 The Author should have taken a lesson from the title of her own last chapter ('Repeating the Same Mistakes'); there is way too much repitition in the content.  After the first chapter, there is not much new to be learned 
 Obtuse: a : lacking sharpness or quickness of sensibility or intellect : INSENSITIVE, STUPID b : difficult to comprehend : not clear or precise in thought or expression synonym see DULL. per Merriam-Webster  Having a very succesful professional sales career, spanning 21 years, I found this mini-book to be a real effort written by someone who has never been in sales.  If one was to follow these simple tidbits, they would find themself with little or no Customers at all. Customers would like to be treated as humans, not a bank of purchase orders.  The methods and "secrets" this authors portrays as effective will destroy any Customer relationship one is trying to build. It will undermine the true effectiveness a sales professional has both with the Customer and internally with the organization he/she represents. The adopter of these secrets will truly become a pain-maker to those around them.  I can only hope my competitors adopt these techniques 
 After watching the movie which I enjoyed.  I bought the book thinking it would be just as good if not better.  Boy was I wrong, the book was horrible.  I could barely finish reading it.  This is one case where the movie is much better than the book 
 If you've read Susan Isaac's "Compromising Positions," you've read this book.  Not sure whether it was deliberately done but if felt like entire scenes were lifted intact.  I was surprised and disappointed.  I've enjoyed this writer's other books 
 I find it hard to believe that the author has even visited Cuba, let alone lived there. Not being an American, I have legally spent quite a bit of time in Havana myself - and not as a tourist, either - and there are so many glaring inconsistencies between this book and the realities it describes, I would have sworn it was written by someone who was only going on third-party descriptions and their own wild imagination.  Jineterismo is indeed a gaping wound in Cuban society, but it certainly doesn't work the way this book describes it - quite far from it. There is a lot of uncommon ground between Cuban-style jineterismo and generic western-type prostitution, and this author's take is remarkably closer to the second one. To give an example: no Cuban jinetera would be "sitting by herself" anywhere, let alone at a "cafe near the Habana Libre Hotel," and with a "stack of papers" in front of her no less. That picture is straight out of the US, and anyone doing said things in Cuba would never, ever be mistaken for anything other than a foreigner, not even by the naivest American tourist. More importantly, the jineteras sell romance more than they sell sex, which is amongst the most alluring things about them. One may pay them, but one is always left with the impression that they're being generous and "helping out" someone with whom they had a good time, not contemptuously paying a professional for services rendered as described in the book.  The book may be enjoyable as a read - I don't know, as personally I was unable to finish it for being so annoyed with the false picture it paints. My own impression is that it is naive and rather sophomoric. If you do choose to read it, please keep in mind it is pure fiction. If a literary glimpse into modern-day Cuba (shocking underworld included) is what you're after, there are far better books out there by Cuban authors, and even an excellent relevant collection of short stories and book excerpts 
 As cute and talented as I think Hugh Jackman is, this production was a waste of time, space and money. Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves.  The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it does-badly.  It's not the worse movie I've seen, but it's surprisingly close.  Please don't waste your time with this film 
 A marvellous actor; an incredible voice - but why is it that his album is one of the most unoriginal and dull experiences that so many of us are fed up of hearing? "Unpredictable" is a disappointing album that will probably be a success amongst those faint-hearted fans of the cheesy, clichï¿½ love-songs that have come to make me feel nauseous. All I can say is, Jamie, I know you can do better 
 I've tried this razor for 5 weeks, both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that I've ever used. It doesn't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble. I should have bought a new Norelco instead of this. My old Norelco always shaved me close. This Panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor, or to be used in a pinch. But for a close shaving everyday razor, this isn't the one to buy.  Oh well, I waited too long to send it back 
 First off, I subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years, and enjoyed it. But the "main guy" Robert Kennedy, is someone who offends me both personally and politically. He assumes that every girl/women reading that magazine is tiny. For his information, some of us work out 5-6 days a week and eat well, and are still heavy-set. His comments on heavy-set people are offensive, thoughtless, and sometimes even downright cruel. Nonetheless, the pictures/articles were inspiring to me, and it is a decent fitness magazine 
 Unfortunately, Sidney Wolfe and the whole "Worst Pills" business enterprise is riding on the reputation of Public Citizen as a champion for consumers, but has failed to live up to it with this guide. In some cases, warnings are included regarding various drugs that are not based on scientific reports, but rather, are based on the marketing literature and information from the pharmaceutical companies themselves -- hardly an unbiased, consumer-oriented source of information. Consider as one example the book's "Do Not Use" warning regarding the prescription drug, Armour Thyroid. Rather than offering any research to support this severe recommendation (because there ISN'T any research), the "guide" instead quotes the AMA and the American Thyroid Association, two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the thyroid drug makers who want to put Armour -- a far less expensive drug -- out of business. If this is the sort of "unbiased information" you want about the drugs you take, you might as well go ahead and just read the pharmaceutical company pamphlets. If millions of thyroid patients taking Armour Thyroid were to follow the advice in "Worst Pills," the only thing that ends up for the worse is our health. I definitely do NOT recommend this book in any way. -- Mary J. Shomon, Thyroid Patient Advocate and Autho 
 Okinawans no longer have the greatest longevity in Japan, therefore in the world, and they never had a significant lead.  During the past year or so they have been superseded by at least two other Japanese prefectures.  It is important to realize that the difference between the Okinawan people's longevity and that of some other Japanese prefectures never was great enough to be statistically significant; it was no more than two or three months of difference--in life spans exceeding 80 years!  Furthermore, the people in those other prefectures are culturally and ethnically very different from the Okinawans.  Their lifestyles and, for the most part, their diets just are not the same, yet they enjoy lives just as long or longer than the Okinawans do.  Suzuki's work (I have seen pieces of it outside this book) is important because it begins to identify basic, general diet and lifestyle elements that are associated with longevity in any culture, but the Willcox brothers, who seem to know very little about Okinawa or Japan but have a lot of marketing savvy, have added so much new age fashion and dreamworld conjecture, if not outright falsehood, that the book is little more than hype as it comes from their hands.  Suzuki and his work have been elbowed out of the way in the creation of a book aimed at exploiting fad followers and the gullible.  This I know from having lived in Okinawa and Japan for over twenty years, and that is among the people, not in some expat enclave or doing the martial arts or spirituality thing.  And this I know from having seen Japanese newspaper and television documentary presentations of Suzuki's work.  The essence of his findings is that longevity is closely associated with moderate consumption of mostly whole foods, preferably fresh, with limited quantities of animal flesh, and light consumption of alcohol if you must, all in a lifestyle characterized by moderate but very regular exercise gained through daily activities and continuing into old age, close, generally harmonious family and community ties and a very relaxed attitude toward life--and to a people's growing lots of their own vegetables to help make ends meet.  It might be noted that the Okinawans' historically moderate diet is tied basically to the relatively low per-capita income of the prefecture, and that the other areas in Japan with similar or greater longevity have similarly low income rates.   The people do not live in outright poverty, but of necessity many of them do live frugally, and that limits caloric intake.  It is not so much that they have a low fat diet, or that any one aspect of their diet is vitally important or some sort of secret gift or "program," except this: that they eat a great variety of mostly whole, home prepared food always in moderation.  Younger Okinawans, blessed with all the modern conveniences, including cars, fast food and the vast selection of instant or factory prepared foods now stocked by supermarkets throughout Japan, are beginning to struggle with obesity and alarming rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis and so on.  (Sound familiar?)  There is no great secret here and, as of reading this, if you did not already know (most people do these days), you now know the simple secrets of longevity.  You do not need this book and all the extraneous hype the brothers Willcox have put into it 
 As a Russian Student at Moscow Lomonsov State University, my whole education is surrounded by Russia, Russians, and most of all history. I love it. But I don't love this book. I've had it for almost three years and still can't get around to finishing it all. It's a big, big book. One of the reason why I love history books so much is because they are a bargain! However that didn't turn me off, I actually was quite happy with the amount of information and the color excepts were fantastic. I can tell the author is enthusiasm for the cultural history because it goes from speaking about traveling musicians to how Peter the Great abhorred the unwesternized ways of Moscow. I mean, it goes from one thing to an completely different topic in only a paragraph on one page, and then picks up back with describing the local music of the small villages. The information is so rich and he wants to describe everything to us at once that the reader can get so overwhelmed and lost that it becomes boring to read. It isn't my first history book and I have so many unexciting textbooks I have to read, but I rather read my law book -- in Cyrillic -- then attempt to actually finish this book. You would think with around 700 pages he would be able to take his time. No doubt, this is for the serious reader and someone who is in need to cite something for their term paper (the index works very well indeed, that's one star) and the major information it gives you that you could hardly find in a text book (that's another star) but as reading you  
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 Some good action scenes: the fight with Charles Haid, the final showdown, etc., but on the whole not at all credible.   Granted, in any cop movie, a certain amount of liberties have to be taken with reality.  But this was too much.  To list just one example, early in the film, Woods guns a guy down and then instead of hanging around to answer questions from the department about the shoot, promptly leaves with the prostitute who's also a witness to the shooting.  That by itself would have merited termination in any ordinary police department.    One can reply that similar scenarios occur all the time in the Lethal Weapon and Die Hard films.  Perhaps, but those films, in their way, acknowledge that they're more or less cartoon fantasies.  The problem with "Cop" is, it wants to be taken seriously as a piece of work - "gritty" and "real" - while still maintaining the adolescent macho fantasy.  Eg. the ridiculous scene with Woods and his daughter followed by the pretentious, overacted "innocence kills" argument with his wife.  When you hear dialogue and you hear a writer speaking rather than a character, something's gone wrong.    William Goldman made a similar and, I thought, correct criticism of "L.A. Confidential."  That is, you are not allowed to make a "serious", "gritty" police film while keeping the standard action, bubblegum movie silliness.  You have to make a choice about what film you want to make.  You can make "The Laughing Policeman" (great film) or you can make "Lethal Weapon" (great in a different way), but you can't make them both.  Otherwise, you're demanding too much from the audience.    I'm not sure what to say about James Woods.  It seems like he was a co-producer and it's clear that he exercised a great deal of control over this film.  He's an actor of great talent.  Eg. His performance in "The Onion Field" was outstanding.  And he's obviously an intelligent man.  "Cop" does him little credit, though.    
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 Do the research on the organization behind this book.  The American Association of University Women is essentially a left-wing front for extremist views about men and women.  They are a propaganga led,feminist group mascarading as an acedemic and research organization.  The saddest part of this book that is based on anecdotal evidence and "studies" largely funded by leftist and tax-payer funded grants into the "female studies departments"  in universities.  The evidence is overwhelming in the ways that schools are failing boys.  70% of honor role graduates were female in 2004.  60% of college bound graduates were female.  SO if you want to waste your time reading a politically motivated, pack of misrepresentation of facts and biased studies, then definitely get this book 
 I was seriously disappointed that there was no ST: Enterprise calendar this year, but this one is a fair substitute. Problem is, I haven't found a place to hang it up yet. Its the 'wrong way' to fit in the place where I have always hung my calendars. And, there isn't a place to write your important data on the calendar. Appointments, notes, and reminders... etc. However the ship pictures are incredible and wonderfully detailed. I'll save it for sure, as a Star Trek memento. But as a functional calendar it leaves much to be desired 
 This book is quite disappointing, and I (someone with no accounting background) find it boring and too easy--the manual for an accounting software seems more exciting than this.  I feel there is little about accounting in this book; rather, I find a huge section praising what accountants do.  I think if numbers give you a headache and you abhor math, you may consider laboring through this book.  Otherwise, try something else 
 Please, please, please, don't go near this book. It does not have any valid answers for you but will only create perpetual problems with your self and those around you. If you have problems, seek out professional help (not those with Freudian principles or suppression theories). This book can only cause more harm than good.  Sorry, but save your money 
 While some critics can argue with Dan Brown's research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing these Da Vinci "debunking" presentations will never be able to refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church, and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this "Rock" of male dominancy was built the Church.  Thank you again, Dan Brown, by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations, obscurations and lies. These obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty, insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses, and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources, worth trillions, through guilt, control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power. And those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty Dan Browns put together. People are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been Jesus' actual relationship with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive Men's Club with Jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship? To answer these questions, some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth, because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page, especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption. The next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the Vatican thrown open for public view. Lord only knows what plunder they contain 
 "When Calls the Heart" had absolutely no depth whatsoever.  The character's were one dimensional and predictable.  But, thankfully, there was hardly any religious preaching, which I was thankful for.  The chapters were very short, and were written as if they were from a child, with no meaning.  And, as always, the ending came up so quickly, and ends so abruptly.  If you're looking for a mindless read, then this is for you.  If not, then I do not recommend 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 I've been a loyal user of Systemworks (also "Utilities" & AntiVirus) for many years, frequently buying upgrades as I moved through various Windows OSs.  The latest verison (2006) has been a big disappointment.  1) The "integrator" repeatedly crashes (and "must shut down").  I was told to reintall (it took 4 hours).  Tech support (email) was slow and barely intelligible.  2) The full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system.  3) The utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years  4) The rebate (for upgrade users) came in the form of a debit card, not a check.  (What a hassle!  I don't want any more "plastic"!)  5) Turning the Norton protection off substantially speeds up my PC.  What the heck is going on back there?  During the next year, I'll be looking for a new Anti-Virus support product.  Cheers, Joh 
 If you are looking for information on Seichim and Reiki Healing, this is NOT the book for you.  It is, primarily, an advertisement for Mr. Ramsey's healing sessions and classes, including articles written about Mr. Ramsey in obscure newspapers and testimonials from three of his patients along with ads for his Seichim classes showing when, where and how much.  The poor grammar and lack of knowledge of the English language make the reading difficult.  Most noticable is that none of the titles of the newspaper articles are capitalized properly.  There is a very brief history of Seichim that lacks detail or substance.  There is no information concerning Seichim or Reiki healing methods or ideology.  The chakra information in the book is contradictory, placing chakras in the wrong order in one section and then the proper order on the next page.  Also the chakra colors are not consistant within the text, and they're back to being out of positional order again.  I guess confusing and misleading would be the best things I can say about this book.  I find it nervey that it is called a "handbook".  This book is a waste of money.  Sincerely, Bobbi Curtis  
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 I did not get this book from Amazon knowing that I was about to read what ends up as a piece of evangelistic propaganda. Such as it is, its author seems to be narrowly educated, glowing with blind enthusiam, and speedily skips over deeply problematic religious questions I doubt he has the capacity to understand. I am surprised that Hampton Roads publishes such twaddle these days. Too bad for them. Had I browsed this book in a bookstore, I would not have bought it 
 The problem with being self-righteous is that, in time, people discover you're hypocrite. Way to cheat on your wife Bill. Now, go after someone who doesn't exercise your idea of family values 
 The writeup is incorrect.  This does not fit all cuisinart 12 cup coffee makers, it definitely does not fit the dcc 1200.  While returning it is not difficult through Amazon, it means a trip to UPS and another 2 weeks of waiting for a correct replacement 
 This book is not very helpful and confusing to use. A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands. 
 Got it home put in the sim card, add the battery and changed the phone. Once it was charged I went to activate the phone, it said "insert sim". I redid several times, called support, got the run around, becaused it did not understand my error. When I got a person, she said the same thing, after 15 minutes of trying to insert a card where there was no place for a card, the lady said they would have to send me a new phone, mind was broke. So we will see if the new one is better, next week when it comes 
 Dust is the first attempt I made at a Martha Grimes novel.  Page 74 is point where I am tossing the book aside.  OK, someone was killed.  Many people knew him, although I can not remember  any of them.  Who are all these other people and what do they bring to the story?  I know this is a novel in a series, but most authors can bring a new reader up to speed fairly early in a novel.  I also can't figure out what is so important about Jury getting busy with most of the female characters.  Is it a mystery novel or a Harlequin romance?  Looks like I'll be skipping any other Richard Jury novels 
 I completely recommend this book if you like being underwhelmed, or if you want to be whipped into a catatonic stupor. If you must read it, get it from the library so you won't feel like you did when you bought the Ding King from the TV commercial. (As for the writing style, I'm not sure our president can push a subject against a predicate, at gunpoint.) If this was written by a ghostwriter, he or she should be taken out and shot.  As for the veracity of the text, don't believe it. Karen Hughs, the probable ghostwriter, called up Bush's former national guard base after he became governor, or the national guard's commander-in-chief. She told the commander she wanted to be able to check his records. Translation: I'm going to purge anything bad about him before I write his book.  George's words ring as hollow as his vaunted national guard record and his smirking heir of superiority. This book says that he continued to fly for a number of years, which was patently false. After his two million dollars worth of training, he tried to get a slot in the Air Force post office of another base in Alabama. He was turned down. Then, he refused to take his flight physical. Flight physicals are orders, not requests. Years later, Karen Hughes would tell a cowed press that Bush didn't take the physical because his personal physician was in Houston. No one questioned that these exams are given by Air Force flight surgeons, period.  This book was not only inaccurate, but dull and too self-serving. I recomment it only as a Christmas gift for a person you only pretend to like. (Don't forget to add drums and trumpets for his or her children too.) The collapse should be total.   By page 5 this book was by my bedside as a cure for insomnia. (A Charge to Sleep.) If you have a choice of painting on New Year's Eve and watching it dry, or reading this, go with the paint.   If someone gives this to you, change your home phone number. It can only mean he or she really doesn't like you.  Look for this book in a clearance bin near you.  
 I had worn out my copy of The Firm's 5-Day Abs so I thought I would try something new.  Bad decision.  There are way too many moves in a short period of time so you really don't feel one exercise before you move on to the next.  In addition, you really need to buy the "Firm Sculpting Stick" to make many of the exercises work, which I found insulting and rather marketing-minded.  I am sending this back 
 This book has no real facts and makes outstandingly stupid claims that have no basis in reality, a real waste of my time 
 I was unimpressed and also left quite uniformed on several issues concerning me. A lot of words here, the authors seem quite verbose, but the words ring empty. I would say I found it difficult to find anything I wanted to locate in this work. In all actuality there was truly nothing of substance to find. Metaphorically I was left empty handed.  
 This book is more for parents than educators, and even then I think it would mostly interest parents dealing with a child having great difficulty, academically or behaviorally. There are a few tips that could enlighten parents and teachers in general, but not enough to buy the book. Along a similar topic, I prefer work discussing the four temperaments by Tim LaHaye, although his books don't focus just on learning as this one does 
 I own and have read all of JA Jance's JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives.  I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I've read previously.  What a crashing disappointment.  I can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I'd picked up a Harlequin by mistake.  I'll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I'd much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn't think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.  This one gets a big "Aw, c'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!" from me.  For those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning.  They are worth the time and effort 
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 I have never purchased such a bunch of crap in my life.  This is the got to be the worst "Man's guide" I have ever read.  This guy has got no game to speak of and his best advice is to not drive 60 miles out of your way and get husstled out of a bunch of money by some chick.  Duh!!! [... 
 My kids were getting very frustrated with the connections of masts and hulls.  They are very poorly designed and "pressure" fit to a point where they easily pop off. Both boats - the Royal Dutchman and Black Pearl - have poor fitting. Compared to lego, the ability for parts to connect and stay connected is extremely poor.  I plan to write a letter to Mega Blocks about this quality issue 
 Very enjoyable.  I love the "old movies".  The whole family can watch and it was a pleasure to watch Barbara Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan.  Light and airy.  Great for Christmas 
 The self-righteousness of this book is annoying ("Using chemical cleansers in my home is not an option"), the new-age tone is cloying ("When I saw my midwife's face light up with joy and wonderment everytime she touched my womb... I knew she was living her soul's task"), and the sincere self-congratulation on her own wonderful, wholesome, healthful, spiritual lifestyle is irritating. But so what, I just wanted the recipes. So I skipped the seventy page long section on "the denatured foods of commerce" and tried some. I am already a vegetarian and I was looking for some good food without milk or eggs. But I was disappointed. My biggest problem was the ingredients. One example: every other recipe calls for "Vogue Vege Base" - I had never heard of it. I went to a couple of big natural food stores, and nobody in either of these had heard of it -and I live in CAMBRIDGE, MA, WHERE EVEN THE CONVENIENCE STORES HAVE NATURAL, ORGANIC FOODS!!! Another favourite ingredient is Bragg Liquid Aminos. Hijiki, sprouted wheat, brown rice syrup, agar powder, slippery elm powder, flax seeds... the list of things I don't have in my kitchen is SO long that it's overwhelming. It's not just ingredients - equipment is also a stumbing block. (Do you have a Vita-Mix Total Nutrition Center?) I did try a few things, they were only ok. Instead of this book, I recommend '150 Vegan Favorites', by Jay Solomon -easy recipes with straighforward ingredients that always turn out well 
 We used this book as the text for our Mythology class. On the outside it looks like an OK book: encompassing both classic European myths with African, Asian, and Middle Eastern myths, with generous examples from each region.  However, the stories are very poorly written; it is obvious that Mrs. Rosenberg is not an author. That's fine, stick to what you're good at, but don't mangle another classic myth, please. Her diction and syntax is very simple, and her attempts at metaphors are laughable. Plus, if I have to hear the phrase "and so it came to pass" one more time, I'm going to scream. The line must appear in each story no less than 10 times.  If you want to read up on mythology, buy translations of Homer and Ferdowsi and Goethe. If this book is assigned to you as a textbook, good luck 
 Had it not been for Nora Robert's contribution to this book, I would have rated it with no stars.  The Eve Dallas story was great as usual, however the rest of the short stories were awful.  I always read what I start but in this case I should have changed that rule.  Just awful!! 
 This is truly one the most spectacular films ever made, not suffering for having been made during the silent era. However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to 139mins as oppossed to the VHS 155mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero (Fairbanks) has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rose-tree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her (in an intimate scene) that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a let-down with those scenes missing; thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been 4 1/5 (5 stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack). You have been warned 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 I have great respect for Charles Jencks as an architect, and as a critic of art relating to such. Therefore the book should be retitled, What is Postmodern Architecture? Or what is everything about Post-Modernism except  the art? The main focus seems to be on the industrial world which created  the art, rather then the art. Seems hardly revolutionary or even relevant  since everyone and their brother and sister has written on that subject  since 1820. I was hoping for something which would address the art, but I  was sorely disappointed. The constant focus on the world around the  buildings of postmodernism dragged and was inebriatingly dull (It got to  the point where the author was forced to contradict himself to make the  book interesting). The focus of Postmoderism was once architecture,  however, now the focus has shifted, it seems everyone except the academics  know this. Not only was his sections on art and literature stupid, but  incorrect, and blunderingly light. I expected more from Jencks, being the  great mind of the century he was. If you want to know anything helpful and  relevant pretaining to Post Modernism today, do not read this book. But hey  if you want to know about your father's post modernism, read this book 
 This song just doesn't work musically. It defies every convention of general song writing (not in a good way) just look:  - No tune - No bassline - No chord progression - No defined sections (i.e. verse, bridge, chorus, middle 8)  There is that little (horribly fake) trumpet line but it isn't very catchy. So what is it that made this song number 1 for so long? I guess we'll never know.. 
 Shelley Long stars as the clutzy wife of an prominent Plastic Surgeon- when she chokes to death on a piece of chicken she is brought back to life by her ditzy sister and an occult book- with one 'catch' she must find her true love by the next full moon or return to the grave.   Frankly I was bored. Shelley longs 'clutzy' episodes were meant to be funny, but instead, I felt embarrassed for her. How many times can you watch someone knock something over or spill food before you begin to become annoyed? This movie had a dated feel and I felt the main character's helplessness and slapstick antics just didn't capture the interest of this viewer. Instead of laughing at her antics I pitied her. Not humor in my book. 1 star 
 This book was first published in 1981, but later edited and republished with a new title in 1984.  The author was clearly influenced to change the direction of this book from the first printing because of his contact with YWAM, John Dawson, Richard Twiss, Daniel Kikawa and others who are hawking these same ideas.  Any good Christian anthropologist will tell you that history shows that, though most Gentile cultures had some sort of "supreme being" they worshipped, those "supreme beings" were one god among a pantheon of gods.  The Bible is clear that "from the creation of the world" all Gentile cultures had corrupted the knowledge of the true God.  Though the first printing of this book had some good ideas about cross-cultural methods to preach the Gospel to many cultures, the additions to this book prove clearly that it is unbiblical in its basic premise.  The new title "Eternity In Their Hearts: Startling Evidence of Belief in the One True God in Hundreds of Cultures Throughout the World" is an unbiblical statement.  Why do I say that?  Two verses end Richardson's unbiblical speculations:  Eph. 2:11-13  Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of  men)-remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now inChrist Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ. Rom. 10:14-15  How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news! 
 I was recommended this movie by a friend here at college, and because he spoke so highly of it, I thought I would just buy it instead of rent it. I definitely regret that decision. If you're thinking of buying it - rent it first. It was dull and obnoxious, not to mention weird. The only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate (which is why I gave it 1 star instead of 0). However, if you're still interested, definitely rent it, you might enjoy it. 
 my disappointment in this book can only be expressed by the following blunt statement:  the purpose of this book is to enrich the author.  no benefit to the reader is evident.  I would recommend saving your pennies and looking elsewhere 
 This should be the real title.  How many people does George have to screw over before the world wakes up and realizes that this guy is just one big rat 
 Rather than resell this book, I recycled it.  This book is superficial and poorly written.  I wish I hadn't bought it.  I wonder if it were just slapped together and dumped on the market to make a quick buck.  
 Put simply, this toy doesn't work. Or I should say perhaps it would work with really good bubble solution but it does not work with the bubble solution that comes with it. It sort of sputtered some bubble solution out the top but we never got even one full bubble much less the stream of bubbles we were hoping for. Luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore didn't mind when we took it back 
 This seems to be a very typical graduate level text at most universities, but I don't think it is organized very well nor is it very readable.  First of all, the book is translated from French which probably did not help the formating and prose much.  Second the notation used in the text seemed arcane and dated.  I remember spending hours just to figure out what some of the notation was trying to convey.  I think a thorough reading of Griffiths QM book would be much more advised than trying to read this book.  However, all that being said, perhaps the book might be useful as a refrence as it is rather encyclopedic.  In summation, find a better QM book to study from than this one 
 book is just a brochure for advertising a franchise of financial advisers and broker 
 I come away from Wink's book asking myself the question, "Did Jesus have social and political change in mind when he commanded his followers to love their enemies?" I hardly think so.  At least not in the way Wink proposes.  Wink makes many good statements concerning the Christian's love and nonviolence. I enjoyed his interpretations of Jesus' examples (go two miles, turn the other cheek, etc.) However, I feel that his application is off the mark of Jesus' intended meaning. As Christians, we are not to concern ourselves with improving on the injustices of the day by beating them (worldly kingdoms) at their own game. Jesus would not, because he did not, ever shame someone into repentance. His motivation was strictly love of God and man. At times Jesus' actions toward an individual may have resulted in shame, but this was NOT his motivation.   I strongly disagree with Wink's use of "submission." He speaks of submission as if it is a weak thing to be despised. The Apostles Paul and Peter did not seem to think so.  I don't believe his understanding of "submission" is New Testament. It seems that Wink is more concerned about causing social and political change through pacifism than he is to simply 'love your enemies' as evidence that we are the disciples of Christ who manifest the Gospel by our lives (Jn. 13:34-35).   Wink uses an unbelieving Ghandi and a promiscious civil rights activist like King to reveal something of Jesus' Third Way. He also uses Bonhoeffer (of whom I am a big fan)as an example of Jesus' resistance. Bonhoeffer's writings are phenomonal... yet he compromised his faith and justified his actions of armed resistance.  This should alert the reader to a misunderstanding of the Biblical text.   Love's aim is not at temporarily changing the political oppressive systems in government by peaceful means, but at changing the heart of man for all eternity and bringing glory to God. Was Jesus motivation and purpose geared toward politcal upheaval and bringing down the evil men by love so that he might have partisan power!?  I think not!  Do we want peace on earth? Yes, but we recognize peace on earth is a very temporal thing and will never fully be Christ's peace. The "already/not yet" aspect of the Kingdom of God teaches us this.    I disagree with Wink that we should follow Jesus "as best we can." The problems are resolved when we recognize that Christ's life is in us... we must learn to walk in his Spirit and not in our flesh.  We can do nothing. Our best is no good.    I believe Wink's attempt at presenting "Jesus' Third Way" falls short of the true way Jesus presented.  If we dare say that unregenerated man can mimic the love of Christ... we pollute the Gospel's presentation and form it to fit something we can achieve in our flesh.  This kind of love is no longer supernatural... just nice... natural... and self-serving.  I recommend reading "Mere Discipleship: Radical Christianity in a Rebellious World" by Lee C. Camp after you have read Wink and see that his clever thinking only reflects one more sly attempt at getting a grip on the worldly kingdoms.  If you are looking for a book to carry around with you and one that you can share with people all over the world... try the New Testament.  I would like to suggest you not use the patriotic version or some man's interpretation of it.  Read the words of Jesus for yourself and let the Holy Spirit discern for you the motivation behind loving your enemies.  Does the love of Christ manifested by the Holy Spirit lead you to shame your enemy so you might get your way?  Let the Holy Spirit guide and counsel you to the meaning of Christ's nonsense love 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 The Da Vinci Code is a worldwide phenomenon, staying on the New York Times Bestseller List for over 2 years.  I think I'll throw together a quicky book with some alternate intepretations of biblical "history" that I got from looking up websites with Google one weekend.  I'll slap the name "Da Vinci Code" in the title of my book and market it to delusional paranoids who spend every waking minute thinking about how the arts and entertainment world is at war with Christianity. I'll make a forture off someone else's success. It sure beats working for a living!  God Bless Americ 
 Be sure you have a very flat, smooth surface for these bumper cars. There is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car. Our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway. We had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface. These are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court.  
 I recommend that any professor, intending to use this book as a teaching tool, have it translated to a language we can understand, such as english.  Why use big words when you can say what you mean very easily.  We have been  informed that we will have less than a 40% retention rate of what we've  read.  Shouldn't that tell you something 
 If you know the opera by heart, have performed it countless times, then you know that no recording is as good as the orginal 1951 recording.  I find it difficult to listen to any other.  I wish that it would be released again 
 "Sudden Death" is the second Andy Carpenter book that I've read(I was introduced to the series last year when I read 'Bury the Lead'). As with the previou book, the charaters are inteesting, well-developed and quirky without being too annoying.  The plot is the biggest problem with 'Sudden Death'. There's a lot of build-up, but very little payoff. This won't stop me from reading other entries in this series, but Rosenfelt needs to tweak things a bit. Some of the similarities to Robert B. Parker and the 'Spenser' cast are rather obvious here. Maybe Rosenfelt needs to work on finding his own 'voice' and motivation for these characters, rather than simply emulating what others have done before 
 It is so typical for soundtracks lately to leave out the best songs or scores of the film. This one is no exception! I very much wanted to hear the song that plays over the opening credits and the "Congressional Recruitment" scene. It is omitted from this otherwise great soundtrack. Studios need to start including all major works from films to make whole a "soundtrack. 
 Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one. 
 So, I bought this book thinking I was going to learn how to "open up to sexual creativity and erotic expression" but mostly what I got was "The World According to Susie."  While some of her insights were actually quite good, I found the book disjointed.  Rarely did it deliver what the title promised 
 If you want to read a great book on personal illness by a fine writer, read Reynolds Price' "A Whole New Life."  The prose is authentic and there is not a touch of pretense in it.   Styron's lack of insight into his illness is topped only by his lack of knowledge of abnormal psychology.  His declaration that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is disturbing, because it mixes cause and effect.  His assertion is tantamount to attributing global warming to melting glaciers.  Mixing cause and effect is not something one would attribte to a writer of his distinction, as it is the essence of clear thought.  Yes, the intensity and distribution of various neuro-chemicals have been found to be compromised among those suffering depression who have been tested.  But how are they compromised?  Contrary to the author's belief that "the madness results from an aberrant biochemical process," and that "such madness is chemically induced," it is the commonly-held view today that psychology plays the decisive causitive role in mental illness, as that psychology is formulated and developed throughout life, and is influenced by situations, including loss, misuse of drugs and alcochol, and unconscious dilemmas, among others.   That an organic etiology has been surmised in many cases of schizophrenia and other psychosis, as well as in profound obsessions, certainly "rules in" brain damage, whether it is evident at birth, or the result of other physical and emotional trauma later in life; but it does not rule out psychology and the higher order mental functions we attribute to consciousness.       
 There are a few quite good letters here, but many of them appear to have been selected either because the writer was famous or the editor was just desperate to fill the book. Nearly all of them are from before WW2 and most are from before the 20th century. As a result, most of the letters have language that would seem very stilted if used today. But even old age doesn't excuse the writing that in some cases made me cringe 
 This is my 3rd PD James book and I have to say I was quite disappointed.  (The other 2 were Murder Room and A Certain Justice.)  I found most of the characters to be not terribly believable and one dimensional.  Even Dalgliesh was not well drawn.  And to make it worse, the plot was not believable.  I agree with someone else who said borrow this from the library, don't buy it. 
 If this were a satirical view of Regency books, I might have bought the far-fetched storyline, the flat, idiotic characters, and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot.  As I rather suspect it is not a satire - Catherine Coulter being a best-selling Romance novelist - it was disappointing to say the very least.  I only, I repeat, only listened to it in its entirety because I hadn't brought anything else to listen to at work one day.  If you like historical romance that's fun and funny, try Katie MacAlister's book "Improper English", or for some more serious historical fiction, check out Phillippa Gregory's Wideacre series 
 There's a reason you never heard of this one. It's so bad that--sitting all alone--I was too embarrassed to watch it through.  I'll bet that none of the participants (there were no "actors") includes this one on their resume. Talk about low budget.  Writers were apparently somebody's third grade class.  And the "music"--if there's a hell for lyricists it's full of the song writers from this one. Painful, truly, awfully painful.  Poor Rosie Clooney must have been chained to this by some tough legal  knots 
 Synopsis: Adrienne Cope and Jeffrey Duran are drawn into a web of intrigue and recovered memories as they both look into the death of Adrienne's sister and Jeffrey's psychiatric patient, Nico. They discover an international conspiracy and the drama ensues.  My review:  This book was pretty boring for the first 168 pages - that's when stuff finally started to get moving - 1/3 of the way through the book. I'd have dropped it long before that except that I'd alread read 'The Genesis Code' by this author and enjoyed it and was waiting for this one to improve. I really was disappointed.  I give this book 2 stars. I would have given it a slightly better score but I know the author can do much better than thi 
 I loved the early M*A*S*H episodes.  Equally intelligent, humane, cynical, sardonic, and just right out hilarious, they were some of the best television ever produced.  Unfortunately, the show moved away from this formula (which worked amazingly well) to the latter day formula.  The show became overly preachy, annoying, incredibly sanctimonious, politically correct, badly acted, badly written, pretentious, and downright silly at times.  The show ran for 11 seasons, and with all sitcoms that run too long, it quickly ran out of juice.  But that doesn't excuse the poor quality of the shows from 1975 onwards.  Hawkeye and BJ's characters became incredibly annoying, especially Hawkeye and his constant flirting with nurses.  It was funny early on, but as he aged, it became more and more childish.  Alda's acting is way over the top in these later seasons.  Since he was the one running the show for all intended purposes, I suppose no one told him to tone it down.  Charles is really the only intelligent and sympathetic character here, and the one I like the most.  You're not supposed to like him because of his "blue blood" upbringing, but you do anyway, because Hawkeye and BJ are so damn irritating.  You would think that BJ and Hawkeye wouldn't be so naive sometimes about things, considering they've been in a war now for years.  Soldiers are very jaded, cynical people, and with good reason.  They don't get more naive as time progresses.  The early episodes had Hawkeye much more jaded than in these later ones, and it should be the other way around.  Watch the first 3 seasons (except when Henry gets killed, which was just done for cheap shock value).  Those were the best... 
 Don't buy this!  I regret that I didn't listen to the people who left feedbacks.  The craftmanship for this item is very bad.  Not only the product was made of cheap plastic, it was missing a screw too.  I would not recomment this product 
 I purchased this book when I got my first pressure cooker, and I was unimpressed.  First, the general discussion of pressure cooking isn't that detailed, but most of all, the title of the book is misleading - I thought that I was getting a book with "general" recipes - but the book is limited to just mediterranean recipes.  The book cover does not reveal that the recipes are limited to such recipes, and I think that it should.  Had I opened the book and paged through it, I would not have purchased this volume 
 I started reading this book, skipping the introduction and then realized this isn't the Tao Te Ching at all. This is just what some guy wishes the tao te ching said, and so he wrote his own version. It turns out the author admits this in the introduction. I wish I had known that bit of information before purchasing this piece of junk. I guess I should have taken the hint with the "A New Version" doublespeak on the front cover. Sigh. I usually give away old books to friends and relatives but this one is going straight in the trash where it belongs.      
 ...essentially you get what you pay for. This book is certanly NOT representative of what I have come to expect from National Geographic.   I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book, but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best. Most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish. In the past I've found photographs by professionals like Steve McCurry ('Portraits')visually arresting. Not so here.  At least it only cost me $20 oredering from Amazon. If I had been able to preview it beforehand, I would not have thought it worth even the discounted price 
 Very tedious, always refers to other examples, bad problems, unfriendly, unclear, no quality contro 
 Unfortunately, the answers it posits to those questions fail the test of logic, for the most part.  (Okay, here I go again, sabotaging my reviewer rating by stating an opinion that many people will object to.)  It makes a case, and a very good one, that the evidence in the Kennedy assassination has been hopelessly bungled. And I'll admit that it's difficult to swallow the concept that that much evidence has been handled that poorly by accident; it's tempting to assume that if the evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone is consistently so flawed, he must not have, and the botched evidence trail must be the work of a massive conspiracy and coverup.  But that conclusion doesn't NECCESARILY follow; none of the botched evidence actually PROVES anything other than that there were incompetents thick on the ground in 1963, and that is certainly true (as is the fact that there are still incompetents thick on the ground in 2005; it's a fact of life: people are stupid) regardless of how Kennedy was killed, or by who. Whether one chooses to believe that it's more likely that there was massive stupidity in all aspects of the case, or that there has been a massively successful conspiracy, is largely a matter of personal taste; as Ronald S. White points out in this book's Postscript, there is insufficient evidence to conclusively answer that question either way.  But consider: if you were the head of a conspiracy to asassinate the president back in 1963, would you choose to do so in a crowded, massively public setting with hundreds of witnesses? Unlikely; there'd be many more attractive opportunities, especially if you had government connections. But if you were a single nutcase with a gun, and this was likely to be your only opportunity to get within shooting range of the president, obviously, that question doesn't apply. Of course, it's POSSIBLE that the plan was to use Oswald as an assassin, and/or frame him for the killing, and so one had to accept the setting in which he could plausibly have had opportunity. But then, the conspiracy theories almost all posit additional gunmen scattered around the area, presumably there to finish the kill if Oswald missed. But if you're going to have to use other gunmen anyway, why bother with an agent as undependable as Oswald at all? Clearly, if this was a conspiracy to kill the president, it was a stupid and incompetent one; itself not an unreasonable hypothesis (as I said, people are stupid, and that certainly potentially includes conspirators) but if the conspiracy is stupid and unsubtle enough to have chosen to kill the president in public with an agent as incompetent as Oswald, thus requiring backup firepower and the requisite amount of coverup to hide that backup firepower from discovery, AND far-reaching and powerful enough to have done so, with sufficient pull in the media and law-enforcement to squash any discovery and/or revelation of these facts, WHY are the people writing for this book still alive? Wouldn't it have been trivially easy to kill them and/or suppress their work without ever letting it see print? Yet that hasn't happened, and while it's possible to posit a sufficiently subtle conspiracy that would realize that allowing some inconclusive claims on the subject would tend to cause people to make the very argument Im making, thus discrediting the whistle-blowers without the need for killing them, it is impossible (at least in my mind) to imagine that a conspiracy clever enough to do that would have been stupid enough to kill the president in public in the first place.   Further, we're supposed to believe that a conspiracy smart enough and widespread enough to get its hands on the Zapruder film almost immediately and to be able to edit it before re-releasing it, could and would edit it so badly that amateur photography buffs would be able to spot the fabrication; if they were good enough to lay hands on the film, and capable of editing it, doesn't it seem likely that they'd have been aware of the limitations of their editing, and if so, wouldn't they have simply destroyed the film and "lost" it, without ever letting it be seen again? Probably, although it's possible that this is again simply a case of "people are stupid", but it simply seems to me that I'm being expected to accept the hypothesis of a conspiracy that is at once supremely clever and subtle (so that only the authors are clever enough to uncover hints of it) while at the same time stupid enough to leave evidence behind that (as in the case of the autopsy x-rays, as described by David W. Mantik, Ph.D., who established that his young daughter could do so) a five-year old could spot it.  I admit it; it's possible. But I find it easier to believe that the trail of evidence was corrupted by incompetent handling at all points than to believe in a massive, incredibly clever, incredibly stupid, un-subtle and bungling conspiracy which has nonetheless managed to keep at least an official lid on the truth for 40+ years 
 This guy is a serious jerk.  Don't buy this book and support his cause -- which is anti-everything-decent.  Buy Al Franken's book on him instead -- much more accurate and interesting 
 You'd think the qualifications for writing a Delphi book would be 1) you must be a Delphi expert 2) you must write well.  Well, I can tell you for sure that this guy doesn't meet either qualification.  This is, without question, the worst programming book I have ever had the misfortune to buy.  Ayres writes like a third grader.  And the code is even worse.  A person who'd never seen Delphi before could write this code.  It is mostly warmed over MSDN example code converted to Pascal.  Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to publish something like this.  It's that bad 
 Try "Sam and the Lucky Money" for a good story and an accurate portrayal of life in SF Chinatown 
 This book is several things.  One thing it is NOT is funny.  Blount  worries that, having attained the age of 55, he is experiencing some sort  of humorist's change of life and is no longer capable of evoking guffaws.   Well, then, this book is a self-fulfilling prophesy.  In the process, we  get to squirm through such incessent dissing of his mother that we want to  turn our heads in embarrassment; so much what-did-I-do-wrong whining about  lost loves that we're inclined to "card" him to see if he's  really past 15; and yet more tired and feeble attempts at what, I suppose,  is to pass for "Southern humor."  If this is the best we're to  expect from Blount as he flounders through middle age, he ought to confine  himself to his periodic appearances with Garrison Keillor, reading jokes  sent in by people who know what "funny" really is 
 Half way through I'm wondering if I want to finish this turkey.  And that's disappointing.  I really did like Stepsister.  I also believe Wicked is a stand alone work of art!  I recommend it to anyone I meet.  I love Mr. Maguire's twists on classic fairy tales.  I hope he's not being forced by the "powers that be" (publishing companies) to crank them out quicker than he is comfortable doing.  I'm sure it took a long time for him to create Wicked and fill in all those gaps and answer all those questions!  No stone was left unturned.  Perhaps he even had some of the questions already answered in his mind for "confessions'" Cinderella and Stepsister?  It just doesn't seem that Mirror Mirror is as well put together and researched as the others.  Therefore, it seems a little disjointed --- lacking in flow.  It also seemed like an awful lot of writing just for the sake of meeting a minimum word count.  I do hope Mr. Maguire has more time (or whatever else he needs ) in order to produce another Wicked.  Perhaps we, as readers, should also coinsider Wicked as a singualar work of art by this artist and not compare everything he writes against that benchmark?  Just an idea 
 Listening to the Audible version, I want to yell, "Get to the point!!" McClellan seems to have a particular grudge against his ex-boss Clark, and it detracts from the credibility of everything he says. Were they lovers? He also seems to be trying very hard to stretch his limited facts out into a book-length story. The result is rambling nonesense. Maybe he really knows something, but it's hard to tell. It all keeps coming back to how evil his former boss is.   Stop wasting my time, Barr. Perhaps your son Scott McClellan could evade the point for a living as the White House Press Secretary, but we are paying you to get to the point.  Oh well. My fault for expecting more. Skip this garbage. Bush Sr. and Cheney did IT for their Swiss Bank owners. That's all you need to know. We're all doomed 
 The premise of the book -- scientists trying to contact the near past in order to divert environmental disaster -- is interesting.  The premise and the alternate version of the present might have even been fascinating except that the ideas are overwhelmed by much too much text, unnecessary plot developments, incredibly boring detail, and characters you don't much care about.  Of all the many, many books I've read in my life, I have purposely not finished only a very few -- but this was one of them.  I was just too disinterested to continue reading 
 This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever TRIED to read.  I really honestly tried to get past the first chapter, but I kept falling asleep.  The story was dumb and went no where.  It kept moving around and I couldn't keep up with it.  The characters were pretty much dopey too 
 This got to be the most egotistical and arrogant book ever writted. The author in about every paragraph, uses words like "I", "me" and when refering to another person and himself, he always puts his name first. Bhagwati loves to name drop, he lists people he has met as if its a popularity contest. Bhagwati's writting will confuse you and annoy you. Throught out the book he loves to advertise the papers and studies he has written, they have no relavence to the topic at hand except maybe to help him sell more books 
 Just got this in the mail. I pre-ordered it with high expectations. Boy was I wrong. In short: Nothing new. Nothing unique. Nothing gained.   My advice -- and I've read them all: exercise, eat right, do crosswords, and SAVE YOUR MONEY 
 I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.  Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.  It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book 
 A how-to book for reading the future is a product that has had universal appeal for people.  Since ancient times, people have sought to use various methods to gain an advantage, to know what others are thinking and what the future will hold.  Unfortunately, there is no such thing as psychic abilities, and all the wishing and hoping in the world, and all the how-to books that one reads will not change that.  Once people thought they could tell the future by reading the entrails of animals, and by judging how birds were flying.  Now there are a whole new set of fantasies.  One thing, though - at least this one doesn't claim to be speaking to the dead relatives of her fans 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Moore can write -- well enough to keep the pages turning and to show that she has a brain. But I think she's squandered her talents with this book. The purported "eroticism" isn't much more than uninspired pornography, and the "thrill" is pretty much nonexistent, with an ending that is easy and not particularly surprising in the way that a good, intelligent crime/mystery is when it rises above its genre. The narrator is so detached and flat that it's hard to know or feel much about her -- and while that persona may have been Moore's attempt to reflect her ultimate ending (which I won't give away here), the end did not justify the means. I was annoyed that I had to endure a gruesome scene with no payoff, and that I wasted my time reading this book at all when I could have been reading something much more original, complex, and interesting. Not recommended 
 All Covey is saying in his longwinded book, basically, is this: Listen to the people you love. Put the family first in all your decisions. Blah blah blah and something about synergy.  The writing is horrible, and the metaphors are overused. I also dislike Covey's plagiarizing material from the Bible and not acknowledging where he gets his "inspiration".  In one passage he equates the Bible and other books of scripture with "Chicken Soup For the Soul" as "wisdom literature".  Despite being a supposed devout Mormon himself, obviously he's afraid to mention the Book of Mormon in that passage. Perhaps he's afraid of scaring away potential pigeons--I mean, readers.   This was a book my book club decided to read; otherwise I'd have never even tried to get past the first few pages. I wonder how a man who is on the road more often than not can really interact with his own family and give "us", the poor ignorant masses, advice on our own families. In one passage he even says that other people's advice may not apply to our own situations. Then how can he expect us to take his advice?   Don't waste your money. If you absolutely must read it, get it from the library. Covey doesn't need your money, he has a huge house with a basketball court and indoor pool. He's doing fine. 
 I discarded the DVD after watching it. If you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home don't buy this version of The Secret Garden. 
 I bought this book to help me build my own web page.  I learned how to follow their directions to build a fictional webpage.  When it came time to build my own, however, I was at a loss.  The exercises were easy to follow, but if your information or needs are different this book is really not of much help.  I do have a nice website for their fictional company... now I need to purchase another book to build a website for my own 
  "One Deadly Night" may be the most unusual true crime tale this reviewer has read.  This is entirely due to the fact that author Glatt, or his publisher, rushed ODN to print far too soon. The following will attempt to justify that charge: David Camm was a former Indiana State Trooper. He may have been a fine cop but it appears he was anything but a good husband or a nice guy. (There are no crimes attached to those personal shortcomings!).  One evening in September 2000, Camm's wife and two children were murdered in the garage of their New Albany, Indiana home.  The setting is a Louisville suburb, not a remote town in the cornfields.  ODN is told mostly from a prosecutorial viewpoint.  The investigating State Police fingered DC as the perp from the very outset. Virtually no effort was made, at least within the pages of ODN, to identify another suspect or accomplice.  This reader had the suspicion that Camm made enemies among his fellow troopers while still in uniform and was receiving some serious payback.  It is almost meaningless that that DC is found guilty of murder only to have that conviction overturned. What happened next? My amazon friends have 2 choices in securing an answer: 1) Do a web search on David Camm to be bought up to date as of March 7, 2006.  2) Wait until the case has COMPLETELY wound its' way through the legal system. Perhaps then author Glatt will produce a comprehensive-and FINAL! - story on the events of that "deadly Indiana night" of September 2000. In that forthcoming final version, one hopes the author will shed light on the urgency to rush a garden variety, uncompelling murder case into print. Judging by the reprint history ODN is selling well but promoting an unresolved case is plainly and simply misleading. For the moment, ODN is not recommended to my amazon friends.  
 This is the American version of the greatest hits, which means its not as good. I suggest you get Singles of the 90's over this. I only gave this 2 stars cuz of "Life is a flower" and "C'est la vie", i really like those songs otherwise i would have given it a zero.  1. Life is a flower (10/10) the original version of "Whenever you're near me", released outside of America only. I love this version, it has pure euro-pop all over it but is a great song. the chorus rocks.  2. C'est la vie (8/10) Good song, not the best but still good.  3. Always have always will (7/10) Good song, sounds sorta like a christmas tune.   4. Lucky love (Acoustic version)(5/10) the original is the best. i dont like this version much.  5. Lucky love (Dance mix) (0/10) the song "Living in danger" is taken from this song. listen to the two and you'll see. i dont like this version either cuz its bland.  6. Beautiful life (remix) (0/10) Long and boring  I suggest you get singles of the 90's over this trash. dont even buy this 
 The game plan in Mark Burnett's hit reality TV show The Apprentice is to ruthlessly eliminate 15 of its 16 contenders, in its bid to identify the best man or woman for the top job in one of billionaire Donald Trump's corporations. In the event, it sheds light on the ways and means Trump, estimated by Forbes to be worth US$1.74bil (RM6.6bil), and the likes of him may have undertaken on the warpath to building their own business empires.   The contenders are divided into two teams: Protege and Versacorp, where they are expected to compete against the rival team and against members of their own team for leadership posts while maintaining teamwork throughout 15 frenetic episodes.   They are thus put through a series of tests to gauge their team leadership skills, competitive spirit, business acumen, passion, gumption and more. These tests have included an advertising campaign for a card that allocates private jet service by the hour, an AIDS benefit auction, art exhibition, running a lemonade stand and selling bottled drinking water.    Although Trump appears only at the end of each episode to eliminate one person from the losing team - and briefly at the start - he really is the star of the show which is an induction into his world. Choosing his apprentice by shrewdly assessing their strengths and weaknesses, with the help of assistants George and Carolyn, Trump cuts a clear picture of the type of person that will fit in his world.    According to Parinello, a Wall Street Journal bestselling author, and Gottfried, a regular columnist for The Apprentice on www.the-trades.com, the ideal candidate will be familiar with all or most of these 10 Trump-approved methods:   Think Big. Show the Competition No Mercy. Defend Yourself Aggressively. Remember, Consensus Is Overrated. Identify All Possible Resources, and Use Them Strategically. Cut Your Losses. Get Face-to-Face With Key Decision-Makers. Step Up - Take Intelligent Chances, and Then Take Responsibility. Advance the Most Profitable Deal. Negotiate Tough.    Employers look for people who dare go after a riskier but more potentially rewarding path, who will pull through more often than not. These are what Trump calls Big Thinkers. The apprentice will have to be this and much, much more.   The apprentice will have to be able to Show the Competition No Mercy. He does this by identifying and neutralising competition - both outside and inside. He recognises there will be team-mates who are not above stealing his ideas or credit for his work, or sabotaging his ambitions.   If things take a turn for the worse and they sometimes do, the apprentice will Defend Himself Aggressively. It doesn't matter whether he is right or wrong, what matters is that he steps up and defends himself aggressively. How he tackles false charges and inaccuracies will be perceived as a measure of his fighting spirit.   The problem with group-think is that the watered down solution that is agreeable to everyone is rarely often the best solution, that Consensus is Overrated - so, when in a leadership position, his team cannot come to a compromise, he takes what he thinks is the best idea and runs with it.   Being able to Identify All Possible Resources and Use Them Intelligently, especially non-cash resources like getting things one needs without paying full price for them, ingenious methods of attracting potential customers, getting people to work for free, goes a long way to aiding continual business survival. The apprentice recognises this and uses the resources to his advantage.   And if things somehow don't work according to plan, the apprentice will Cut His Losses, and move on. In a leadership position, these include reshuffling a team, changing a design, approach or product line and firing someone. Continuing with something or someone that is not working is a waste of resources, time and energy.   To win over a position or a business, the apprentice will Get Face-to-Face with Key Decision Makers as often as possible, and make his case with passion and style. Non verbal communication counts and face time will give him the chance to feel out his contact's distinct way of interacting with the world. More importantly, he will get to bond with that person.   Failure comes with the territory but the apprentice knows how to Step Up - Take Intelligent Chances, and Then Take Responsibility. He recognises the right risks as the ones that present the possibility of a high payoff, have manageable downsides, take advantage of his demonstrated strengths and resources and neutralises his competition.   In any business situation, the apprentice knows that he only has a certain number of hours to work on it, so it makes sense to Advance the Most Profitable Deal. Business propositions that can't be expected to realistically deliver a minimum level of profit are a dime a dozen - he recognises those.    The apprentice will Negotiate Tough but flexibly, remembering every negotiating partner is different, thus no two negotiations will be alike. So, he researches beforehand, adapts his strategy to the person he is talking to, pushes when he can and walks away when he should.    The TV series is dramatic and addictive for its soap-opera-like quality, the way knives are constantly being hurled into the backs of rivals, metaphorically of course.    The authors of this book appear to have cleverly gleaned the lessons from the series - presumably towards good profit. So that after the show ends, you can still hold in your hands the book, 10 Secrets I Learned from The Apprentice, to be referred to again and again in quieter moments.     
 UGH! This book was awful - even for a summer beach read. I would not waste my time again on this book. Cute concept, cute characters, but zero plot. BORING! 
 The ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book.  It was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real Ludlum books 
 Why did they not republish the first edition that tasted of strawberries  and cheese. This new version, with it's claims of a "lighter  nuttier" taste, is plain awfu 
 Who cares?  My wife and I sat through disk one, and were done with the series. We just didn't care. The only thing that was really interesting were the comedy commercials for various funerial gear in the first episode. After that, they disappeared. What's the point of taking the best part of the show and removing it?  So we really need another soap opera? Seems the only marginally original aspect to this one is that one brother is in the closet, even though very few people seem to be fooled--and any that are, are also terminally clueless. Ok, the show is set arround a funeral home. Slightly different, but they don't really make it all that interesting either.  The petty squabbles and such really don't do anything for us. Don't know why the show ever built up any acclaim, because there's nothing in the first 3 episodes that makes me want to watch any more 
 Well, I just received Gavin Lambert's book on Natalie Wood, and after trudging through this monotonous, overblown biography, the conclusion is as follows: it's boring as hell!  (I can't say I haven't been warned). This is the "wonderful" biography of Natalie that is supposed to set the record straight?  It boasts 78 photos, but instead of being included in a glossy pictures section, they are widespread on various pages in the book so that they appear grainy.  It seems to me that it was written as a rebuttal, and to paint Lana Wood as a greedy, vicious person (she was obviously not interviewed), and to make childish slaps at her, when she was not given the opportunity to tell her side of it.   Robert Wagner seems threatened by anyone who knew Natalie before he, Lambert and Mart Crowley did - dismissing all of the people Natalie befriended before who offered their insights in "Natasha: The Biography Of Natalie Wood" as vultures who barely made her aquaintance and who are weaving fantasies about her.  Basically, Wagner is uncomfortable with the aspects of Natalie's life that he was not involved in.  It doesn't really attempt to get behind Natalie's persona any, like "Natasha" did, and of course, it doesn't acknowledge Natalie's love for Jimmy Williams, her first boyfriend, the rape by a famous actor, or what happened on the night of her death, hastily tying up loose ends and making her death sound so simple.  Lambert wrote this book for Wagner, there's no question, and Natasha and Courtney are hardly mentioned at all.  Did Lambert actually do any in-depth research?  As well, there are allegations that Nick Gurdin may not have been Natalie's or Lana's father, and then there's Natasha Lofft, who has not proven with DNA that she is actually Natalie's half sister, but Wagner and the girls have no problem believing that she is, but they dismiss Suzanne Finstad's book as speculation and trash? I'll believe this claimant's story when I see proof! At least Finstad was able to remain somewhat objective and unbiased, since she did not know Natalie (and she did try to get Wagner's input, but he refused) which is obviously not the case with this pathetic attempt at a so-called "definitive" biography. Much of the book appears to be written quickly, but at least it does name the film Natalie turned down, which was reputed to have the actor who raped her in the cast.  And of course, it has to dispel all the allegations of Wagner's sexual orientation, and what played the role in the demise of his first marriage to Natalie.  As much of a disappointment as this book is, I'm glad I purchased it so I can compare it to "Natasha" and Lana's book to try to decipher what is closer to the truth.  At least I didn't have to spend too much money on it!  Whatever the truth, I hope that Natalie is at peace. 
 I support the other comment made by a poster: Editor, where were you when this book was written? The writing is so terrible. Maybe .37 is too much for this book actually 
 I have read several books by Nelson DeMille and have enjoyed them.  Night Fall was a good story, but had an absolutely terrible ending.  The ending ruined the book for me.  I love the character John Corey 
 Alright. So I had intended to see this movie upon its release way back and just really never got to it. A week or so ago it was playing on Oprah's Oxygen network and I was very happy that I would finally be able to see it. Overall, it was alright. So then it was on again the next day and I couldn't stomach watching it again.  It may be called Brown Sugar, but the plot moves slower than molasses. It is way too predictable and sweet, with very little substance. It wasn't even all too interseting the first time around and I couldn't stand seeing it a second time. There's a reason why these movies are on TV, people. No need to purchase the DVD. As soon as I saw it once, I had gotten my dose and wanted no more 
 I have not written the exam yet. Before deciding on which books to use, I read the reviews, and then checked them for validity.  I have:-  -Sybex 70-291 (was given it) -MS Press 70-291 -Sybex Mastering Windows Server 2003 (Mark Minasi) -Exam Cram 2 (so as not to get caught out by silly MS tricks!)  This Sybex 70-291 is horribly lacking. 40 pages on RRAS and 40 pages on DNS. Are they for real????  You need to spend a load of time on studies for this exam... working your way through every aspect and click of this server before thinking of paying your exam fee cash. Understanding what you're doing is key to not looking like a plumb when the boss says, "Hey, set us up a secure VPN quick, Jack!"  There's no reason to fail it at all, so don't buy crap books like this one to assist in the failure stats. You have made it this far, so you have the ability to get this down, don't punish yourself by wasting time on something that is filled with verbose gibberish and repetition to fill up white space just so James Chellis and his merry bandits can sell a book. Cover to cover, it's 500 pages of waffle, but regurgitated and put through the machine backwards.  ...whilst Mark Minasi's book is 1750 odd pages of "Forget what you've been told by Granny Sybex's late great grandpa, This is how it really works!"  Your choice though.. 
 This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read (listened to).  I was never able to find a plot, and even though no one ever had sex in the book, everyone was always thinking about it and wanting to.  Not very realistic.  And, sorry, Jonathan Morosz, but the narration couldn't have gotten any more monotone 
 I have never written a book review before for Amazon, but felt I needed to save other readers from this book.  It started out just fine, but started to get plain silly and ridiciulous by the half way mark. By the time I approached the end I forced myself to finish and I should not have. It was a waste of my time. Please believe the readers who have given this book a poor review before me 
 I had to read this book for school and it was really boring! I mean, who cares about him climbing mountains? I reccomend this book for boys and not girls. It's a confusing book also. Where are his friends? Blueboy can't talk! Alright, it was OK. 
 One editor review on the back of Landscape of Lies likens it to the DaVinci Code. This is like comparing weak tea to a cup of espresso! This book has none of the depth or tightly developed characters, twists or plotlines of the DaVinci Code.   The dialog and storyline is forced and contrived. Some of the plot developments are ludicrous in their unbelievability. I heartily concur with the other amazon.com reviewer who referred to the tiresome gimmick of the cigars.  Another very annoying habit the author gave our male lead (I guess to try to give him a little personality) is to have him put the word "bloody" in the middle of other words, i.e., imbloodypossible," or "eubloodyreka."  The book felt very shallow and one-dimensional to me. I didn't care about the characters and couldn't ever get very caught up in the storyline. More than anything else I am pretty disbloodygusted for not following my initial instinct and putting the book down after the first 50 or 60 pages when I knew there was just no "there" there 
 This is currently a required reading for ERAU.  The author is very knowledgable; however, he needs a better editor.  It is difficult to decipher the author's meaning at times due to his tendencies to ramble. 
 There are numerous factual errors that have been refuted in numerous places and unfortunately the author takes potshots and makes false accusations and individuals who are dead and unable to refute his charges.  If you want to read this fine, just remember that even though it's in print doesn't make it true or accurate 
 The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor.  That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on 
 My wife bought this for our daughter for christmas several years back and frankly it is a terrible book. This coming from a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. It basically has no story or interesting plot at all. The purpose of the book is just to have a bunch of tongue twisters just to have them there. I really was surprised how bad this book was since I love so many other Dr. Seuss books (our child has at least 15 other seuss books we love). Honestly, my child picks this book periodically for bed time stories, and my wife and i will cringe when reading this. Also, our child doesn't really seem to care for it either. 
 The Premise: Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is travelling home on the last flight of the night (the red eye) to Miami where she lives and works as a hotel manager for a prestigeous hotel after attending the funeral for her late grandmother. Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) is a mysterious and charming stranger she meets in the airport who as it turns out is not so coincidentally taking the same flight as she is.  Rippner's reason for travel is strictly business. It so happens an assassination is planned on the Secretary of Homeland Security while he stays at Lisa's hotel. Rippner needs Lisa to call the hotel and arrange for the Secretary to stay in a different room. If she doesn't comply, he has a man waiting outside her fathers home to kill him.  Thoughts: This was one of my few experiences with Wes Craven's (Director) work who is most known for the horrible genre of teenage slasher films I despise. I had dismissed this film in theatres without giving a second thought, and when I finally saw it last night I knew next to nothing of what it was about. From what I vaguely remembered of the previews, and given Craven's reputation, I was honestly expecting Rippner to be a supernatural character such as a vampire. In hindsite, I think 'Vampire on a Plane' woulda been a much better foundation for a film.  To call this film's premise shaky is as kind as it is unfair. It's unfair because the core plot points could prove to be an interesting thriller. The problem with this film is how it executes those points. A hotel manager? The Secretary of Homeland Security? Give me a break! Make it the Deputy Director of the FBI and the President of the United States and we have a plotline that warrants all of this hullabaloo. The concept of this film has potential, but how it was staged is just too ridiculous. Are we really to believe that the Secretary of Homeland Security is that important that such an elaborate scheme to assassinate him would be put in place. Are we really to believe that the only way this assassination (which involves missles did I tell you? I won't say anymore) can be pulled off is if the manager of the hotel can get the Secretary to stay in a different room? And who are these nameless caucaisions who want the secretary killed? And why?  The premise isn't only shaky, it's totally gutless. It sickens me that Hollywood is so afraid of offending anyone that neither the antagonist nor their motives can in any way reflect real world people, situations or beliefs. It forces me to recall the debacle of the last adaptation of the great Jack Ryan thrillers by Tom Clancy, The Sum of all Fears. In that film, instead of having militant muslim terrorists acquire a nuclear warhead lost by Isreal (which truly is something to fear), they decided to go with Nazi's. Heaven forbid we offend all the militant muslim terrorists of the world by portraying them as the evil stain on humankind that they are. I digress. My point is simply that Red Eye doesn't even go that far. It has no voice. It doesn't tell us anything, and worse, it's too spineless to put a face on fear.  There are some good things about the film. First and foremost is the cast. While Rachel McAdams is completely not believable as a manager of a prestigious Miami hotel, that part of her character is more of sidenote and it's a fault of casting more than her acting anyway. Cillian Murphy is very talented, and he has a look that allows him to come off as charming one moment and creepy the next. I still wish he woulda turned out to be a vampire though. Finally we have the legendary Brian "Better than Anthony Hopkins as Hannible Lector" Cox. He's such a great actor, but in this film he's relegated to the most menial of roles. Almost every scene he's in is him answering the phone, being woken up by the phone, or picking up the morning paper.  The film is ok in it's first two acts, with the second act being the strongest part of the film where Rachel and Cillian have performances confined mostly to their seats on the plane. It's here that the tension builds, and the performances really hold the scenes. Then comes the third act were the film just breaks down in to complete ludicrousness. The story continues off the plane and gives up completely on being an intellectual thriller. Instead it goes for the action route and follows just about every cliche for a movie of this type.  The Verdict: Red Eye has an interesting idea that could have beened turned into something a lot better under a more able screenwriter and director. The actors performances do the best they can to keep this ship afloat. If you can ignore the ridiculous parts of this film which are about as far fetched as your typical network TV thrillers, then you may find some enjoyment your first time through. It's not horrible, but neither is it really good 
 cases very cheaply made. Break when opening. Not worth shipping cost waste of money 
 The teacher who teaches this is an enviromentalist wacko and this book can be used solely for that purpose 
 There is a rumour and large number of Interviews, he wants to realize his long dream to be the very first blackguy in the main role of James Bond 007. As a Rapper his talent is acceptable, although he does not actually always do a good Rap albums what every youngster believes nowadays.   But as a smart british Agent 007 and his dream as the first blackguy in the James Bond-movies ?? I believe, the late author Ian Flemming will be rising up again from his grave and finds no peace.   
 I really wanted to like this book.  And I did find a lot of value, but it seemed more like a handbook you would get when attending a seminar to accompany the presentation.  Perhaps that is what the authors intend 
 John R. Barry (another Digital Communications textbook author) first introduced me to this text.  And Mr. Barry, as with many com. theory persons I've met since (GTRI in Atlanta, GA; MITRE along around the Boston area of MA; Northrup in El Segundo, CA; Intersil in Palm Bay/Melbourne, FL) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs.  Essentially, it's their Bible.  The only problem is that the values and beliefs in Proakis, especially from an engineering perspective, are very third rate.  Trying to use this text in a classroom situation, especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor, is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective.  John R. Barry, for example, is a very good baby-sitter and a so-so mathematician (he couldn't be otherwise as a faculty member of Georgia Tech).  But as an engineer, John R. Barry, as with the other followers of Proakis, compares very unfavorably (in fact, I don't consider Barry an engineer; I consider him a phony that should be removed from the ECE faculty of GATECH; the department's economic fortunes would be far better if he were moved into some kind of adjunct English/Mathematics Faculty or just shipped off to some research laboratory without any students to harm [i.e., vampirically mind f--k them and then kindly provide them with werewolfic deliverance (yes, I mean along the lines of the 1972 movie with Jon Voight [Angelina Jolie's Dad] and Burt Reynolds)]...any place where truth/reality aren't so important).  There are far, far better communications engineers out there than John R. Barry [infinitely better to be precise].  And what makes these others better [others meaning real engineers; John R. Barry being a make-believe "engineer"] is not mathematical ability, memorized knowledge, or even rhetorical shrewdness, but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts; something a follower of Proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility.    In fact, the values and beliefs in the Proakis text seem to promulgate not only  Intellectual Abuse, but also a Spiritual sort as well. In a nation (where Steven Pinker, who like Proakis is of Harvard Fame, has noted) that has around 75% of its population esentially believing in the biblical/torah-related account of things, this kind of Spiritual abuse can be very dangerous indeed and lead to serious consequences.  Though it may not be intentional, nevertheless, the values and beliefs of Proakis's text and those of its instructors tend to be extremely spiritually abusive.  These values and these beliefs somehow set up a massive cognative dissonance with many student's own biblical/torah-related values and beliefs.  The result is almost always a broken-spirit.  From an economic perspective, this is bad. Very bad. And it should be stopped by no longer using this text or any like it.  Most of the "engineers" now being "developed" by the followers of Proakis (e.g., John R. Barry) are very analogous to Mid 20th Century Carribean medical school "doctors."  They can say, write, and use a lot of terminology making them useful for billing purposes, i.e. writing up invoices to Insurance/Government agencies.  These "engineers" like those "doctors" don't and probably never will understand the essence of their professions, though because of their training or lack thereof they really think they do.  When in fact, they are utterly clueless "professionals. 
 Granted, instructional design is not easy! But this book (and the Dick & Carey model in general) go so far into minute details that the bigger picture is lost!   I liked the outlay of the chapters. Each chapter represents a step in the instructional design process. This is the best feature of the book. But then the model/book goes into minutia and makes for heavy & confusing reading. In fact, several times I found myself saying "I think I understood what they meant the first time they said it, but after they said it 10 different ways, including 3 charts & diagrams, now I'm not so sure!"  The use of the examples in the book, particularly the charts & diagrams add to the confusion rather than making things more clear! A further example of this, is that often page 113, for example, will reference a chart on page 118. So amist the confusion, you have to turn the page and look back and forth between the text and the chart.   I also don't care for the size of the book. It's irregular and adds to the cumbersome feel of the text.  While it's true that with instructional design, you have to get down to the nitty gritty detail, this textbook seems to wallow in it much, much too long!  
 After some use of my new notebook (Sony Vaio FE590P) I started collecting dust and fingerprints on the display.  I purchased the monitor wipes to clear the display.  I was foolish enough to trust the packaging!  I expected the product to be streak free.  I tried wiping my monitor with the product and it quickly dried and left horrible visible streaks.  I discarded the first "wipe" and tried again with the second one.  It also left streaks.  I tried wiping vertically instead of horizonatally.  It left streaks.  I tried wiping in circles.  It left streaks.  I tried inquiring about my problem by visiting the manufacturer's web page.  My inital thought was that perhaps I had received a bad batch of product.  I filled out a form and never received a response.  My new thought is that I've been cheated.  Ultimately I purchased a 3M microfiber cloth and some cleaning solution.  That did clear up the streaks left by the monitor wipes 
 Well, the book tries to cover JAI, JMF and J3D all in one book. And does not do too good a job on either (JAI and J3D). I have not tried the JMF chapters. Also my major peeve with the book is that the code for J3D is not available online. I think this was just rushed out of the door 
 I read exactly half the book and stopped.  Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.  As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!  The book is silly and laughable.  The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.  Really bad 
 Another left-wing, hippie idiot who dropped out of any sort of real career in 1975 has to sustain himself by writing this anti-technology dystopic rubbish.  I'm sure that he has plenty of ideological fellow travelers in Hollywood with whom he should team up to make another version of "12 Monkeys" or "The Fight Club."  This is just left-wing, nihilist, anti-human rubbish motivated by a hatred of humanity and mans' productive capacity.    Like, the world ended when we ran out of trees to burn as fuel?  I'm sure that trees were cheaper than coal for 15th or 16th century Britain, but they made the transition from one energy source to another without resorting to cannabilism or having their civilization self-destruct like this author would have us believe.  The collapse of civilizations is not tied to the end of cheap energy, but is more likely due to a descent into decadence and sloth.  If there is not enough oil, we can switch to coal, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, and nuclear (fission or fusion-in the future).    All these self-styled futurists are just full of rubbish and make predictions which they then sell to an ignorant public just so they can pay their rent.  Most science fiction is garbage and this just proves my point.  How many science fiction authors in the early 1980's or before predicted the emergence of the internet?  Almost none by my estimate.  Don't waste your money helping this guy pay his rent.  He's a nihilist and misanthrope.    As long as men are free to think, communicate and trade, long-term optimism is the order of the day as the secular trend for civilization is always upwards and onwards 
 I usually love the Philosophy brand bath and shower gels, but this was a major disappointment-didn't smell anything like pound cake or lavender for that matter-in fact the odor is quite strong and nauseating. There are other gels that are great but AVOID this one! Phew!! 
 To begin, I am not a big fan of Cary Grant, EXCEPT in his Hitchcock movies, where he was excellent. And I enjoy him much with Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby. He was very good in The Eagle and the Hawk with Fredric March. He was tolerable in The Philadelphia Story and Talk of the Town. A friend of mine loaned me this DVD; she just bought it. I had wanted to see what Cary would do in this film, and I wanted to see him in the dress. From the start, the movie was SLOW and BORING, all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny. I also don't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other, and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other. Come on! I just can't understand that sort of romance situation. I felt Cary showed that "mean streak" he can show in some of his films, in the romance situation of this story. I rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end. All the while I kept saying, "Let's move along, let's end this thing, when does he put on the dress?..." but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring,corny jokes. And the part we wanted to see, Cary in the dress, was at the VERY end and not very much at that. Overall, this film was a real disappointment and letdown. The only consolation was that I saw it for free; I didn't have to buy it or rent it. Still, I wasted good time that I could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way. I would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie!  To sum it up, a VERY VERY BORING and DUMB movie, not to waste your time on. 
 Best of the 1970's "Supergroups"? This is the best group of songs they could come up with? Music from bands like Boston, Kansas, Styx, ELO, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Santana and BTO are great choices. But, who in their right frame of mind would consider Grand Funk, Rare Earth, Sugarloaf, or the Little River Band as "Supergroups"? Okay, the Little River Band had several hits, but they certainly weren't "Super". Some of these bands are so dang obscure that I could DARE most of America to name ONE other hit from half the bands on this disc, and I'd bet they'd pull a brain muscle and hemmorhage trying to do it. 14 total tracks. 7 songs are worthy classics, but the other 7 totally miss the boat. If I were producing a disc with these songs, I definitely would not have used the label "Supergroups". Perhaps a more apt title for this CD would be "Poor Man's Hit & Miss Tunes From The 70's". Sound production is less than crisp. Makes a nice drink coaster 
 We bought this boat 4 years ago when my oldest (of three) was a baby.  I totally agree with the others who have said that it is tippy and not safe.  We only used it a couple of times because he would just pitch forward or from side to side.  We used it when he was between 5 and 9 months old and able to sit up, and still had this problem. Maybe an older, much more stable child could use it, but it is advertised for use with infants and it's just not worth the trouble of trying to balance your baby in this thing 
 The information that is in this book is good but it is way overpriced.  I could get the same amount of information in anthor book for 30 dollars cheaper 
 This printing is missing 20 pages. I 've ordered 2 copies and both were defective 
 The controversy around Pope Pius XII's silence during the second world war are rampant as ever. This book is just another attack from the left.   Ironicly many of this Pope's staunchest defenders are Jews.   Claiming that from the middle of Hitler's ally Fascist Italy by speaking aloud against the actions of the nazis against the Jews would have saved more lives rather than endanger every Jew hiding in Catholic homes and church property is unfounded. Claiming that the Church was somehow helping with the attrocities borders on the obscene. This book condemns him for silence. This book distorts a great deal.   Overall, I didn't think much of when I read it. Having studied the Holocaust in great depth I find it rather repugnant in its accusations.    
 I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read.  There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school.  Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it 
 I gotta say this movie is an example of a terrible idea, Swain husband beats the crap outta her and she spends her time running from him. What's worse his friend is a lunatic who want swain's character. Swain's Character is a hillbilly who like's an upper class doctor who she really never connects with, I never really got why Swain settled for a lunatic when she was trying to find inner peace thru the whole movie. This movie puts a bad taste in my mouth, it was a waste of my time it wasnt a story it was an excuse to make a bad movie. (Do not buy)  
 Michael Ruse fails to sustain his argument, I'm afraid, in THE EVOLUTION-CREATION STRUGGLE.  The title is misleading because it's not specific enough.  The story of the anti-Enlightenment/anti-Darwin fundamentalist backlash is not new, and Ruse doesn't attempt to add anything to it.  What IS new is the story Ruse tells of how "evolutionism" was also a reaction to the Enlightenment, a more optimistic reaction.  The best part of the book is Ruse's marshalling of evidence to this effect in the period prior to the Darwinian revolution.  And before I forget to say it, Ruse is not arguing that modern biology and the neo-Darwinian synthesis it's based on is not scientific.  What he is discussing is the wider metaphysical backdrop of the scientific theory of natural selection-plus-genetics.    But it's a classic case of a Procrustean bed -- Ruse tries to fit his intellectual history into the constraining concept that creationists are premillennialists and "evolutionists" are postmillennialists.  In other words, the liberal/progressive intellectuals and scientists can also be situated on the Christian metaphysical terrain -- they believe that it is up to humanity to perfect the world BEFORE Christ returns.  I just don't buy it.  The claim is too big and his evidence too scanty, indirect, and circumstantial.    There does seem to be some truth to a more general idea, which is far from original.  Max Weber, the great German sociologist, claimed that the Protestant work ethic continued to propel the accumulation of wealth even after the religious belief fell away (THE PROTESTANT ETHIC AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM).  And the process philosopher Alfred North Whitehead famously said that "[The Middle Ages] was the age of faith based upon reason.  [The 18th Century in Europe] was the age of reason, based upon faith."  (SCIENCE AND THE MODERN WORLD, p. 57).  In other words, the structure of belief continues to inform thought even after belief fades.  But here is where Ruse goes wrong, in my view.  He elides the distinction, and claims that the BELIEF continues, and so calls "evolutionism" a form of religious belief, a postmillennial religious belief.    Some further thoughts on the flaws in Ruse's argument:  1) Darwin's theory of natural selection has always struck me as depressing.  Compelling, but depressing.  I am certainly not alone in this.  So there is a big problem with Ruse's insistence that "evolutionism" is necessarily an optimistic view.  This is one way that the observable facts do not fit his conceptual scheme.  2) An increasingly influential faction among the evangelical/fundamentalists is known as the Dominionists -- James Dobson of Focus on the Family is the leading figure in this group.  The Dominionists are -- postmillennialists!  They are aspiring theocrats, who believe it the job of the Christians to take over the government and rule according to Old Testament principles in preparation for Christ's return.  This is another case where the observable facts do not support Ruse's theory of "fundamentalist premillennialists" versus "progressive postmillennialists."  3) Ruse has left many support structures out, and expects the premillennial/postmillennial concept alone to support the weight of his vast construct.  There is no discussion of liberal and conservative ideology, for instance, and how they have changed over time in the U.S. and the U.K., a glaring oversight.  Also missing is any examination of the idea of sociocultural evolution, a central concept in anthropology (it should be a central concept in sociology as well), which is not at all the same as biological evolution.  Ruse could make a much more cogent argument if he disentangled the two, but it would be a more complex argument.    I agree with Ruse's practical conclusions, that defenders of science should avoid bashing religion, as Richard Dawkins is prone to do, and that defenders of science should rise above their differences to work together more effectively in keeping ID and other religious notions out of biology classes.  And fortunately the unconvincing historic argument of THE EVOLUTION-CREATION STRUGGLE is not necessary to either of those worthy aims.            
 I'd heard good things about this book.  This was a quick read.  I was irritated by the main character's low expectations in life.  When I was done with this book I was like, "what was the point of that?"  Enough said 
 I wouldn't buy this.  It's just not worth it.  And by the time you realize that, you've already opened the package and can't return it.  I suggest shopping for another product 
 the big brother documentry part was great the janis live stuff is very poor quality sound and picture buyer beware 
 Our family loves soups and that's basically all we eat in the wintertime.  After reading so many postive reviews, I decided to purchase this book hoping to add a few more favorites to our reportoire.  I was very disappointed though.  The soups ranged from bland-tasting to downright unpalatable and we tried several of the recipes.  I recommend "Skinny Soups" by Ruth Glick and Nancy Baggett instead- wonderful flavors and many vegetarian soups and meat soups that taste good even even if you decide to leave the meat out 
 coming from a rock viewpoint, this music is garbage. I see all the other bad reviews and they're getting very low percentage for how helpful they are, and I can't help but think that all those votes are from Air-affiliated entities. As one other reviewer stated, all the songs are repetitive and boring. Some of the songs use the same exact notes throughout the entire song. In my opinion, a lot of today's pop has much more musical talent than this album 
 -Everyone expressing a erudite opinion about Clausewitz or "ON WAR" has completely missed the point here.  -The question is NOT whether Clausewitz or "On War" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. THAT is a moot piont to the Nth Degree.  -The REAL question IS - WHY would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?   -That is the ONLY question regarding THIS particular version of "ON WAR".  -Its the ECONOMICS, stupid ! 
 Perhaps I was distracted when I heard these short stories, but they seemed to lack substance.  The characters seemed like passing shadows - I never knew them well enough to have any solid emotional attachment.  The stories  were all very short, and most felt incomplete.  If you are just starting  with Hemingway, try something else first.  If you like his style, I'm sure  you'll love this collection 
 What a disaapointment!  After devotedly listening to their first album for 37 years, I thought I'd take a chance on this one.  $21.00 down the drain.  This thing really sucks.  They switched from edgey to mellow for this one.  As Woody Allen says in Annie Hall, the next step after mellow is to ripen and rot.  The music, with a few stolen Jerry Garcia riffs, never rocks and rolls.  It does a deliver a lot of stupid new agey messages, however.  Save your money 
 I think that says it all.  Don't waste your time or money 
 I did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation, motor power and style.  I exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange/return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds, even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs!  It is not the electricity as I have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet 
 Harvey Pekar, until recently, has lived a double life.  By day, he worked as a file clerk in a V.A. hospital. By night, he would write comic book stories, most dealing with events from his own life. These scripts were brought to life by other artists to become "American Splendor", the title Mr. Pekar has been writing and publising since 1976. It was adapted into a successful film in 2003.   Mr. Pekar wrote "The Quitter", a chronicle of his early years, as a way to thank artist Dean Haspiel for introducing him to the film's producers. While Haspial is not the ideal pairing for Pekar's writing, his work is a strong, clear accompaniment. Haspiel's cover design clearly evokes the imagery of Will Eisner, one of the medium's masters. This, coupled with Pekar's reputation for consistently strong writing, is enough to raise expectations.  Considering the fact that Mr. Pekar has been writing about himself for thirty years, there's a suprising amount of new material on his Cleveland childhood and adolescence. We see the beginnings of personality disorders that have plagued him all his life - anxiety attacks and compulsive behavior eroding his attempts to function happily in school, at work, or at home with his family. He felt trapped in his workaday life, but recoiled from any interest in which he couldn't immediately excel. Even with these obstacles, Mr. Pekar begins to find his voice as a jazz critic, connect with others in his neighborhood, as well as enter into a relationship.  Since it isn't his wife Joyce Brabner, the reader expects a depiction of the relationship and how it breaks down. Instead, there's an abrupt segue into familiar territory - his friendship with comic legend Robert Crumb, the evolution of "American Splendor", culminating in the film version. There's a brief coda that shows how some of his early demons still inform his life, but we never discover what happened with his first serious girlfriend, or much connecting material that helps pull the two parts of the book together. It's a big disappointment.  Newcomers to Mr. Pekar's work will enjoy his trademark combination of eloquence and candor, but for longtime Pekar fans, I can't recommend it 
 With out a doubt, this has to be one of the darkest movies ever made. Once you get past the woodland creatures things, that were very well done, the movie gives you very graphic scenes of blowing peoples brains out, to torturing individuals that was also very graphically done. If you enjoy the horror of human suffering and pain, then this is the sick movie that you have been waiting for.    Hope you enjoy watching a movie all in subtitles.  
 Beck and Wade have decided that all business interactions can best be explained by grouping people into 2 groups and assigning one major attribute to them. Everyone over 35 didn't grow up with video games, and everyone under, did. Apparently, this makes the 2 groups as different as separate species and all business practices must revolve around some connection to games so that the "gamers" can successfully be integrated into business culture.   I question whether Beck and Wade actually MET any gamers while writing this book. Or tried to paly a video game themselves. While I admire their attempts to encourage the integration of new generational attitudes in the workplace, they still fall prey to stereotypes about games and gamers. pg 117- "Even though...games can privcde a lot of interaction with fellow humans, the depth of that interaction can only be called perfunctory." Their are thousands of Everquest and Second Life users that would completely disagree with that assessment.   Then there are the places where random attributes are attributed to video games. Pg 121 asserts that gamers are more likely to argue that connecting with the right people is the best way to get things done. Supposedly, this attitude comes from games, though the percentages for gamers and non-gamers are both quite high. And they're high because society constantly pushes the idea of connections and networking, not because of some attribute inherent only in video games.  Oh and I also enjoyed the twin assumptions repeated through the book that imply that because gamers are so busy gaming, they have no time for traditional social interactions such as group sports, and that somehow gamers spend more time in solitary activity (games) than the "boomers". First, just because one plays video games doesn't automatically mean one doesn't play sports, or isn't in the band or the science club or any other activity. Second, there are plenty of people of all generations who spent lots of time either watching tv or reading, also solitary activities. I bet lots of boomers spent as much time watching TV as GenX and GenY do in gaming. And we have better hand-eye coordination to show for it.  In general, no matter what statistic it is, the defining attribute is put down to video games. If boomers and GenX/Y responses differ, then it's because of video games. If boomers and GenX/Y responses are similar, the authors attribute it to experience on the part of the boomers and the artificial experience games have given GenX/Yers. It never occurs to the authors that maybe the responses are similar because people across generations feel the same about that issue. Nope, it MUST be the effect of video games.  I do agree with the authors that there are differences in generations that technology has created, but I don't think they are as pronounced as radical as the authors make them out to be. I also think the differences are more in the area of learning and assimilating info, not in inter-office social and teamwork relationships and issues of authority, which is where the authors put their emphasis. I think the concept was an intriguing one, but I completely disagree about the direction and scope of the author's views 
 An inadvertant caricature of masculinity well into farcical territory.   Pittman uses experiential and cinematic evidence to support his flimsy  arguments about manhood.  Long on irritating anecdote, way short on  substance.  Pittman's pawing for recognition he doesn't deserve.  Don't  bother 
 Despite what it says on the Amazon web page AND what it says on the packaging itself, this does not fit my Genesis Stainless Steel Gold C Gas Grill purchased in April 2003 (it's about a half-inch too short).   After finding out it didn't fit, I called Weber to find out what the deal is. After some checking and re-checking the Weber customer service rep said they don't sell the warm-up basket for my model of grill via retail outlets, and the only way to get it is from Weber directly. It cost a few dollars more but they didn't charge for shipping.  Fortunately Amazon's stelar customer service provided a prompt refund and did not charge me for return shipping; 
 This book may be helpful to some wine lovers. But, there's problem in the organization of the book. For example, only 9 pages are allocated to  Bordeaux wine. It's the same number of pages for Lebanon wine. I'm not  a fan of Bordeaux wine. But, most wine lover will need more information of Bordeaux, Italy and Chille wines contained in this book. 
 Upon initial publication, was likely an excellent supplement to the authors' publication "Building the Perfect PC".  Information is now out of date regarding many computer components.  Sorry that I wasted my money on this 
 It is claimed that the Bush administration is loaded with neo-conservatives, supposedly followers of Strauss, who is known as the preeminent natural rights philosopher. So, do natural rights have a thing to do with their policies? First one must find out what a natural right is.  Alas, one turns to Strauss' basic work on the subject. My hat goes off to anyone who can figure out what a natural right is if they have the perseverance to wade through this book. "Obscure" hardly does justice to the convoluted, indecipherable writing of the author. In lieu of clearly outlining a coherent theory of natural rights, the author is most intent on skewering historicists, followers of Max Weber, modern liberals, and others who rely on what men have come to understand about society and thereby fashioned rights.  The idea of a natural right is bizarre anyway. The biological imperative to survive in nature is hardly a right. It's hard to see civilized society being built on the workings of raw nature: the utter harshness would have to be overcome. However, once two or more men come to agreement on behavior and rights, that agreement is relative to them and is not natural, though it may be practical or wise. Of course, the author disdains positive law, or man-made law. The idea that reasonable and self-moderating behavior is pre-social is pure delusion.  But it is interesting to see the dynamics of power with a good mixture of propaganda and ignorance being purified by subtly suggesting that those machinations are connected to philosophies of natural rights. That thinking is at least as obscure as the master's work. 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 Throughout the 1990's, American popular culture was awash with frisson-producing paranoid fantasies ranging from the hit TV show, "The X Files", to accusations that the President's critics were being sytematically murdered by methods and persons unknown.  Observers began to notice what scholar Daniel Pipes called "fusion paranoia"; i.e., the blending of disparate (and sometimes wildly contradictory) elements from Christian apocalyptic rhetoric, UFOlogy, 'moral panic', millennial fears of what the year 2000 might bring, techno-thriller fiction, and what has been dubbed "the paranoid style" in U.S. politics.  Conservative Catholics proved no less prone than fundamentalist Protestants to being swept up in the surrounding culture's manias and follies.  It would be nice to think that the apocalyptic fever has disappeared now that the turn of the millennium is several years behind us having ushered in nothing more remarkable than the failure of widespread predictions that the world's computers would all crash on cue at midnight.  Unfortunately, the continuing incredible success of the (at last count) 12-book "Left Behind" series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins militates against such comforting thoughts.  It was probably inevitable that a Catholic writer would try their hand at this sort of thing, and so we have Michael D. O'Brien's "Father Elijah:  An Apocalypse" along with the rest of the novels in his "Children of the Last Days" series.  Needless to say, as a Roman Catholic, Mr. O'Brien writes with considerably more polish than his benighted Protestant brethren; he also seems able to create characters that have somewhat more depth to them than paper dolls.  Since the author is not shackled by the constraints of biblical literalism, he can also dispense with bizarre and off-putting fixtures from the Book of Revelations, such as giant six-winged brazen locusts whose stings kill, and other equally gory visions.  Despite granting the above points in their favor, his books still hew with amazing precision to the hackneyed formula laid down previously by such Protestant fundamentalist authors as Frank Peretti and Tim LaHaye. In this book, Father Elijah, a Jewish Holocaust survivor turned Catholic priest is dispatched to North America on a perilous secret mission by the Vatican. This is nothing less than to make contact with the Anti-Christ to dissuade him from his evil plan. At the risk of spoiling things, it will be noted here that this infernal personage turns out not to be Nicolae Carpathia, Secretary-General of the U.N., but the President. President of what is made none too clear; Father Elijah's mission takes him to Canada. Considering that this book was published the same year as the Clinton impeachment extravaganza, faithful Christian readers should have no need of having the answer spelled out for them. (All good Christians know that Bill Clinton is the beast with seven heads and ten horns described in Revelations 13.) As with similar-themed books, there has to be at least one token Jewish good guy, presumably to ward off accusations of anti-Semitism.  While Mr. O'Brien has the good taste not to mention what lies in store for those Jews obstinate enough not to convert to Catholicism, other sowers of apocalyptic panic more than make up for this deficiency. (Hint: Jews should pack enough asbestos underwear to last for a long trip.)   Other books in this series take the form of `prequels' and sequels, with settings extending from, roughly, the Paleolithic age (Note to reader: pace, this is meant ironically) to the near future. In the novels set in contemporaneous times such as "Father Elijah", "Eclipse of the Sun" and "Plague Journal", the by-now tiresome tropes of contemporary religious fiction are all wheeled out.   Among these are:  the "soft" totalitarian state that persecutes Christians. (Holy Herbert Marcuse, Batman! Self-pitying Christians in North America who whine about "persecution" should be shipped--perhaps one way--to the Sudan to see what genuine religious persecution is really about.  They might also take in the killing fields of the former Yugoslavia lest they think that religious massacres and expulsions by Christians are something from the remote past.) Noble, upstanding Christian parents, who live in fear of having their children torn from them because they are insufficiently `politically correct'. (Will that hoary cliché never die?  In case anyone has been living under a rock--or perhaps a remote cabin in Ontario; it is now conservatism that has degenerated into a hare-brained hash of contradictory `correct' opinions, all bound together as tightly as the rods of a Roman fasces.) "Feminists", an epithet usually used by conservatives to mean any woman not a doormat, are portrayed in the usual lurid fashion practically as evil succubae; the fons et origo of the Universe's every ill. (Quick!  Can anyone name a single leading present-day feminist now that Betty Friedan is dead and Gloria Steinem long since retired?)  Evil sodomites are presented in time-honored fashion as dissolute and sad--that is, when not fiendishly conspiring with the other standard conservative bugbears to destroy civilization in a fashion similar to "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion".  Top all this off with some Tom Clancy-style high adventure, and voila! There you have it.  Where are Graham Greene, Flannery O'Connor, and Georges Bernanos when you really need them?   It may seem like breaking a butterfly on the wheel to hold up grotesque twaddle like these books for pitiless inspection in the light of common day.  It is not.  During the mid-1980's the publishers of this series of books produced and distributed a truly tenebrous and evil tome, "The AIDS Cover-Up?".  This vile book deliberately aimed to terrorize with spurious projections that AIDS would kill tens of millions of Americans within a decade. To forestall such a cataclysm, it advised that all gays--much less anyone found to be HIV-positive through mandatory testing--be rounded-up and forcibly interned in concentration camps.  According to conservative science writer Michael Fumento (who by his own account lost his job with the Reagan administration for criticizing the book--and the morals of the people touting it), copies of it could be seen on desks all over official Washington in those days.  There are probably still some conservatives who treasure this theo-porn, if only behind the door.  None of the horrors either predicted or recommended by the book ever came to pass, but it was a near thing.  The moral of this story?  Ideas, even the most vicious or worthless, have consequences.  At a time when fantasy and reality are becoming blurred in many minds, books such as Mr. O'Brien's cannot be excused merely because they are classed under "Fiction". People who gabble about the `End Times' in this fashion are (to use a formulation of Orwell's) like those who play with fire who seemingly don't realize that fire is hot and can burn.  If your opponents are not merely mistaken or even just wrong, but are conscious servants of the devil.... Well, there are plenty of deluded souls out there who may decide to suit actions to words.   This series of books (and similar ones by other authors) share a rare distinction: they get it completely upside down. Instead of being threatened by "the dictatorship of relativism", it turns out that what really threatens peace, human rights, and democracy in the world today is what might be called `the dictatorship of certainty'.  In the United States under the presidency of a man gripped by the unshakable delusion that God's will is his will and vice-versa , we now see rank obscenities such as routine and officially-sanctioned torture, cover-ups of massacres, indefinite detention without trial of American citizens and others neither charged nor convicted of any crime, and declarations by the U.S. Attorney General--the nation's highest law-enforcement official--that our "first Catholic President" (as some theoconservative pundits dub him) will only obey such laws as he wishes to.  Not even Presidents Lincoln during the Civil War, Wilson during World War I, or Franklin Roosevelt during World War II did anything like this.  Meanwhile, in Iraq, the Balkans, sub-Saharan Africa and sundry other places; nauseating slaughters go on almost daily, inspired by... feminism?  No; religion, Christianity very definitely included.    Catholicism, more than any other Christian denomination in the U.S. has the poor as its special concern, at least if you believe the hype. In reality it has joined Protestant fundamentalism in collapsing morality down to the private, principally sexual realm.  In this scheme of things, robbing the widow's pension funds for executive perks, and the orphan's Social Security to fund kick-backs to wealthy political donors is, of course, small fault or none.  Instead of showing how they are "not like the rest of men", the popularity of books such as the "Children of the Last Days" series show that some Catholics who preen themselves on bearing witness to a corrupt culture only reflect it as faithfully as a polished mirror--the image is reversed, but every detail is precisely the same. 
 Be aware that this book was labeled as 'trash' by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, and that the Food and Drug Administration issued a paper claiming the author destorts his facts.  The book supports and suggests a chain of clinics called 'HealthMed', which are run by Scientologists.  Make up your own mind 
 This book is incredibly rudimentary. Important information, e.g. the design requirements for the trigger/sear, are sadly lacking.  The most disappointing section for me was the section regarding the barrel.  The section begins "The barrel can be turned from a commercial blank or made from a surplus military barrel." Perhaps I was expecting too much when I thought that the book would cover the making of the barrel too. Even so, there is no discussion on crowning angle, or even advice on reaming the chamber and achieving the correct headspace.  There is better information available on the 'net - take a look at Lilja Precision Rifle Barrels for instance and what Daniel Lilja has written on the subject. How a rifle works can be considered to be pretty simple - and if this book offers anything then it at least offers moral support that building your own rifle is very possible.  If you own a lathe and a milling machine, and have a good idea of what is involved in safe mechanical design, then you can probably design and build a decent rifle from information already available for free.  Looking at the "Search Inside" pages of Bill Holmes' "Master Gunmaker's Guide to Building Bolt-Action Rifles " I think that this would be a much better buy 
 This CD is boring, cliche, all done before garbage. If you really must, buy a used copy or save your money all together. Do not believe the fake reviews posted on the guy 
 I was given this as a gift, so thankfully I didn't waste my money on it.  This sterilizer is so messy and awkward, that I can not recommend it at all.  The metal pan started corroding after only a week.  Little flecks of metal and water soak the bottom of the unit and lifting off the cover will drench your countertop.  All the bottles and nipples and breastpump parts stay wet and spotty, so I can't imagine how it could possibly clean.  Horrible product 
 The title is far better than the actual book.  All it does it make you even more obsessed with food, and now even sugars in fruits are bad!  I don't like the strictly outlined nutritional program--I don't think that works for people who "can't stop eating".  I know that strictly outlined nutritional programs don't work for me.  I know from personal experience that most of the time when people can't stop eating, someone giving you a new list of things you can't eat isn't going to help much.  All this book did was make me feel more helpless in the face of my binge-eating disorder 
 White's press release described them as "A blend of traditional progressive rock with modern elements that will appeal to all age groups. Of course, traditional Yes fans will love the music and are a primary target".  Being a Yes fan, I walked into "White" with an open mind, but I was admittedly looking for the promise of a new prog synergy.  However, I found that the proggiest thing about the album is the (absolutely great) Roger Dean cover.  While "White" displays a musically aware dynamicism, I don't see it to be experimental enough to warrant the "prog" label.  It is probably more accurate to categorize it as contemporary AOR.  Overall, "White" presents itself as being quite safe, and unfortunately in safety there is cliché.  Criticizing an AOR release for being cliché might seem oxymoronic, and I recognize that the style requires a certain well-tread formula.  However, cliché can be manipulated to enhance that material if care is taken.  I'm not sure if that care was taken on "White" to the material's advantage.  The first listen is a little unimpressive, but subsequent listens reveal White's fondness for Rabin-era Yes.  While these songs do not have the same life as Rabin's work, they undoubtedly owe quite a bit to that era of Yes' ouvere.  Like a lot of contemporary AOR, the songs are merely acceptable, and sometimes they are pretty good.  Only rarely do they seem to rise to the occasion.  If White were to release a single, the tune "Give Up Giving Up" is pretty representative.  It's relatively catchy but emotionally static, and has great drums and melodic guitars.  "Dream Away" a potentially great song, but it is marred by a problem that I see permeating "White", and that is the the vocal approach of lead singer Kevin Curie.  The same press release said that lead singer Kevin Curie provides "soulful, touching lyrics delivered with the gravitas of Peter Gabriel and Don Henley".  While he certainly has the ability to produce impressive tone in a wide vocal range, there are times he intends a raspiness in his voice that sounds unnatural.  While it may be convenient to equate this with the expressive qualities of Gabriel and Henley's voice, in my estimation his performance sounds more painful than expressive.  Stranger still, it seems that Curie can control this irritating overtone, as in some tracks it is far more pronounced than others.  I found my eyes tearing up while listening, but out of sympathetic pain rather than emotion.  If he can control it, I wish he would cut it out.  He sounds a lot better without the ball bearings buzzing around in his throat.       To end my criticism, I was also hoping to hear a little more of Geoff Downes' idiosyncratic keyboard voice.  While his distinctive synth sounds are apparent on "White", his role is largely pushed to the background.  Downes' specialty has been in string pads and trumpety leads, and both make an appearance in White.  However, his growing proclivity to use keyboard cliché's is apparent, as well.  When Downes is good, he's great.  When he's not so good, he's cheesy.  Many times on "White", he is cheesy.  However, "White" is not without merit.   For example, I can't help but compare bassist Steve Boyce to Chris Squire.  While he does not have the same overall melodic style, his riffs are undoubtedly inspired by Squire.  The groove that he holds down with Alan White on "Mighty Love" is memorable.    This brings me to the strength of "White".  Alan White's drumwork stands out on this recording, and it is worth checking out. A few years ago on the "Magnification" recording, I said that the older that Alan gets, the harder he hits.  This continues to be true, as his energy is relentless on "White".  Nothing has ever slowed this guy down.  Even when the songs bog down and Curie's voice begins to grate, I can focus on his drumming and be inspired.  After Alan, guitarist Karl Haug also commands a significant presence in White.  Both his acoustic and electric approach is melodic and strong, and uses a wide variety of sounds and techniques, sometimes comparable to the fluid work of Al Morse of Spock's Beard.  His presence seems to inspire Downes' better work on the album as well.  In fact, it would be oh-so-very-cool if Spock's Beard could get Alan White to be thier touring drummer.  Now THAT would be prog synergy.  The Lowdown:  For Yes aficionados, "White" gives the opportunity to listen to Alan with his percussive reigns loosed.  He propels these recordings along.  However, material that is "just OK" is marred by Curie's "unique voice".  If you are a fan of contemporary AOR, you might like this recording, but acquaint yourself with the vocals before you commit 
 I can only thank the good Lord that we have Sanford Levinson to correct the fools who thought that they had a workable document that only got us through a bit under 250 years.  Too bad he wasn't around back then--I'm sure that the Founding Fathers would have sat up and taken notice of his clearly superior genius.  Or maybe not.  Too bad I had to give a book at least one star.  But then maybe Mr. Levinson will correct that glaring deficiency, too 
 I am using this thing with a Toshiba laptop, and a Microsoft mouse and keyboard. It installed as advertised and seemed great - until:  -Generation of random mouse clicks. Seems to do this in all programs and it is very annoying. Imaging editing in Word and having the cursor jump to the mouse cursor location, or just having random right clicks.  -Synchronization and random behavior of the CAP's lock. CAP's lock turns off and on randomly and then will not sychronize with the laptop keyboard. The only remedy I have found is a reboot.  Maybe I got a lemon, but based on other review on other sites, I cannot recommend this device 
 My 8 year old played Xmen for about a half hour on Christmas morning, and hasn't touched it since, even when I ask him to play!! Also, he hasn't even attempted to open the other game for the system - Ben 10, he's just not interested.  The game is far too primitive in it's action and scenery when compared to other options ie. PS2, XBox, Gamecube.  It needs more variety!  The card scanning is time consuming and boring!  By the way, I love Amazon! FAST shipping, great prices 
 The picture book of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all times.  So I was pretty excited to hear Hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like Tom Hanks was a leading participant.   What a disappointment!  The movie's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy.  There are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo (apparently supernatural?)  who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting Christmas messages such as "Do you believe in Ghosts?"  The "lighter" scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling.  Admittedly I saw the movie in DVD format on the small screen and I am told many of the scenes played better in 3D.  Yet "The Polar Express" still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry Christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children.      
 The cover and title sure does fool you.  Best Friends.  Looked like a great book for people like me that enjoy stories about how friends meet and make their journey through life together.  But this book was confusing as far as jumping around.  Porn?  Come on, give me a break.  This book is freakish, yet I read the whole thing... too long and I yet have to know what the entire point of the book was.  These characters were disturbing to me and instead of the title "Best Friends"... try "Selfish Psychos".  Do not waste your time and get this book.  If you are truly interested, see if your local library has it... that way you save your money.  Most terrible book EVER!  OH and my copy of the book had sections to where the letter "x" was replaced by the letter "y".  Nice proofreading 
 For anyone involved in advertising this book provides very interesting read. . Overall not impressed with the content and lack of substance. More marketing than substance! I preferred  High Intensity Marketing by Idris Mootee. This book is LOADED with solid, meaty real world marketing insights and techniques that can are being kept as trade secrets. You will probably find this book a real eye opener. If you're looking for a more balanced marketing book, suggest going for David Aaker's books, some Kotler's books 
 Nothing against Ian Fleming. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't get into this book. The Bond movies are more exciting than the books 
 This author claims that the Baudelaire children cannot see through Count Olaf's disguises, which is patently absurd, as any reader of the Snicket series would know.  She has squandered all her credibility by making this absurd claim, and I would not recommend this book to my dog as a chew toy, let alone to anyone to read.   Either she didn't read the books, didn't really absorb what she read, or most likely, merely skimmed the books and paid little attention to them in her haste to capitalize on Snicket's good name.  Don't read this book, don't get it from a library, it is a big waste of time. 
 As I stated before, I have a fabulous thing called "Digital Cable". One night I was flippin through the channels and this movie was on. I could only watch so much of it before I had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off. Sometimes that happens with "Digital Cable", but it usually it will right itself in the end. As I watched for about a half an hour I could not take it anymore. I tried everything to fix it including switching channels, turning on and off the TV, and things of that nature. I even went as far as calling Comcast and complaining, but even that was a wasted effort. I eventually had to turn it off because I was a hairs-width away from haymakering Morris.   Well, even though Comcast ruined my viewing experience so far, when I was at Blockbuster I decided to give it another chance. I know I mentioned that the lead actor could not act but I thought I could look past this, because it might not be completely his fault. For one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices, or it might be because it's his first movie. Who knows but Howard's mind was made up. "Rumble in the Bronx" was to be rented. From what I saw so far on "Digital Cable", I possibly found a person I could call my mentor, when I enter the world of stuntmen.   When I returned home I threw the DVD in the DVD Player and guess what? The DVD was messed up as well, the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on "Digital Cable". I raced back to Blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy, telling them this DVD was broken. I returned home again and tried to watch it. "WHAT THE HECK!?" I yelled, "IS THE WORLD AGAINST HOWARD TUTTLEMAN!?" You guessed it that DVD was messed up as too. I even tried it out on another DVD Player and it proved to me that the run of DVDs Blockbuster has were all messed up. I got so frustrated that I threw the DVD out the window (I rented it on my father's card so there is no recourse to me).   After I cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica, I was still determined to see this movie. I ran up to Best Buy in Troy, and I found a copy. I asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version, hoping that it was a new pressing. I was happy with his answer and purchased it. Well I returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop. I put the DVD in the DVD Player and dimmed the lights. Finally, Tuttleman will have his moment.   Well to keep this clean and short, let me say that, that night ended with a baseball bat, three (3) stitches in my hand, a broken window, and a hefty grounding-sentence(we are talking WEEKS here). In Conclusion, some movies can't be good, no matter how cool the stuntman, this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot. Later.   
 Was not a pleased with this as I'd hoped..had a very short version of "Big Country" without the wonderful drum solo at the beginning.  I wound up purchasing the original "Big Country" CD instead and have since sold this one to someone else 
 The success of this book might be chalked up to the old axiom how no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people.  I was drawn to this book by it's title and central premise.  TOo bad Ben Sherwood can't write worth a lick.  I'm not sure which is more upsetting:  how poorly Ben Sherwood writes, or how low our expectations have fallen as readers, given the number of positive reviews this book has received.   
 Damn. There's nothing remarkable about the second item on this DVD; it's your standard European-made sexploitation film. "The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield," on the other hand, is reprehensible. It's a hodge-podge of vacation footage of Mansfield, clips from her movie project, and material entirely unrelated to Mansfield, linked only by the voiceover... and then, after an hour or so of light-hearted softcore buffoonery, the movie cuts to her death, spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large, mostly empty mansion she has left behind.  This movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after Mansfield's death. This is exploitation in its worst form. I found the sudden change in tone, the large volume of non-Mansfield material, and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme. Those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy, or softcore porn to tittilate, go elsewhere; this one is not merely bad, but evil 
 I've been running marathons for about 10 years now and never focused my training on diet. I picked up this book in the hopes on finding tips about dieting for runners, but obviously, this book is for walkers, runners. I'm running anywhere between 70 to 100 miles a week and this book is clearly for runners averaging about 15 miles a week. Good book if you're in that camp 
 This book really takes a deeper look at how challenges and adveristies affect you. It definatly makes a connection with the reader and it is very helpfull. The author speaks to you as though you are having a conversation and offers some wonderfull advice. I would highly reccomend this book 
 I think the Muse fled...I read one chapter (the beginning one) and put it down.  I wasn't the least bit interested in what happened to these two losers. (they have to snare my attention....they didn't)    A podiatrist and an attorney....at least the author had the sense put them in two boring professions....  I read Good Grief, Winston's first novel, and loved it!   It had everything, pathos, sadness, rebirth, joy...what happened to this one???? And the descriptions go on and on and on...til I could regurgitate...don't writing courses say...be specific, hit the mark...instead of going around and around and around..until the action stops dead.  Sorry to be so negative...but that's my impression. 
 I bought the soundtrack right when it came out, being a teenaged Beatles fan (who was also a closet Bee Gees fan).  This movie had the star power to be huge, with Frampton and the BGs, but the film must be viewed as a Beatles Revue, not a serious flick.  As for the soundtrack, it yielded three hits -- Aerosmith's "Come Together", Earth Wind & Fire's "Got To Get You Into My Life", and the solo Robin Gibb, whose rendition of "Oh Darling" was a radio hit.  Billy Preston's prostitution, singing "Get Back", was also good.  For these, as well as the rare Maurice Gibb lead vocal on "Mr. Kite", the album deserves two stars.  It's fair to compare it to All This And World War II, since that was crap.  The music is disco- and synthi-fied, and some of the vocals (without the benefit of the filmed context) were scary.  But it was a big hit with the teenybopper crowd, who were into the BGs and Frampton as pop stars/eye candy.  Therefore, without benefit of the video presentation, this soundtrack no longer stands up 
 In desperate need of a light read and curious about the multi-author approach used with this novel, I dove into "Naked Came The Manatee" with anticipation of the fun and excitement typical of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen writing.  The story unravels the mystery behind two heads, both with a great similarity to Fidel Castro that are lost in transport from Florida to Cuba.  Each of the thirteen authors writes a chapter of the novel, with Hiassen and Leonard attempting to pull the story together in the final chapters.  The characters are odd and criminally inept as most characters in Hiassen's and Leonard's writing but the story is underdeveloped and lacks the immediacy of a great crime mystery.  If you have nothing else to read and this book happens to be within reach give it a try. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed 
 In February 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that, "most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities."  This conclusion was endorsed by the national scientific academies of the U.S, U.K., Canada, Russian, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Brazil, China, and India, along with numerous other scientific societies around the world.  Christopher Horner disagrees, as do a few scientists and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.  So if you want to believe that there's no anthropogenic global warming, you're stuck with having to explain why the experts got it wrong, and there are two ways to do this.  The hard way is to get some scientists together, do some experiments, and come up with a theory that explains the data better than the existing theory.  Submit your theory to peer review, and argue your case with more data and theory.  The easy way is to get some lawyers and come up with a conspiracy theory.  Conspiracy theories are fun because they require little effort and they always give you the answer you want.  And they're indestructible!  Evidence against the conspiracy theory is proof of the conspiracy.  Lack of evidence for the conspiracy is proof that it's a good conspiracy.  Oliver Stone made a movie about a conspiracy theory, and it was nominated for 8 Academy Awards.  Christopher Horner's conspiracy theory is about 1000 times more complicated than Oliver Stone's.  It requires scientists from all over the world, including people of all sorts of religious, ethnic, and political persuasions to be embroiled.  It requires oodles of falsified data to be published in the most prestigious journals and willfully misinterpreted by compliant funding agencies.  As usual, the media and the UN are in on it too.  Oh, and Horner suggests that the motive for the conspiracy is communism.  Communism!  The Cubans and the mafia must be feeling left out.  Is there any proof that the world's scientific community is in the grips of a communist conspiracy?  Of course not -- that's how we know the conspiracy is working.  The publishers of the Politically Incorrect Guides are really on to something.  If something bothers you, they will sell you a conspiracy theory to make you feel better about it.  Given that conspiracy theories require almost no research, the profit margin has got to be huge.  Heck they published a guide to the science of Intelligent Design more than a year after the guys who invented Intelligent Design admitted that there was no science behind it.  The plot of this one had the world's biologists, geologists, and paleontologists in an atheist conspiracy.  The weird thing is that there is no end of shady dealings in the real world that one could worry about.  Why make up a bunch of wacky conspiracy theories?  I guess it's fun to pick on egghead scientists, but I think you should consider the possibility that your outrage might be more effectively directed elsewhere 
 Yeah, I know I'll get shot down for the low rating, but I don't really care. The book gets glowing reviews for the most part, because most people find it touching and beautiful, and people like reading something that makes them feel all warm inside. I appreciate the feeling as much as the next person, but, really, I need more to like a book!  Really, I looked forward to buying this book, and perhaps my biggest mistake is having high expectations of it. What a lovely title: The Color of Water. And the story behind it, of McBride's mother telling him that God has no color, God is the color of water, got me all riled up and made me salivate at the prospect of sitting down and reading this book.   Basically, the book is McBride's tribute to his white, Jewish (turned Christian) mother, a woman who manages to pull herself away at a young from her abusive father and start a life of her own. She marries a black man, which is taboo, manages to raise 12 children and put them all through college. I had two problems with the book after I read it: 1. I did not care for the style of the writing because it seemed kind of loose and lacking in tension, not really very 'colorful', not as lyrical as, say, the title's promise. McBride skips around through time looking for stories about his mother, looking for opportunities to praise her. In a way, I began to feel like the tribute was not so much a tribute to his mother as an act of desperate attention from one boy struggling with having been one of 12 children, trying to get Mommy's attention. There's nothing wrong with that, though it just seems a bit obvious to me, and I felt Mr. McBride should've put more 'story' into the story, instead of just using gooey admiration and half-remembered tales as a slippery foundation to stand on. The writing did drag after a while. It's not that I need firm structure in a memoir - the beauty of memoir is, in a way, its subjectivity - but memoir is still a tale to be told, and it's a storyteller's responsibility to use SOME objectivity while writing, to give a richer tapstry. McBride did not.   His mother had 12 children, and this was worth looking into. Yes, that she raised them all by herself is admirable, BUT there's a lot more to the story...his mother's story...her religious choices, for instance: Did she turn her back on being Jewish because her father was abusive? What did she feel connected to in Christianity, what made her feel more comfortable with it? It seems like she felt more accepted within the African-American coomunity, which is fine, but then in that case god is not the color of water, because god is actually within a very specific sphere for a very lonely, very young, poor woman.  Her story interested me and I was extremely frustrated that McBride would not deliver the goods. He speaks about her horrible years with her monster of a father, but also her kind mother (whom, incidentally, she abandons altogether)and leaves so many loose ends. The praise he gives just isnt enough. What about asking her how she felt about having a (second) husband who was only around for the weekends while she was stuck with 12 kids all week? How did he feel about it? No resentment really comes out in the book. No real feeling.    2. The Color of Water did not impressive to me because I did not find the story particularly unusual. SO much hype over something so common here. There are many, many blacks and whites with mixed backgrounds in the US. Not just black and white, but many other colors here (I, for one). This country, as we know, is a melting pot. McBride talks about his family as though it were the only one like this, which leads me to believe that he was extremely sheltered, and remained that way even after growing up. He also presumes a great deal. He presumes that we all know about the racial conflicts at the time, and even if we do, it wouldn't kill him to get into it and talk about it and give specific examples, to elaborate and use the opportunity. But no.  I wasn't crazy about this book...didn't find it nearly as provacative, as diverse, as rich, as lyrical as it could have been. I suppose it would not have been considered good manners by him to delve even more into his mother's more private life, but really! The woman that is Ruth disappears behind McBride's sweet praise, and I sense her story would've been truly interesting had and her son viewed her as not just a mother, but also woman.  And McBride too. His story would've been better if he would've written as a writer as well as a son, not just a lovesick son paying his dues to Mom.  I suppose the book is ok. It's not terrible. I did not fall in love with it, though I know most people have. I'm ok with not loving it though, and can honestly say that this was one of the very few times I've ever picked up a book because of hype, and to be sure, it's the last time 
 Writer spends two years with the team yet offers about as much "inside" information as a guy who sells cars down the street at Rodmans.  Obviously aimed at the masses, but a book like this has  a much narrower audience and the authour fails miserably.  Lazy writing, factual errors, you name it.  Where's Michael Lewis - Moneyball when you need him?  THERE was a book that was so in depth, so appealingly detailed it ATTRACTED the masses.  Holley was a lazy hack with the Globe, he's a lazy hack here, and he's now a lazy hack on the radio.  Somebody petition his editors for his notes so maybe we can learn some information we don't know besides Charlie Weis saying Patrick Pass can't play.  Save the money, send me an email and I'll give you the book for free 
 It looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. Like a brand named leather wallet. But there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. Hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos.  There is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). There is no way to clip to the belt. Will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. Bought another handy synthetic case afterwards 
 I don't know what everyone loves about this book?! Yeah, I thought the title was funny, but boy was I wrong about its contents! As an expectant father who has read quite a few books meant specifically for fathers, I was expecting a bit more from this one. What I came to find out was that unfortunately, the title of this book is its only redeeming feature.  This book is neither informational nor funny. Its brevity in actually providing useful information was appalling. Do they think we are Neanderthals who aren't interested in having a positive and interactive child birth experience with our wives? Beyond this, the book is completely chauvinistic towards women in every way possible. It does not teach men to enjoy and learn with their partners during the pregnancy, it tells them how to "deal" with their hormonal wives and ways to avoid getting themselves involved.  After reading this book, I was actually offended to think that anyone would consider men in this light. As a man who is interested in his wife and in learning about his yet unborn child, this all too common outlook about men and pregnancy is exactly what we do not need on our bookshelves.  Forget this book altogether and check out one that will actually be funny, informative, and teach you a thing or two! My favorite book is one in the series by Armin Brott. He is a great writer with lots of great resources and insight into what it is to be an expecting father. Try starting with The Expectant Father: Facts, Tips and Advice for Dads-To-Be. You will not be disappointed 
 This is not a review of Ms. Yates's writing.  Instead, I am awarding the single star to the physical book perpetrated by the University of Chicago Press in 1991.  The good news is that this edition doesn't cost very much.  The bad news is that the 1991 edition is a bad reproduction of an earlier edition.  The ink bleeds all over some of the pages.  There are diagonal streaks on many pages.  Sometimes the ink is light grey on one side of a diagonal streak, while it is dark and smudged on the other side.  Parts of letters that landed in the streak are missing.  A note on the back of the title page claims only that "The paper used in this publication meets the minimum requirements of the ... Standard ... for Library Materials."  Does this less than ringing endorsement mean that the paper is acidic and will soon deteriorate?  If so, it won't be much of a loss 
 I didn't make it up- it's on the book jacket. Only a complete dunce would be blind to this tome's innumerable inconsistencies. Tripe. Pure and Simple. You are warned. 
 everyone, it seems, agrees that Daydream Nation is the pinnacle of what Sonic Youth can do--that was more than 15 years ago.  Murray Street, NYC Ghosts and Flowers, Experimental Jet Set--these are the nadirs:  absolutely worthless exercises is pastiche/collage guitarscapes/ "Poetry"...there are 2 good songs that remind one of the early Youth (if you don't know EVOL or Sister--get them!):  "peace attack" and "new Hampshire"  the rest of this, after 3 listens, is, i think, cack!!!  avoid.  a waste of money.  i was ripped off!  come to think of it, i am pretty peeved!  happy i bought some good records this week:  BLACK WATCH, "the innercity garden EP," and BLOC PARTY (well, it's ok).. 
 Um can I yawn first before I type this ? Hmm guess not , well let me see where do I start , oh yes I remember reading about this in the papers before the film came out and said to myself  " Oh my God , WHAT !? How can this be , how can they do this , what are these people thinking !? "  Whats next " beyond the towering inferno " ? Or better yet  " Titanic 2 : it was all a dream " ?  If you value your money people , do NOT buy this , hell you shouldnt even rent it , better to wait to see if it comes on late night tv .  This movie is stupid and silly and just dumb  I mean lets see we have Kojak on the ship with his goons all holding machine guns shooting people and going after Veronica Hammel , I mean HELLO the ship is UPSIDE down and sinking , now do you readers see where Im going ?  Now Im going to continue my yawning excuse me .............. (snoring)  Um Im up again one more thing Irwin Allen must be turning in his grave asking himself  " Why why why shelia ( Irwin Allens Wife ) didnt you slap me silly when I came up with the idea ! ? "  ok ciao............ 
 There was just too many questions hanging unanswered at the end.  The author spends too much time describing -in such ANNOYING detail- things that aren't important, but leaves all the important detail out. I don't even know what most of the characters look like because the descriptions were pretty much non-existent.  I skipped a lot being there were a CHAPTERS that would only talk about how the character felt. Very disappointed, and not so optomistic about book 3. Hopefully all the questions from this book will be answered then.  
 When I brought it back to Walmart, the customer service person exclaimed "Not another one of these!"  Yes it's a lemon.  It worked some times, but never very well.    Good idea - bad product.  I'm going to try the Linksys version.  
 I enjoyed the first hundred pages of this book, as Daisy, a 20 year old English girl, tries to find her way in the world.  But after she marries and moves to Ireland, the book starts to drag.  The characters she meets there are never fully fleshed out, so their eccentricities seem incomprehensible. I skimmed the second half. I recommend The Dower House, also by Annabel David Goff, instead of this book 
 This book is only for those who manage a BI project development. If you are not involved in this sector, don't buy it 
 I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, "Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good..."  Wrong-er words were never spoken.  This is the first Patterson novel I have read.  I am glad that I borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself.  I suggest that if you insist on reading this, than you would be wise to do the same.  Let me just say that I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read.  I feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment I experienced.  Maybe because it was "co-written" by this Gross person, but it just seems that this book was written too quickly, with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought.    I kept reading, hoping that the story would get better, but it siimply did not.  When one of the characters was in mortal danger, I found myself thinking "who cares?"  This boring read has an utterly predicitable love-story woven throughout, and again, it seems pointless and cheesy.  One reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel.    The plot twists are predictable and uninteresting, and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat.  The sentence structure is so elementary that I was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade English student.  I am by no means a "book snob" but I cannot believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating.  It is just beyond me.  If you are looking at the writing alone, it is terrible, not to mention the unbelievable events that take place.  Main character Boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just cannot believe any of the events could possibly take place.  I know that a lot of die-hard Patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because I didn't like this book, but I am trying to be as honest as possible.    Maybe some of his earlier works are better?  Well, I guess they couldn't be a whole lot worse in any case 
 If there has ever been a demonstration for the necessity of a good editor, this is it. "Legends" seems to be a loose aggregate of a huge pile of note cards without much shape or accuracy. Every page or two I find a mistake. These mistakes are often minor (like mis-copying the name of Baron v. Egloffstein from Walace Stegner's superior "The Hundreth Meridian"), but it certainly undermines everything else the author says.  Aside from that the author is rather hypocritcal - he sneers at the racist Anglos in the Southwest, but has no problem refering to Chinese owners of dry cleaners as a mafia. He complains about the waste of water in the arid Southwest, but he makes sure to play a round of golf whenever he finds a green. I find the book rather irritating, and the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that the disjointed nature of the narrative makes it of no consequence if you read the book in daily five minute increments. If you want to read about the history of the Southwest, try Wallace Stegner's books, Anne Zwinger's "Deserts of the Southwest" or "Cadillac Desert", but don't waste your time or money on this 
 There must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason, like it enough that this movie has been classified as a "cult classic" of sorts. Obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, they have a cross selection of everything from the works of Bergman, Antonioni, Fellini, Godard to the bottom pit of hell with Michael Bay's The Rock and oh dear god, Armageddon! The Man Who Fell to Earth is therefore prime Criterion fare, but is the film itself any good?  Nicolas Roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director. Has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed? This David Bowie vehicle is no different with it's oh so 70's mileau. I especially love how time changes throughout the film, you see characters getting older except Bowie who is an alien. Decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970's! Awesome, really!  It goes without saying that this film is another of Roeg's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise, capitalism, consumerist spending, etc. That these ideas are packaged so blatantly, ( the movie about alienation with an alien! ), and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema. If you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world, there is no better director than Michaelangelo Antonioni with L'avventura, La Notte and L'eclisse for starters. Nicolas Roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent.  The best part of this film is it's sense of humor, it can be funny in a tacky, empty sort of way. Plus we get lots of nudity and sex, so that's fun, supposedly. Directors by the 1970's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible, because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition! Right? Ugh...   The DVD is high-quality Criterion Collection work, but the quality of the movie is your call. I find it to be utter junk but worth a look, you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life. Nicolas Roeg is a fraud, we have to face up to it 
 This is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. I picked it up on the strength of Deep South, which I thought was really terrific. It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback.  Flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeon's own family. The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. Some may like the flavor that this element provides, but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South, and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. Flashback, on the other hand, felt painfully contrived. The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary.   If you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel, then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. Judging from the reviews, not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines.  I will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book, because I did like Deep South so much. It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing, but hope that it can be redeemed with a third. 
 Christopher Makos is proof that you don't need talent to bang out a career in photography. Besides being reviled in much of the fashion world and completely dismissed by the art world, Makos's photos are tired, old-fashioned pin-ups of handsome men. Don't confuse the beauty of the subjects for any sort of vision from the "artist." Calvin Klein's contribution does not save this mediocre effort. save your money 
 If you're looking for an accurate hygrometer, this isn't it! it was 15 points off when I tested it for accuracy! Amazon is taking back as defective so, i'm glad I bought it at Amazon 
 Wow! This is without a doubt,  THE WORST ORIGINAL CAST RECORDING I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE!!! Every song is pathetic, thank God there are only 14 of them because if there were any more i would have destroyed this crap! Not even "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" was this bad (And that was really bad). While I was listening I kept waiting for it to get better, to have some whitty lyrics or a good melody or somthing, ANYTHING, but nothing changed it just kept getting worse.  This crap includes the songs: This Side of The Tracks --1/10 One Step Closer --4/10 The Buck Stops Here --5/10 It Doesn't Take a Genius --5/10 Owner of my Heart --5/10 The Great American Tv Show --2/10 Flushed Down The Pipes --5/10 Storm's A-Brewin'--5/10 Road Kill --5/10 But He's Mine/It's Never Easy --3/10 That's Why I Love My Man --4/10 Panic --5/10 Finale --1/10 This Side of the Tracks (Reprise) --1/10  When I bought this album I thought it was going to be another Bat Boy, but boy was I wrong! Don't buy this disaster of an album you will be sorry if you do!   P.S The little lines before the numbers are minuses 
 Okay, it's not that bad, but I've been trying to upgrade the review titles lately and couldn't resist.  Anyway, LOLA MONTES might carry the high cachet of a master's masterpiece, but I could barely keep my eyes on this story of the grand courtesan of Europe, Lola Montes, who left Liszt, loved King Ludwig, and wound up in the middle of a circus with Peter Ustinov wearing the tall silk and cracking a whip, the audience shouting out indelicate questions, and her life being replayed in a series of flashbacks.  The lovely Lola, played by the monotonous Martine Carol, may have led a fascinating and compelling life, but it failed to generate a spark with me.      The thing does look good though, as far as I could tell.  Nice framing, editing, layers of action, that kind of stuff.  When this Fox/Lorber dvd wasn't showing off its scratches and flares it was fluttering across the screen.  Even with a pristine print and a perfect transfer, though, I don't think I'd care to sit through this one again.  
 RC Sproul Jr. makes a compelling argument as to why Christian parents should homeschool their children.  His primary text is Deuteronomy 6 where God commands His people to teach His Law to their children.  Certainly the best place to teach, train, and raise godly children is in the home.  Parents aren't competing with  "the world" and children aren't confused by the two drastically different approaches to the way they see things and the way they are called to live.  I totally buy that.  What I do not appreciate is how simplistic Mr. Sproul Jr. can be when it comes to the "how" of homeschooling.  I understand that this is not the main focus of his book.  Certainly he is more interested in telling us why it is important.  However, I cannot sit back and accept ideas like the only textbook you really need is a Bible.  He says things along these lines over and over and over again, making his point that we need to be teaching our children the Faith and that this must be their primary curricula from which all others stem.  And yet, he downplays all other subjects as though they were an aside.  We are commanded by God to value the life of the mind and to love Him with all of our minds.  One way, perhaps even the primary way we do this is by learning and not only about the Lord.  The "how" is more than a conversation.  Yes, school is all of life.  He makes this big case for that and then stuffs in a line or two here and there that his kids do learn math and receive "formal" schooling.  I guess my biggest problem is the writing style.  Sproul rambles, like he's having a conversation with himself.  I think this leads to a lack of clarity and makes his book difficult to follow.  While his main point is the "why" of homeschooling, he often tacks on several points on the "how" that made me quite frustrated in attempting to follow his argument.  All in all, I don't really recommend this book.  I would recommend instead _Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning_ by Doug Wilson instead 
 I wouldn't even give this toy a 1 start rating......we bought it for our kids for Easter and it hasn't blown one bubble for us....first the tubes were pinched off so we fixed it, no bubbles.....so we cleaned it per the instruction manual,STILL no bubbles!!! I have however poured bubbles over the feeder area and got lots of bubbles that way......but to use it the way its meant we haven't had any luck!!! What a disappointment!! 
 its really too bad the warning about thorsson being a satanist was removed from here. this is information that concerns the material of the book and the tone of the whole thing. i have it confirmed by the group of asatru that asked him to leave, that this is true, and he is also a priest of set. this colors all the books knowlege and is just a relavent to readers as any other information in these reviews 
 I just can't believe people buy his! It's like my little brother and his friends screaming in front of the PC microphone with the original songs as background music. They're just killing the artists. Green Day, U2, Avril Lavigne, Franz Ferdinand, Kelly Clarkson....there's no way I would ever enev consider about buying this thing.  Are you people really gonna tell me that these kids can sing? I bet they're just a bunch of kids whose parents aren't working and they need money for food!!  Please don't even try the music sampler, or your ears could suffer pretty serious damage, I mean it, that's what's happening to me now!! 
 If you are addicted to reading the tabloids then you'll love this book. If you're looking for depth, and intellectual stimulation stay away 
 If you are into religion, this may be a good book for you.  If you are not, it is not 
 For some reason, Amazon deleted my earlier review, although it was not obscene or offensive. So I'll restate it in really simple terms: David Brock contends that critics of the mainstream media are all narrow-minded conservatives who simply don't want to read about social trends they don't like. This is nonsense. You don't have to agree with the Christian right - I certainly don't - in order to perceive liberal bias in the media. I would give some examples, but I'd probably get censored again 
 I followed the instructions carefully, washed only in cold water, tumble dry extra low, etc. but these sheets still shrank. Also terrible pilling after only a few months. I do not recommend. The sheets were wrinkly, but I could live with that, but not the pilling, which makes them uncomfortable to sleep on 
 As someone very interested in urban exploration (especially in the subways) I wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it. After reading many of these Amazon reviews though, I opted out of a purchase, and took it out of my Bronx library instead. Thank goodness as I only wasted valuable time, and not any money.  This book is a sham. It is obviously mostly fiction. And it's boring fiction at that. The book is divided into chapters, each chapter a new "adventure."   I read the subway one first, where the "explorers" take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line, to see the City Hall Station, which opened in 1904 (NYC's first station) and closed in 1948. The station is located on the loop of the 6 train, that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the last stop, Brooklyn Bridge. First of all, anyone can go on this "adventure." Just stay on the train at the last stop, Brooklyn Bridge, and that's it. Despite the author's attempt to make this sound risky, no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on (like they really care), just sit down. The author created some "European tourists" that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the last stop, and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying "are we on the wrong train?" Well, unless all those huge "6" signs that are lit all over the train are difficult to read, then you probably got on the correct train. The author also fails to mention that the MTA used to give public tours all the time through this station (and others like the 18th street on the 6 and more) but stopped after 9-11. This chapter was a joke.  I started reading the other chapters, and saw they were no better. I then started to breeze through the book. One thing that is very obvious - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all. This, despite the fact that on page 67 the author states, "Josh takes out his camera and snaps away at every pipe and puddle..."  But no photos of their "adventures" are in the book. Why? Because it's fiction.   There are photos of what they are supposed to be exploring, sure, that's easy. There's even one pic of one of these clowns hopping some fence somewhere, ooo. Buit no pics of the actual "adventures." I guess "Josh" lost all those pictures when he went to CVS to have them developed.  The funny thing is, you can save yourself a lot of time by just going online and viewing pictures of these things for yourself. Especially the City Hall station, there are tons of pictures of it available from the people that were in there during the tours.  Just stay away from this sham of a book, it's really a huge waste of time 
 It seems as though the smooth jazz artist are trying to attract the r & b listener.  The cd was done in poor taste and the songs lack creativity as well originality.  Too many vocals.  I would rather here him play his wonderful guitar.  I love Norman Brown but it seems as though he just through this together 
 ...particularly one who falsely refers to himself as a prince and who produces trash like this. When Doves Cry is an unashamed rip off of MC Hammer's excellent Pray and the title track is far too long for my liking. Save your money.  
 As an experienced trader who has bought thousands of dollars of trading books from Amazon I found this one less than impressive.  This is not about Chaos.  This is not about trading Chaos.  One of the other reviewers says "It's interesting to note that in this new book, the chaos-derived indicators (alligator, AO, and fractals) are not changed."  Given that these sexily renamed indicators are just moving averages and macds with tweaked parameters then its not really surprising.  For a real book by a real trader try "Trading Day by Day" by Chick Goslin.  For ideas about how to trade try "The Ultimate Trading Guide" by John Hill of Futures Truth.  For psychology try one of Mark Douglas's books or Brett Steinbargers book.  Good luck in a tough industry :) 
 Story of the World is "History lite" -- less filling.  Without maps, timelines, pictures, and with text high on choppy sentences and "!" it is tough to get much out of it.  
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 OK, I've looked through all the other reviews on here, and I know that anyone who does the same will probably go with the looming majority vote and get this album but PLEASE DON'T!!! About a year ago I first heard Different Class and thought it was great. So much fun, excellent lyrics, and just really great! the melodies, the instrumentation...amazing. So recently I heard This Is Hardcore. A few of the songs are pretty good (Dishes, The Fear, The Day After The Revolution) but for the most part it's just plain BORING!!! Where did the fun go? This album is sad, dreary, and dull. Yes, it is a darker mood, and I realize that Jarvis Cocker probably had a reason to write such melancholy songs, but after hearing Different Class, who wants to listen to them? Many of the songs sound the same and, while not being terrible, were completely uninspiring. Buy Different Class instead. It rocks 
 Let me say at the start, I'm a big fan of Jayne Ann Krentz. I read all her books, under all her pseudonyms, and love 99.9% of her work.  From Krentz, I usually expect quirky heroines and endearing heros. Though they may spar at first, it's usually a fair give and take between the two, and a genuine affection quickly builds. It would seem the characters bring out the best in each other, and we love it when they're together. I usually smile a lot when I read a Krentz book, and I miss the characters when I finish.  Sweet Fortune must have been written by Krentz's evil twin. There is nothing endearing about "Hatch", our business-driven hero with no sense of humor and no warmth. And there are no witty verbal exchanges between the two. Our heroine, "Jessie", endures put-down after put-down without ever coming out on top, and seems to apologize on nearly every page. Hatch's character is always right, and unpleasantly smug. When Jessie inquires about his previous marriage, Hatch "puts up" with her questioning in a terribly condescending manner, because, we're led to believe, she is out-of-line in asking. And -- oh no! -- she apologizes for bringing it up. These are two people sleeping together, contemplating engagement, and he's behaving as if it's rude for her to ask if he had been married before. This is not a dark, brooding Duke from the Regency period that you might love to hate in the first few chapters. No, this is just a 20th/21st century know-it-all jerk that anyone with a shred of self-respect and an ounce of self-esteem would avoid.  I love a good dominant male in a romance novel... but the relationship in Sweet Fortune made me cringe. It was actually physically unpleasant to read this book.  Pick another Krentz book, that's my suggestion 
 Be careful - this is only the student's solutions manual and NOT the textbook.  
 Elmore Leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  He has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  What many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, Leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  As such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  However, 'Be Cool' is not one of his best.  The concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  And not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  Chili Palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  As always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  However, when reading 'Be Cool' I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  Many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  Also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  Leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  The reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  I'd always recommend Elmore Leonard as a quick, enjoyable, "beach" read.  However, go with something else of his instead of 'Be Cool. 
 As an attending/assistant professor of anesthesiology I frequently recommend books for residents to read. I still recommend this book, but with the caveat that much of the information is outdated and some of it is no longer even held to be fact. The underlying theme of the book - that comorbid states influence anesthesia and vice versa - is still true. I tell residents to get a used copy or wait until a new edition comes out 
 I bought two Bionicles for my son's stocking at Christmas.  He is 5 so I had to help him put them together.  It took forever to construct this sad little robot and within minutes of playing with it, it began to fall apart.  The instructions are not clear and the overall durability just stinks.  If your child just wants to construct them and display them, then this is great.  If your child wants to play with them, forget it.  Go buy a preassembled action figure and move on with your life 
 I agree with what Elain, another reviewer, writes below. Told through a series of letters, the novel spans Bess' life. I found this tedious and the writing unnatural, written for the readers of the novel and not for the readers of the actual letters. Bess meanders through her life, a goody-two-shoes, writing smarmy virtuous thoughts while manipulating those around her- the only element of the story that was interesting. elain wrote:   Despite rave reviews, I thought Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey's A Woman of Independent Means was a weak story. For one thing, the life of the protagonist Bess was only explored through her correspondence over the years. It is impossible to reveal a whole life through letters only. There are other nuances to a character that cannot possibly be revealed through letters; those are only what Bess chooses to write about. It's true that a life through letters gives the novel character, but also it does not expose as much as an omnicient narrator would. Also, it seems that Hailey adds dimension to her novel by introducing a string of tragedies. It is very uncommon that Bess's husband and son die within her lifetime, her house burns down, her daughter is struck by a car and later befriends a count, etc. Such events were constantly inserted into the story until it became unrealistic and maudlin. It may be true that Bess lives a life scarred by tragic events, but these happenings are so plentiful it is almost fantastical. To sum it all up, if you're interested in exploring the life of a very colorful lady, read this. But if you're looking for a novel that will leave you awed, you'd better head back to the bookshelf 
 Not his best book,I Thought Waldo Lost in New York is more authoritive. I mean who honestly belives that someone who is always lost can be trusted to help other people become self reliant, when he can't even rely on himself 
 The illustrations are spectacular in Special Cases, and many of the anecdotes are vividly written.  But the author also omits much of the subject matter's historical and scientific context, leaving the  "special cases" looking more like simple freaks.  As well, this  book is poorly organized and poorly edited, so that by the end I was  completely frustrated with Ms. Purcell 
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 Since this seems to be the subtext of the book Are Men Necessary, I think it should have been the title.  I read her excerpt from Are Men Necessary: "What's a Modern Girl To Do." I am giving it two stars because as a graphic designer, I like the 50s-style book cover illustration of the woman in the red dress reading a book in a subway train while the male passengers are watching her.   I am a single woman just like Maureen Dowd. But I think I know why she is having trouble dating.  She only goes out with rich, powerful men; usually celebrities, Republicrat or Demopublican politicians, and Beltway journalists sycophantic to them. These men probably really don't want a smart, talented woman. Why would they, when they're used to dating women who are just as shallow as themselves, and, if they're Beltway journalists, don't seem to dare criticize the Bush Administration like she does? For this very reason, her making fun of the Bushies and John Kerry in her columns probably alienates these men from her even further. I wouldn't be surprised if these very same men loathed Stephen Colbert and anonymously left death threats on his voicemail after he ranked on George Bush at the correspondents' dinner last April. Although her columns do sound bitchy and childish and no less superficial than her dates do; since these articles dwell on the politicians' personalities more than their policies.  I live in San Francisco, and do computer art and consulting for a living. I'm sure this requires more brain-power than writing a fluffy book complaining that men don't like smart women. I've been to Burning Man. I'm in the Green Party. Why am I mentioning these all-too-personal-and-irrelevant things? Because if these men don't want to date Maureen Dowd because she's too talented as she claims, they would probably not want to even think about dating a semi-hippie computer geek like myself. If she's really too smart for them, they'd consider me too much of a freak.  But I accept this. I guess it's much easier for me to not lose sleep over the fact that elite men are probably not going to like someone like me than it seems to be for Maureen Dowd. Because these men are not part of my world, but hers.  I'm not surprised she assumes that all men hate smart, talented women. It's because these are the only types of men she associates with. Fortunately, there are lots of decent, thoughtful, hard-working men out there who are not nearly this petty. But if she really wants to find them, she'll have to get out of her Hollywood-Beltway ghetto/ivory tower and into the real world.  To summarize, "What's a Modern Girl To Do" is nothing more than a sour-gripes-fest complaining that she can't get a rich, powerful man. Well, I can't either.  Maureen needs to hang out with a different crowd, like I do 
 At the beginning of this Sherlock Holmes pastiche by Caleb Carr, our friend John Watson, M.D., arrives at Baker Street to discover Sherlock Holmes perusing a mysterious coded telegram.  Once deciphered, the telegram proves to be from brother Mycroft, who--wonder of wonders, to any Sherlock enthusiast--has cabled from scotland to inform the Master his skills are needed in the matter of murder most foul.  To the train, Watson!  And don't forget your trusty service revolver!  Having quite enjoyed Carr's historical crime fiction, I was looking forward to seeing how he treated the world's first consulting detective. At first, my expectations for success seemed to be realised.  Watson's voice in narration, the initial depiction of Holmes, the outre nature of the crime, all are reminiscent of Conan Doyle at his finest.  However, as I continued reading, I began to be less and less satisfied.  Something was...not quite right, and it kept getting less and less right as the book progressed.  First off, it seemed to me that Carr had only the most superficial understanding of the characters, and this was not enough to carry them beyond the confines of Baker Street.  Once Holmes left his familiar props, he became quite flat. I always imagined the master with a twinkle in his keen, grey eye, but this Holmes didn't have one.  I did not see his excitement over the case or his delight in his own powers.  Carr also seems to have forgotten the numerous times Holmes was able to put distraught females at ease when Watson could not, which made later portions of the books sit quite ill with me.  For his part, Watson was too...active.  We, the readers, know that Watson was an integral part of this duo, as does Holmes himself.  But John H. Watson, late of the Northumberland Fusiliers, was the most self-effacing of gentlemen, always playing down his role in order to cast a brighter light on the doings of his partner.  In the Italian Secretary, however, Watson takes an active role to the point that this tale seems to be one of his adventures, with Holmes merely a presence in the background.  We hear quite a bit about Watson sleeping, eating and dressing, but we don't see the Master at work.  And that disappointed me.  The other characters were two-dimensional in the extreme.  Mycroft had nothing to do and seemed to have been included because, well, it's a Holmes pastiche and so must include every single indication that we've read our Doyle (although the Persian Slipper was missing and Carr never did tell us WHICH pipe Holmes was smoking).  In the end, though, it was the crime that failed to excite.  Whereas it seemed in the beginning not to be without features of interest, the explanation turned out to be the most mundane imaginable--barely worth the Master's time.  In fact, the rationale for calling Sherlock in rather than the local constabulary stretched my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.  Given that the crime was dull, Carr tried to liven things up with an action sequence at the end that was more Hollywood than Holmes.  The last three or four chapters were so tedious I could hardly get through them. I was reading this at the doctor's office and I nearly forsook TIS for People Magazine;  it was that dull.  Although I had hopes, Carr's take on Holmes was ultimately disappointing.  I still have found no one who is able to recreate Doyle's vision like Nicholas Meyer.  Save your money 
 This was the first book by this author that I had started to read. Perhaps, that was my first mistake. I truly did not like this book -- the characters, the plot, the overall language in the book -- all disgusted me. I could not bring myself to finish the book. If the rest of this author's books, are anything like this one, I think I will be avoiding this author's work 
 These are great films and the set is lovely. But boo to Criterion anyhow for not sticking up for Cassavetes scholar Ray Carney, whose name was removed from the set after months of work because of his feud with Cassavetes' widow Gena Rowlands. Buy the DVD set, anyhow, you must, but go to the Cassavetes pages, find Carney's links, and read his account of the troubles he's had, trying to preserve and expose people to rare cuts of FACES and SHADOWS he himself tracked down... Sorry to take sides -- Gena Rowlands probably has her own justifications for feeling as she does -- but I greatly admire Carney's contributions to keeping Cassavetes' memory alive and exposing people to his films; he put an amazing amount of work into CASSAVETES ON CASSAVETES, too. It sucks that he kind of got stiffed here.  
 Nowadays, you can get a similar product at any Target, Walmart, etc. for a lot less. Plus, the closeness of the shave is not that great, but can be helpful if you need a quick touchup b/c it fits in your purse or desk at work. So, it's a great emergency tool if all other options are not available 
 I tried to read this book(translated) to the portuguese, about 15 years ago.Even never finishing it, I as a brazilian (unemployed) agronomist must tell the reality about weberianism. At first, Max Weber was a man looking to show the reality.He wasn't a bigot(or mad) such as Loraine Boettner, Eric Jon Phelps, etc. With no doubt, Max Weber was a great scholar, a man with great IQ, a man man looking for reality.Even with this qualities, Max weber was wrong.Even a man like Max Weber, like you and me, is ever a prisioner of his times, informations and reality. The core idea of this book is that capitalism, industrial revolution and modern science were made by protestantism. Very believed idea in Weber's times. In fact, Weber puts "the cart ahead of the horse", in this idea.In fact, modern world wasn't created after Luther.It was shaped in XV Century, with the press and Great Navigations. The press was invented by a catholic german, called Johann Gutemberg.All the great navigators were catholic men.Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Bartolomeu Dias,Cabral, Gil Eanes,etc. 100% of then were catholics and were under catholic kings money and orders.With the Great discoveries the American continent was under Europe's hands.The claim that protestantism was the source of Europe's power was and is a fraud. In fact economically and lively, after Luther, protestant Germany became a nightmare until the end of 30 years War, in 1648.The claim that protestantism was good for Europe is a possibility, not a fact. In fact, we could see protestantism is a result of nacionalism, church's abuses, education and greed for church's money. Not all protestants countries of Europe had good economical results.Germany was doomed after Luther's Reformations.Not all catholic countries had bad economic results, as France shows.Spain and Portugal were bad, after jew's expeling, not after any reformation. With the Industrial Revolution, coal became condition "sine qua non" for economical sucess.And the Geology(not theology)decided the future for nations in Europe.With no coal Portugal, Spain, Italy were senteced to relatively poverty, in Europe.France with bad coal reserves, has some dificults in industrialization.Belgium, even more than 90% of his population in catholic church, had no economical problems, because Belgium had great coal's mines. Why England had so good economic results, ahead of every other european country?Beeing an island, England shouldn't have an expensive army against invasions.Then, England could built the biggest navy in the world.Geography, not theology gave economic sucess to England in XVI and XVII Century.With the Industrial Revolution, England had coal reserves looking to be minerated. Geography and later geology gave England industrial and economical sucess.With the 30 years War, Germany was splited in about 300 feufdoms. The England's decadency also came from no theological problemas, but geological, political and tecnological problems.With the reunification of Germany, an industrial enemy was created in continental Europe.With the invention of airplane, England could be attacked by an enemy with no navy.With the coming of oil's age, England (North Sea oil's reserves not found before the 1960's) had to import100% of his fuel.With both World wars, England's empire was sentenced to death. Protestantism in fact, like today, was ever divided in thounsands of cults, since his beginnings.If fact all kinds of protestantisms are image and similarity of his human creator, culture and society.Luther made a anti-semithic protestantism suc as himself.Calvin made a bank's friend protestantism, as himself was.And the England's king Henry VIII made an english protestantism.All reformator made a Jesus equal to himself.This fact is true until today.Protestantism don't make a society and culture.In fact a society and a culture makes a protestantism. The brazilian and latin american reality shows that protestantism itself don't make economical sucess.Here in Brazil, 80% of people who go to a church, go to a protestant (pentecostal) church.Do we have economical sucess with all this protestantism? NO!!!! This same fact happened in many parts of latin America.Bad economic results followed protestantism growing.El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua all are as protestants(pentecostals) as Brazil.All with bad economical results. About 35% of brazilian population are protestants, against about 80% of brazilian maids are protestants.In fact the brazilian protestants are, poorer than the general brazilian population.Also brazilian states with more protestants have bigger crime rates.In fact, more protestants, more crimes in Brazil.The poorest of all religious groups in Brazil are, the protestants(pentecostal).Only protestantism as a medicine for economical, political and cultural troubles is a quackery. Not a single african or latin american country had good economical results after protestantism's growing.At the same time, Spain with less than 1% of his population protestant, is an economical sucess.Italy and Portugal with only about 2% of protestants are also developed countries.  This book is a source with some good things to read.As I wrote up, Max Weber was an honest scholar, not a mad or a bigot.After all, Max Weber was looking to show us the reality, but he only wrote us rooted, in his own times, believes and realities.Every man is a prisioner of his times, friends and realities.And Max Weber wasn't an exception.          
 Here's a sampling from "The Iron Dragon's Daughter"  "Behind the bar was an enormous glass tank, lit by harsh fluorescents, where the rest of the club was bathed in red and purple. A horse was drowning in the tank. Legs churning up clouds of bubbles. Eyes bloodshot and wild, it craned it's neck to lift agonized nostrils above the thrashing surface. The music was slow and romantic, but just loud enough that the horse struggled in silence."  That is obscene. It made me physically ill to where I was sweating and sick my stomach. And we wonder why violence and abuse are becoming excepted/excusable behaviors. This sort of stuff, imo, doesn't help.  Swanwick ought to be ashamed of himself for even having such thoughts let alone putting them in a book where 70% of its readers will be kids.  What's a kid, or anyone for that matter, suppose to make of that bar w/ drowning horse scene? What's MS trying to say? That hey! slowly KILLING an innocent creature is COOL entertainment. All it said to me was just how much of a sick SOB Swanwick is.  Everybody in this book uses the "F" word along with every other foul word you can think of, copiously. The higher the page# the higher the "F" count.  I don't care what you're trying to do with a story, foul language will destroy, not enhance it. Just like in real life, foul language demeans and destroys. That's what it's all about.   In class one day Jane's teacher ("fat old Grunt") "Thrust his hand between her legs and snatched up at her crotch. The class convulsed with mirth, all of them braying, snorting, snickering, laughing as if they had never seen him pull this joke before."   Huh?    This is the rudest, crudest, foulest sci/fi fantasy book I've ever read.  AND to top it all off .. THERE IS NO STORY!  There is no rhyme nor reason.   Whether Swanwick likes it or not, as an author of mostly kid read books he has, imo, some moral and social responsibility. He dropped the ball here.  I've never given censorship a thought until this book.  But I'm asking my library to pull it off our shelves. I admit, I don't want anyone, especially kids, to read this book. It's pure ugly evil. It shats on you. It's an insult to your intelligence.   Of course Swanwick is laughing all the way to the bank.    
 There are SOOOO many GREAT books about wicca out there I certainly wouldn't waste my money again on this book, and I suggest others don't either. It is a lot of pop propaganda made to make wicca and witchcraft look like something out of the movies. It is full of false information made just to look cute so it will sell, sell, sell. This book is not for anyone who is seriously interested in learning Wicca or witchcraft in general.  This supposedly "advanced" book doesnt go into details on how to make your spells better, how to connect with nature, how to beome stornger. It doesnt encourage deep thinking and lots of factual information. It DOES however make the reader feel like they can just read a spell out loud from the book and it will all work in a puff of blue smoke. This book is not about a different of opinions or different practices, it is about portraying a real, serious, religion as a fun and games, do whatever you want choice as she mixes in things in tradtional witchcraft that has been shown to have the oppsite and/or nagative effects, as well as doing spells which do not follow the Wiccan rede.  Even though I am not in a coven I understand wicca is a religious choice and like any religion there are beliefs and redes which are followed. It is not 'do whatever you want to do and call yourself wiccan'. Yes some things in religion are personal choices but the building blocks of the religion are totally lost on her. Freedom of choice in religion is wonderful and its everyones right but if your choice is to make up your own religion you should not go around saying your wiccan when you do not follow the wiccan ways, Unfortunatly that is EXACTLY what ravenwolf does. She doesn't differentiate between the Wiccan and Paganism, in fact she barely cover the topics at all giving vague rehashed information from her other books. This book seems a nice commercial, cutesy items to make everything pretty and oh so shiny. This book is teaching hype not truths.   This book is demeaning and disrespectful to anyone into witchcraft and wicca alike. There are many good books which put things in simple, pleasant terms without all the false, goofy information spread thoughout this book.  Go pick up another book on whatever your interst (wicca, witchcraft, or paganism) and you will undoubtably end up more informed, this book will just leave you feeling broke. 
 The numerous historical inaccurracies are already outlined in other reviews.   Political correctness and post Cold War jingoism maquerading as hindsight are to blame for this farce of a war movie. Some of the historic elements (like Stalin's "not one step back" order, etc) are haphazardly crammed into a few opening scenes, creating an anachronistic mess. Unfortunately, there aren't many Soviet perspective films on Stalingrad to choose from.  Would recommend this film to those looking for simple suspenseful -- if predictable -- entertainment with the novelty of a war movie that's not from the "usual" U.S. or German WWII perspective. Would not recommend it for anyone interested in historical accuracy or complex and original plotlines 
 Jan Tomasz Gross' book "Neighbors:  the Destruction of  the Jewish Community in Jedwabne" was first published in Poland in early 2000 (under the Polish title `Sasiedzi: Historia Zaglady Zydowskiego Miasteczka'), and appeared in 2001 in American (English-language) and German editions.  `Neighbors' describes how a massacre of a number believed to be 1,600 Jews on July 10, 1941, in the village of Jedwabne near Lomza in northeastern Poland, which had hitherto been generally believed to be carried out by the German military, was actually carried out with Polish participation - according to Gross' account, it was organized and carried out by Poles, with German acquiescence.  The accusation that Poles were responsible for the Jedwabne massacre had an enormous impact on Polish public opinion.  A Polish governmental commission, the Institute of National Memory (Instytut Pamieci Narodowej, IPN) was charged with conducting a detailed investigation. IPN's findings were detailed in a 1500 page, two-volume study entitled `Wokol Jedwabnego' which unfortunately is presently available only in Polish. IPN's findings were made public on July 9th, 2002.    Gross' account in `Neighbors' is now known to be true in part, and in part inaccurate.  The fly-leaf of the hardcover edition of `Neighbors' summarizes the story as follows: `One summer day in 1941, half of the Polish town of Jedwabne murdered the other half - 1,600 men, women and children - all but seven of the town's Jews.'  According to IPN's investigation, this statement is inaccurate.   (1)   "1,600 (Jewish) men, women and children" were murdered (this statement in Gross' `Neighbors' has been repeated many times).  In fact, Jedwabne in 1941 did not have 1,600 Jewish inhabitants. An IPN historian, Jan Jerzy Milewski, found a 1940 Soviet NKVD document in the archive in Grodno showing that in Jedwabne in 1940 there were about 560 Jews.  Thus a year before the massacre, a Soviet census found the Jewish population of Jedwabne to be approximately one-third the number given by Jan T. Gross in `Neighbors'.  IPN's exhumation of the Jedwabne victims was interrupted at the request of the invited supervising Jewish rabbi that the remains of the victims not be further disturbed.  The best estimate of IPN's chief forensic investigator, Prof. Andrzej Kola, was that there were between 300 and 400 victims.  IPN concluded: `The figure of 1,600 victims or so seems highly unlikely, and it was not confirmed in the course of the investigation.'  (2)  `The Germans' direct participation in the mass murder.....was limited, pretty much, to their taking pictures' (Gross, `Neighbors'). This is false. In reality, IPN found, the day began "with the herding of Poles to the town square, which was done, according to witnesses, jointly by the German gendarmes, i.e. policemen and the people from the collaborating administration. In the testimonials there is mention of the fact that German policemen hit some of the Jedwabne Poles in the face with rifle butts or their hands, which is evidence that some of them did not want to go to the town square." The Germans then distributed bats and clubs to the Poles, to use as weapons against the Jews.  At the Jedwabne town square, the Germans were in charge.  The Germans were not in Jedwabne just as photographers, as Gross would have readers believe.  The Germans were in Jedwabne as organizers.  (3) "Half of the Polish town" murdered the other half: This is not accurate.  IPN, after interviewing 98 persons of whom about one-third were first-hand witnesses, concluded that "approximately at least forty men" were Polish perpetrators in the murder (but not "one half of the town" as stated on the fly-leaf of `Neighbors', which would have required over one thousand participants; Gross himself, in `Neighbors,' claims to have ninety-two names of Polish participants). Whether ninety-two according to Gross or "at least forty" in IPN's findings, the number of Polish participants in the Jedwabne massacre was not one-half of the village, but closer to one-twentieth.  An ACCURATE English-language version of IPN's principal findings, about 3 pages long, can be found on the Internet by going to `The Jedwabne Tragedy' at Buffalo University's `info-Poland' website, and then to `Jedwabne, July 10th, 1941: an interview with Prof. Pawel Machcewicz.'  Gross' book "Neighbors' was spectacularly successful in provoking an intensive two-year debate in Poland on the subject of Polish-Jewish relations.  An excellent collection of papers from that debate, in English translation, has been published under the title `The Neighbors Respond' edited by Joanna Michlic and Professor Antony Polonsky of Brandeis University.  `The Neighbors Respond' is not a rebuttal to `Neighbors', but examines the subject from many viewpoints. Those who want to better understand the subject, including what anti-Semitism was, and was not, in Poland, will learn far more - and in far greater depth - from `The Neighbors Respond'  than from reading `Neighbors' alone.  The greatest shortcoming of `Neighbors' is its inadequate treatment of events leading up to the 1941 Jedwabne massacre.  Gross never tells readers of `Neighbors' the most important thing which happened during the 1939 - 1941 Russian occupation of eastern Poland: the four massive deportations, from February 1940 to June 1941 (see Jan T. Gross, `Revolution from Abroad,' 2002 edition, pages 194-222, 262).  These deportations were atrocities, with women and children "packed in a standing position in sealed, windowless, and unheated cattle-wagons, for a winter journey of three, four, five or even six thousand miles.......instances of derangement, frostbite, starvation, infanticide and even cannibalism occurred."   (Norman Davies, `God's Playground,' Vol. 2, pages 448-449).    In Jedwabne, the deportation round-ups in June 1941, only a few weeks before the massacre, are described by IPN: "(Soviet) NKVD agents in groups of three, accompanied by members of the local militia, came looking for families of persons arrested or persons who had gone into hiding.  Jewish militia volunteers escorted the deportees, so they - in the eyes of many local Poles - were to blame for everything."   Many Jews in eastern (not in central) Poland, collaborated with the Russian occupation.  In many places, Jews welcomed Russian invaders.  Jewish-Soviet collaboration embittered Polish-Jewish relations during World War II and its aftermath.  
 I bought this based on the previous reviews. The book is very thin in content with about 250 cards per exam in the boook itself. It does not nearly cover the needed information.  The CD is better with more flash cards per exam, and a testing engine, but still thin in coverage and explanations.  It has information you can use, but not enough. If it was structured toward the exam requrements it would have been better. If you used the other Cisco press books, you don't need this, not even at the discounted price.  As a comparison, the CCNA flash cards book was much better. 
 The content of this book is only common sense steps... and targeted for completely disorganized people. For those using their brain before acting, do not buy this book: you won't find any secret, nor precious tips. But if you're a teen and wonder how to start a consulting business in the future: it could be a good investment. I bought the ebook edition, at least I didn't waste paper... Alan Weiss should learn more Japanese, because the word "sogomi" (at page 8!) doesn't exist. This mistake gives you the level of this book 
 I find it necessary to include the fact that I read this book for class and not from personal interest.  Though I agree with previous comments that the book was well written regarding style and grammar, I found reading this book to be a laborious task.  The author subjects himself to an experience with drugs, vomits, does not wake up for several days, and then continues to subject himself to this...repeatedly.  If anybody wishes to know what it is like to experience various narcotic trips after a white rabbit and is not inclined to read Alice in Wonderland, this is for you.  The book is basically a series of accounts of one man's experiences with wacky weed and magic mushrooms 
 The theme of this novel I believe is something around equality or injustice. But the author poorly displays the emotions and feelings, but the storyline about a poor painter who commits crimes weakens its affect. The life of a painter has little to do with injustice, and being deprived of splashing ink onto a canvas isn't a powerful topic, nor injustice in large quantities. If the story were something of higher stakes, the message would have been brought better. The works of Dalasquez have been forgotten in the snap of a finger. As stated before, the irrelavent topic of art is constantly replaced. Art is a fad, and I, Juan De Pareja is the tale of a painter being deprived of being part of a fad. If the author wants a tale of injustice involving fads, he could just capture the diary of a teenager 
 Deep play (aka "Flow") is a valuable concept, but don't expect to find any intelligent exposition of it here. Instead, prepare for confusion as seemingly disparate phenomena -- rituals, hallucinations brought on by starvation, and Sunday morning reveries in the park -- are evinced as examples of "deep play". Just how and why these should be lumped together with creative flow is never adequately explained.   All in all, this is a rambling, entirely unsystematic and underresearched book, notwithstanding the author's credentials as a naturalist.* Worse still, as Wolfgang Pauli would say, it is "not even wrong". It has nothing to say, for page after page after page.   Well, not nothing exactly. As an indulgent exercise in vanity, it's worth a titter or two. The author, whose photo reveals a woman of a certain age in King Charles-style tresses, loses no opportunity to remind you the reader that she knows how to live. "I hate the fearful trimming of possibilities that age brings. If you lead a relatively narrow life, I suppose you never notice. But I've always been athletic"... etc etc. Mostly she goes on in this vein, larding up her exploits with new age musings that even I --liberal, female and eco-minded-- found eminently gagworthy. Reader be warned, though: a dark episode intrudes on page 100, as Ackerman takes NASA to task for having had the temerity to reject her for the Journalist in Space program. Her explanation: NASA feared she might say something "wise and profound."[!]  Whatever the case, don't hold your breath waiting for her to say it in this book.   *Serious readers of psychology would do better to consult Czikszentmihalyi's outstanding research on "Flow", while those interested in play in the natural world will adore Bernd Heinrich's Mind of the Raven 
 me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films. And we do really like The Thin Red Line. But this was a real boring piece of film making.....The whole film was just one huge poetry reading and I prefer to read poetry from a book.....It just doesn't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by George Lucas.Even the battle scenes were just poetry readings..........Watch Thin Red Line instead if you are interested in this director's work...That film is a masterpiece....This isn't 
 fall asleep in  minutes what a joke.don`t waste your money on this product 
 unable to view because of incompatible format (as you warned me!)However, my ancestor James McLintock of Barnsley, Yorkshire, England sent John Wayne an eiderdown quilt for making the film (which is why I wanted the DVD)so..... 
 "Cyrano" is one of the greatest verse plays ever written.    Unfortunately Gerard Depardieu is no Cyrano.  He's a great, clumsy side of beef, not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of Hercule Sevanien Cyrano de Bergerac.  With the best will in the world, his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance.  The English translation was especially commissioned for this film.  It is undistinguished, prosy and dull.  It has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great American actor Walter Passmore.  Get the Jose Ferrer version.  This one's a dog 
 out of all the garbage I have heard(Mase's double up and Silk's made men)This is by far the WORST Rap album I have ever heard in my life! They dont even rap on all of the songs and the skits are dumb and not funny.  This is the worst album ever! Ever! Go and buy it, I bet you wont even  trade it in but you will throw it away. This is the Girl 6 of albums,  Hugo(car) of albums. I want you to buy it so you can feel what I feel 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 This book has a few pieces of useful information ... but overall there are many much better books out there about generations and how they differ (e.g., Generation Me, When Generations Collide, Generations). The authors take a spattering of information from other sources (they are not researchers or policy makers themselves), tell a few narratives, and that's about it. You are much better off buying another book on generations.   Also, notice the publisher: Focus on the Family. Thus the book is written from an explictly stated Christian perspective. For some readers this might be a bonus; others might be put off by this in a book that is not about religion 
 for ads only pretty much. there is not much to read or learn for the common reader. it seems like it's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone. 
 This book is an enjoyable read if you have nothing better to do.  I failed to be captivated by it.  The characters lack the heartwrenching dramatic intensity that you find in her other works.  Maybe it is because Alice Walker is such a phenominal author that people just expect so much from her.  Still, this book is NOT making the cut for my personal library 
 When you buy a name like Sony, you expect to get decent stuff.  This DVD Recorder failed miserably.  No S-Video inputs in the rear so you have to run S-Video to the front panel (which my 2 year old loved to unplug).  Nice editing features if you have the time.  Unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done (who knows if I will get it back).  I replaced it with a Lite-On DVD recorder (at less than half the price) and am very happy with it 
 It apparently doesn't strike people as odd that Bush does not belong to a congregation and rarely goes to any church. Too busy? He spends more time on vacation than any President in history. Too disruptive? Carter not only attended a Washington Baptist church every Sunday, but taught Sunday school. Bush isn't alone; Reagan didn't attend church while President, either 
 Oh Nicholson Baker, just when I'm about to crown you my favorite and grudgingly pass all of your books along to my best friends, I read "A Box of Matches," a novel which is less novel than a writing exercise legitimized as literature by a printer. I was shocked by "VOX" and fawned over "The Fermata," I even loved "Double Fold," his non-fiction turn on the assault on paper.  But this book will make most of you feel like you are wasting your time.  A man wakes up every morning around five, lights a match, and thinks.  That's it.  His thoughts range from piquant to gross to nostalgic to melancholy.  I'm not the kind of reader to expect world-changing events to take place in my literature.  But I do like to care about my characters -- and this guy didn't cut it.  Pick up one of Baker's other, more worthwhile books 
 I read this book as a requirement for a class in eschatology in seminary. Pentecost block-quotes other authors for about 60 percent of his text, at which point he could've just provided a bibliography. There is little originality in thought here. Pentecost surveys the narrow world of premillenial dispensationalism and says anyone who disagrees with his viewpoint does not take the text "literally" and ignores the "clear, plain meaning of scripture." But his hermeneutic is a bit inconsistent. He insists that various parts of the apocalyptic imagery presented in Revelation, Daniel and other parts of the Bible must be taken literally.   But he then turns around and says the odd beasts in the Revelation are figurative. Okay...who's not being "literal" here?  Like too many evangelical theologians, Pentecost has no concept of how apocalyptic worked in the Second Temple period. I would imagine that, having translated the Testaments of the XII Patriarchs, I've done more background work than he did in the area (unless reading the notes in the Scofield Bible counts).  Instead, he spends all of his time demonizing those blasted amillenialists. An enormous waste of time and energy.  Then again, the book is almost 600 pages long, and uneducated people are always impressed when they see you reading something large. But for my money, you could learn more about how to live like Christ in the light of his imminent coming (the point of eschatology) by reading an even bigger book you probably already own: the yellow one with restaurant listings 
 As a die-hard Cathy fan, just bought this book without looking at it..expected more cartoons, a larger book.  The recipes seem to be those you can find in any cookbook - mashed potatoes?? hot fudge sauce??  Very disappointed.  If there was more about Cathy in the book it might be worth it..but this was waste of money 
 If you're going to parody the countless number of straight teen comedies, at least make your movie funnier and smarter than they are. This movie is neither and doesn't credit its audience as having any intellect whatsoever.   I have nothing against lowbrow comedy, but the jokes and gags here are just plain tired. Is over-douching yourself to the point of constant crapping funny to anyone over the age of 12? Jokes about gerbils and NAMBLA - c'mon. I know I'll get hell for taking my gay self too seriously, but gerbil jokes and NAMBLA being equated with being gay is offensive. Maybe if their respective jokes were funny I'd feel differently, but they were anything but. Just stupid.   If there is a redeeming factor to this movie, it's the attractive actors, but that's really it. 
 I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice 
 Foxwold (his review is above mine), gave no stars to this book but I give it one. Ultimately, I think Foxwold is right that the author doesn't appear to really be an enthusiast about the history of spices.   The book is not a comprehensive view of the subject by any means, but I would still enjoy the it as a whole had it mitigated against the normal 'dry' result of reference works by being an interesting read. Dalby doesn't manage to do this at all... The style of writing is not nicely flowing and the way in which the information is organized is sterile and uninteresting. I gave him one star because I learned a FEW interesting things while reading it but ... if I am not looking at an encyclopedia or a reference text, then I want my reading material to be stimulating too 
 This book is well-written and contains fascinating information, especially in the early sections dealing with Berlin's pre-Germanic, Slavic history. Later on, the bloody  Soviet assault on the city in 1945 against ferocious resistance is depicted magnificiently, while Richie's account of atrocities committed by Soviet troops is truly horrifying.       Where Faust's Metropolis runs into trouble is in the author's tendency to slip into factual errors and in her more  pronounced tendency to present her reactionary political  interpretations as indisputable depictions of reality.                                                              Some of the factual errors are relatively minor; an example would be her assertion that during World War I the expensive German battleships were never used. Actually, they were used - against the British at Jutland, one of the most spectacular naval battles ever fought. In addition, she actually believes, or claims to believe, that Britain entered World War I to protect the neutrality rights of Belgium. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the War knows that the British themselves initially planned to invade neutral Holland in order to strike at Germany; the plan was abandoned out of military considerations, not legal or ethical ones.                                                                 More serious are the errors brought on by the author's hatred of Marxism. One need not be an admirer of Stalin in order to realize that her claim that he spurned Britain and France in order to sign a pact with Hitler is pure nonsense. Stalin signed the pact only after the Western allies refused to sign an alliance with him, hoping that the Germans would attack the U.S.S.R. rather than Poland and France. Another area in which she substitutes fantasy for history is in her treatment of Generals Montgomery and Patton and their conflicts with Eisenhower. Both are presented as heroic in their eagerness to provoke a confrontation with the Soviets; Patton, she tells us, was fired "because the Americans would not allow anyone to sour relations with Stalin." Actually, Eisenhower removed Patton from his command after he disobeyed direct orders to stop associating with Nazis and openly planning for World War III. Montgomery, another head case, is lauded for his plan to dash accross Germany and seize Berlin just as it was in the grasp of the Soviets. Somehow he emerges as the hero of the Battle of the Bulge; Richie contends that Eisenhower "hid in his headquarters" during the battle because he feared that the Germans would try to assassinate him.                                                                   Richie's treatment of the G.D.R. after the War reads like one of those pamphlets I was given to read in grade school - the ones written by J.Edgar Hoover or Cardinal Spellman. She finds nothing good about East Germany, not even free, guaranteed medical care or daycare for children, which are described as "rigid social benefits." What are non-rigid social benefits? The kind you get in the form of a trust account or monthly checks from an affluent mommy and daddy? Sometimes her denunciations take on a hysterical tone, as when she declares that the Evangelical Church of the G.D.R. (which made a point of attacking racism and human inequality) was "was very much the successor of Hitler's 'National Church.'" Ravings like this pass beyond the borders of muddled thinking and sloppy scholarlship and enter that of ideological fanaticism.                                                            Richie sides with every cold war hardliner she comes accross, from Richard Pipes to James Baker. Detente was a big mistake, we are assured, because it gave the Soviets military superiority in Europe; why they didn't use it to evict the West is not explained. Willy Brandt's opening to the East was also a no-no; he should have followed the Christian Democrats in blindly following the U.S. Ronald Reagan is a big hero; his absurd Star Wars plan, Richie thinks, is what led to the fall of the Soviet Union and the G.D.R. One has to wonder about the judgement of an author who believes that Reagan, whose government financed the Guatemalan and Salvadoran death squads, stood for international freedom and justice.                                                              In a lengthy and sanctimonious afterward the author's right-wing agenda becomes even more explicit.  she lectures West Berliners that "the road away from the United  States is the road to disaster" and insults Willy Brandt's widow as "pathetic" for begging to differ. She also lumps the Greens ("dreamy environmentalists") and Berlin's new leftists in with vicious neo-Nazis as opponents of U.S. leadership.                                                           At some points in this book Richie seems to reject the concept of collective guilt for the Holocaust, at other points she wants the Communists, who themselves were murdered, jailed or forced into exile by the Nazis, to assume responsibility for it. In the afterward  she encourages "all Berliners ... to try to be worthy of forgiveness." This will probably happen around the same time that British Tories accept responsibility for Britain's leading role in the slave trade and for the genocical witholding of food during the Irish Potato Famine.                                                               One last point. For someone who throws around so many phrases about freedom and democracy, Richie seems to have a rather odd idea of how this works out in practice. As a sign of "hope and optimism" she notes that "hard-line East German teachers were barred from schools" after reunification. In other words, Marxist teachers were fired, as they were in the U.S. in the McCarthy Era. The old Tory interpretation of individual rights - Of course you have freedom of speech. All we ask is that you don't try to exercise it 
 Don't get me wrong. I'm a big fan of Beverly Hills 90210 but after purchasing this dvd i got so mad. Where have all the songs gone? Seeing this series with songs that you don't eaven know who is singing.  I just saw the pilot episode, i couldn't see the rest of it. It's really, really bad. Where is "Motion of love" when Brenda gets inside the disco all by herself ??????  Where are Technotronic, Transvision Vamp, where is Chris Isaak, REM, Betty Boo ??????  We waited a long time for this dvds and all we get is this piece of junk. Who did this and why????  Don't purchase this dvds. They are not worht your money. The bootlegs are better !!!! 
 Episode two of the hunt for the bumbling master spy(Peacemaker) is an improvement over the unfortunate initial episode, No Graves as Yet. There are some good scenes: the beaches at Gallipoli, the amusing downfall of Judy's competitor for the General's wheel, the encounter with the German sub, etc.  But we still have the preposterous underlying theme that George V would trade continental Europe for German help in retaking the United States for the British Empire. That task made more difficult as Miss Perry has Mexican armies pouring over the Southwestern border to conquer the U.S. Even Zimmerman didn't expect that much.  Then there is Private Corliss who dominates the opening chapters by suffering a crushed hand, a suspected Self Inflicted Wound(SIW), for which he is court martialed and sentenced to death.  In WWI, the test for an SIW was whether the injury was caused by British ammunition, not the case here. There were 3,894 recorded SIWs in the British Army during the war; the penalty was a prison sentence. No one was subject to the death penalty for an SIW. We have Chaplain Joseph who spends half the book playing police detective; a general in command of substantial forces at Ypres who spends most of his time with his attractive driver and seems to have no contact with his regimental commanders or the battles; a reporter for a small newspaper chain whose accurate depiction from Gallipoli would cause millions of Britons to abandon the war, even though the millions had already heard the truth from their sons, daughters, and husbands; etc. On the bright side, there is a new Pitt mystery, Long Spoon Lane, where Miss Perry makes us feel right at home in both the drawing rooms and the slums of Victorian London.  IMO her reach toward World War I is a war too far. 
 This DVD is dated, and lacks the eroticism and/or nudity you would expect in a women prison movie.  I bought the "Unrated" version, but I wonder what that rating was based on.  I have bought several "R" rated movies in the women prison genre that were rather hot, but compared to this 1969 rubbish they were volcanic.  I was sincerely disapointed, and wished I had read some of the reviews prior to purchasing this dreadful movie 
 Ever read a good Petzold book?  This isnt like that at all.   All I can add is ditto to what someone else has said.  ---------------------- I am very disappointed. While techically accurate and covering a large amount of topics, this book has been a pain to read even for a very interested and curious programmer like me. The writing style is annoying at best. -------------- The book is very difficult to follow it just does not flow and concentrates too much on things that mean little or nothing. 
 This book contains very few pictures. Basically it's for novel-lovers, not for handy-man. I noticed most good ratings for this book are from women ... 
 The author of this book should have never received his degree. The book is very confusing and vaguely describes any mathematical process in arriving to its conclusions. An example of this is in chapter two where the author attempts to describe call blocking but ignores any input traffic to the system. The author obtains values from thin air and does not describe how the process used in obtaining the answers. This type of confusing gibberish is seen through out the book. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this book 
 We Can Build You is one of PKD's weakest books. It starts in a quite interesting way, but ultimately leads nowhere. The best ideas are discarded and the end of the book concentrates in the lead character's descend into schizophrenia - and even that is not interesting in any way (unlike in some other Dick's books). Recommended only for Philip K. Dick completists 
 The orphanage is neat, and is portrayed in a nice, familyish way.  The care that is shown there is touching.  Beyond that, I search for someone that stands out as true, genuine, and responsible, and I don't find one.  The meaninglessness of life without God is starkly portrayed 
 I cant say that I wasn't disappointed with this book. I had high hopes for Mona, but this book was so dull I wanted to cry. I try my hardest to make it to the end, and unbelievably I did. The ending was laughable, and not in a good way. One of the WORST I have ever read 
 This book is exactly the same as "Handbook of Technical Writing" by same authors. The only difference is in the cover picture and colors. I think it is not a cool thing to sell the same book with two names without mentioning it. So if you have that one, do not buy this one. They are exactly the same 
 Actually, This CD consists of 6 fine Irish instrumental pieces and 9 average pop recordings which are not at all complementary.  The title track's chorus, for instance, is repeated 17 times in just over 4 minutes & many other of the Corrs' own compositions included herein are equally inane and repetitive; so much so that I'm inclined to think that the Irish instrumentals subtrack from this album more than they add to it.  The pop songs could then just be accepted as conventional popular music then & we wouldn't be exposed to the disconnect that is apparent when we have the Irish instrumentals to compare to it.  Consequently, this CD feels like an album of the Chieftains randomly mixed up with something from the likes of Belinda Carlisle, Debbie Gibson, Shania Twain, or Brittany Spears.  If you are a popular musc fan, take your pick elsewhere & if you are looking for Irish music try sampling something from Sinead O'Conner (perhaps the CD, Sean-Nos Nua), anything from Enya, and/or something from Clannad.  Cheers 
 This was a difficult book to read. The author had a tendancy to switch between scenes. No space, no line, no star. While this may work for Thomas Pynchon, it just made this book unpleasant to read. Besides this, the characters were a bit flat. I didn't like Druss much at all. I pictured him the entire time as a dwarf. The first half of the book I did not enjoy the plot much at all. Near the second half of the book the author hit his stride and reading was easy and fun. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one.  The end was predictable. Well, predictable except for the way the author pulled solutions for everyone's problems out of his posterior. The stuff at the end just felt like the author lost momentum and made up a way to tie off all the plot lines. Very unsatisfying. I know I won't continue this series 
 So what kind of movie is this from the director of "I know what you did last summer?" It's basically another installment of the same genre with a similar set-up and similar function. Deep down, Venom is just another teen slasher movie. They rode into this film with the same clichéd scares, a young group of teens, a psycho killer, and a traditional ending.   So is it worth seeing?   That I can't completely answer for you. If you like more of the same old, then it's probably going to be a blast. The filmmakers were smart enough to throw in a few thrilling moments among the mundane, overused plot. I found some parts to be slightly unpredictable, and they did a good job detailing some suspenseful moments near the third act of the film. The voodoo element allowed for some additional surprises and kept the killer from being simply "an unstoppable evil force."  But individually, do the separate factors of this film combine to make a masterpiece? Quite frankly, in my opinion at least....no.  Let's take a look at some of them;  Acting- Well done, well directed too I might add. The acting is realistic to a degree, and brings us into the film. The actors responded (for the most part) realistically to the story line and I think that this was set-up nicely. The major issue here was the persistence in finding a gun when the killer is already dead, not to mention a demon child of voodoo hoodoo.   Lighting- Dim, dark and mysterious; the lighting definitely amplified the mood of this film. Combined with the swamp-like location, I think that it sets a perfect example of what a good location combined with good lighting can do- make a relatively unattractive plot look beautiful.   Special Effects- They set this up pretty well. A few scenes made me cringe and I felt that the artists working on the film definitely put their hearts into it...or bled them out for it. The gore wasn't excessive, but just right for a slasher film, and props to the director for making that call. My only qualm with this is that they used the standard Halloween "stage blood" which is just basically a thick bright red liquid that looks nothing like blood despite its color. A few of the actors squirm around in it, only to look like they're rolling around in pizza sauce. There are a few other tacky special effects, including the last major one in the film.   The Killer- Mr. Jangles....? Enough said...sounds like a dog. I'll give the killer credit for being a good actor, but the portrayal needed a lot of work. The make-up kicked it up a notch, but the slow-motion style jumps and action-movie style stunts didn't do it justice. The man looked like an athlete and moved like one...not like a reincarnated being housing the souls of 13 evil spirits. Although I don't specifically know what that looks like....I'm sure they don't run like football players.  So what overall? It's ok. Not something I'd be dying to see, and I'm glad that I didn't run to the theatre to catch the first showing. It has some good moments and some bad, but doesn't really stand out from any normal Hollywood production.   My recommendation?   It's ok. I'd rather go rent Containment instead; the first movie in a long time to completely blow my mind. It's good to know that there is still some talent out there somewhere and that it still filters into the film world now and again... 
 I was reluctant to read this book because I didn't enjoy the first installment of the trilogy much.  Wow, how right I was!!! Since I first read the story by Beroul, in High School, many, many years ago, I loved it. So beautiful yet so tragic.  Cross-stared lovers in the resemblance of Romeo and Juliette.  How magnificent!   But I have never read of a sadder Tristan, even to the point of being ridiculous, and taking this book into account, I wonder how Tristan and Isolde and their love story have made it through time. 
   Great book, of course, but for this edition Oxford used a computer to justify the  type. On every other line you encounter three or four spaces   where there should be  only one. It may not bother most readers, but I'm looking for another    publisher's edition 
 I agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious, self-indulgent, ego-fest. Wallace is obviously highly intelligent, and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that.   It all starts off well enough. The characters are quirky and interesting. At first. And Wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what's going to happen. But nothing ever really happens. And at some point I just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives.   Ultimately, this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect. And while that exercise may have been rewarding for Wallace, it wasn't so terribly rewarding for the reader.  
 I have used other books of this kind in the past for other countries. This one seem to lack the fundamentals for this type of informational book. #1 You must write this book for someone who is not familiar with the local surroundings or the languages. #2 In the years that will be called the new millinneum people want to just blow in and blow out. When I travel I have a limited time and budget to see the flea markets available. In this book there is alot of leg work the author could have provided but for some reason did not.#3 If you speak fluent italian you can call all the phone #'s provided if they are still current. I on the other hand will have to hire a translator. If the author would provide maps, locations to trains, location to major city monuments, and make things easy for the reader to find, the hidden treasures she has found would be available to her reader, which should be her goal. When I travel many times I have up to 5 days in which to find this type of treasure. With this book it would be difficult to accomplish what I would like, but with more effort from the author this book could be a complete guide for any traveler 
 ...but it stopped working after a year. The only thing the lens sees now is black, although the camera still turns on and I can look at pictures I took before the problem started. Nonetheless, I loved this camera, and I think it was worth it, even though it only worked a year. Now I've learned my lesson and will buy a longer warranty or exchange for m new camera 
 This book wants to make you a Christian, it tells you that Mo is bad and Jesus is good. It's very unfair as it trumpets the merits of Jesus while saying Mo was cruel and self-indulgent.  ..but it makes no mention of Jesus's bad points and the nasty bits in the New testament where for instance Jesus encourages the beating of slaves (Luke 12:47) and the bit where Jesus tells you to burn unbelievers (John 15:6, Matthew 13:41-42).  Dr Gabriel obviously loves Jesus and hates Muhammad but for all Muhammad's faults he wasn't dumb enough to curse a fig-tree for not bearing fruit while it was out of season (Matthew 21:18-19, Mark 11:13-14).  Dr Gabriel also tells you with relish that Muhammad stole from trade caravans by going on ghazi raids on enemy merchants but he fails to point out that Jesus broke the law by stealing corn on the Sabbath (Mark 2:23), and he encouraged his disciples to take a horse without asking permission (Matthew 21).  The point i'm trying to make (rather laboriously) is that neither Jesus or Mo were perfect and that both men did some awful things in their times and great suffering has often resulted from their respective legacies and folks like Dr Gabriel don't help us understand things by selectively reading the bible and quran and dissing one guy while extolling the merits of the other.   this really is a stupid and infantile book ...does this guy really have a PhD? 
 I was disappointed in this book when I received it.  I was looking for ways to make my H.S. History class more exciting, but I found that most of the suggestions in the book were geared more for the elementary school  levels.  The format of the book is set-up more like a comic book than an  academic book and is filled with cartoon drawings and funny sayings.   Although it was fun to read, I really did not feel that I acquired any  useful knowledge from it 
 Jane Smiley's _A_Thousand_Acres_ had a great deal of potential.  It had a powerful plot (King Lear) that has been little-adapted in modern times.  Smiley chose an interesting and rich setting in her modern day heartland farm.  However, the actual execution of the book leaves much to be desired.  First and foremost, Smiley writes exactly like a writer who has just completed a college writing program.  She uses smart and subtle humor (one may say wit), metaphors and similes.  The problem is that one is conscious at each and every juncture that she is using a simile, a metaphor, or a quip.  While more seasoned writers might have woven beauty into readable text or else have chosen to complexify and engage a reader, instead she chose a middleground that is neither challenging nor readable.  The reader constantly is forced to swallow some rather ridiculous metaphors, all the while conscious that they are swallowing a textbook, but ridiculous, metaphor.  And while the plot taken from Shakespeare had a lot of potential, it was handled quite inexpertly.  Yes, Smiley chose the intelligent path and abandoned Lear about 3/4 of the way through (so that everyone doesn't die).  However, once again, she writes in a way that makes every reader -conscious- that she is adapting Shakespeare, and at times the plot seems ridiculous in its current setting.  Yes, she sheds new light (the protagonist is the Goneril-character, who was a Shakespearean antagonist) in a very intriguing way.  Yes, she invents new excuses for her behavior (former child abuse)... however, had she not tried so hard to make the reader conscious that she was adapting Shakespeare, these plausable interpretations might not have seemed -in-plausable.  All in all, a book with many potent seeds that were not sown to anything near their full value 
 Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews below before I bought this DVD.  It's a travesty of the DVD medium.  Perhaps Fox Lorber took the story of the movie too seriously:  they've produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy.  Don't waste your money on it 
 Derek Hutchinson has led kayaking expeditions around the world and teaches  highly regarded seminars on the sport.  However, he seems unable to clearly  translate this teaching ability to print.  This book reads like a laundry  list of things to do in a kayak: equipment choices, paddle strokes, rescue  techniques, rolling, surfing maneuvers, etc.; without rhyme or reason as to  their purpose or when they should be executed.  The book does cover a  complete range of topics relevant to the sea kayaker: all topics just  mentioned plus weather, tides, navigation, wind, etc. Unfortunately, many  sections are out-of-date, such as the equipment section; a lot of  information, such as that on nautical charts and on weather, is specific to  kayaking in Britain; and some information, such as that on tidal currents,  is just plain wrong.  I did learn quite a lot from the sections on turning  strokes and eskimo rolling, but not as much as I feel I should have and not  enough to know where or when to use a particular technique.  Overall, I was  disappointed with the quality of instruction presented in this book 
 While this story is truly an essential writing of Dostoevsky, it lacks the appropriate context to be read as sold in this copy.  If you are interested in reading "The Grand Inquisitor" without reading the rest of The Brothers Karamazov, I would recommend the Guignon edition, sold for only a little more.  This work includes the two chapters preceeding "The Grand Inquisitor" as well as what Dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale, "The Russian Monk," which follows this legend.  Dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole, but I think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy.  Additionally, this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by Charles Guignon, which is much more informative than the brief one by Anne Fremantle provided in this copy.  It is important to remember that "The Grand Inquistor" was not Dostoevsky's final answer in The Brothers Karamazov.  Reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both Dostoevsky's writing and philosophy and The Brothers Karamazov.  I would recommend reading the book as a whole instead [and I particularly recommend the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation for that: it is much more accurate to the original Russian].  Or at a minimum, reading the other edition of this book.  Either way, you will get a more complete glimpse to the genius of Dostoevsky, which this fails to provide.  The Grand Inquisitor is truly an essential read, but not in this presentation of it 
 Hate to admit it but this just isn't very good.  Been a fan since 'Slowhand' so i've been frequently disappointed and underwhelmed by Clapton, but this is just amazing.  This has everything going for it but it just doesn't come together.  The featured review by 'Woomer' mirrors my feelings that nothing since 'From the Cradle' has been worthwhile barring 'Riding with the King' and that was helped immensely by King himself.  Toss this onto the heap along with 'Reptile' and 'Pilgrim' 
 This book is very poorly organized, the "French dictionary" contained no useful phrases, and the maps were terrible!! I would definitely choose something more comprehensive & buy a separate city map 
 I, too, live by the beach and appreciate the fun and beauty and solace it offers beyond measure. And while I'm sure that the Hubals are wonderful people, this book is unbelievably trite and oozes with over-the-top sentimentality. For example, #88 titled Cry or #93, "Make a wish and write in the sand with a feather." Entries also lean to the bizzare: #87 "Let a child take pictures of you"--the Hubals suggest "borrowing a child from a friendly family" if you don't have a child of your own. And #83--I agree watching dogs play at the beach is entertaining, but the mention that your dog will be delighted that there are "dead things to smell"is just too too much. And #79: "Give some money away" never even mentions the beach or the ocean--were editors sleeping during this tangent? For those of you who are Saturday Night Live fans, this book puts "Deep Thoughts" to shame. Unless you're looking for a good laugh or enjoy the sappiest of sappy books, pass this one up 
 This was a howler... Brown is so ignorant about intelligence gathering, computers, and NSA that there was no way to suspend disbelief and just go for the ride. Brown needs to learn to research his storylines, and then he needs to learn to write a lot better (even DaVinci Code suffered from bad writing), and he needs a better editor who will guide him on his way 
 watch out for false starements in this book. many good pics except for the one ... that doesn't even look like lucy. so beware if you love lucy watch what you believe--Step 
 I think that Chip Davis has run out of creativity with this pitiful offering.  Of the thousands of CDs that I own, the original Mannheim Christmas is among my favorites.  This is about as opposite in my collection as one could get.  Great concept, poor realization 
 I'm amazed this book received so many good reviews, the only reason I can see is that the reviewers are all Managers or it's a sign of a skewed process.  Anyway the books own description should give it away "Intended for both business people and technologists".  What are the chances of that being true?  I'd say none.  Basically this is a Managers book with all the consultant doublespeak you'd expect.  It's written from such a high level it will give you nose bleed and makes tons of assumptions that only a Manager would buy into.  If you are a techie and buy this book you will waste your time at best and learn misleading/incorrect info at worse 
 I had high hopes for this, expecting a bigger dose of Maureen's refreshing liberal arguments and interesting points.  No such luck.  It's hard to start the analysis considering how she jumps from point to point throughout the book and throughout each chapter.  You'd think the title might give it focus, but that very question doesn't even come up until the mid-point of the book (about where I am now; not sure I have the will to finish), and her wittest method of answering it is some cutesy tangent about genetics and how sperm is no longer necessary to fertilize eggs.  harharhar.  Up until that point, it's mostly a collection of random rants and anecdotes about how men supposedly can't handle women who are smarter than them or make more money, etc.  Also, that all these societal standards are the fault of men, completely omitting women's responsibility in upholding them.  (Get a clue: women are at least as insistent on the man being richer or more powerful no matter her standing, just like women expect the man to be taller no matter her height.)  If Maureen truly believes men desire ditzes, maybe she can find comfort in knowing the release of this book just increased her compatibility 
 Poorly written. Brutal content. Chinese portrayed as barbaric people with animalistic behavior. Lalu's father sells her to bandits knowing 50 men plan to gang rape her to death.Refers to how her dark skin lessens value. Lalu, 13, contemplates suicide as an honorable solution. The bandits draw lots to see who goes first. 43 is upset because she will be "mushy" by his turn. She is sold to a brothel, ends up in a saloon owned by Hong King,a cruel man who rapes and prostitutes her. Writing painfully too simple. After the first 100 pages, most of this book moves slowly like an amatuer biography written by a family member about grandma. A boring, brutal book written at a 1st grade level. Can be disturbing to those sensitive about children being raped 
 I've read several books on this subject, talked to refugees and know many people in the information gathering sector.  Had I not known, for example, why Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and 1982, Amal's treatment of the subject would have left me with the conclusion that Israel didn't have anything better to do than to aggress its neighbor.  She never mentions the reasons why Israel attacked and acutally intimates that Israeli soldiers carried out the Sabra massacre.  This book is simply a detailed propoganda instrument for Islam, Iran and Hizbu'llah.  She contradicts herself in many instances, and sometimes on the same page (first it's morally, religiously and politically wrong to take hostages and declares Hizbu'llah leadership strictly proscribe it but 2 paragraphs later it's OK, justifiable and sanctionable--which is it?!).  I understand that anytime you try to justify what terrorists do in a logical sense, you'll have to switch back and forth regularly.  She just isn't very adroit in how she does it.  What isn't addressed is the simple fact that the reason Hizbu'llah exists is because they want control of Lebanon so they can unite with Iran under an Islamic Republic.  They can't get the Lebanese people to go along with them and so the only explanation Amal and Hiz can put forward is that it must be due to US and Israeli meddling.  The reality is, no logical, rational human being would ever go along with their extremist views and that's why they are unsuccessful.  This book only allows a distrust of the West and Israel while justifying everything Hizbu'llah has done as honorable, justified and moral.  On the other hand, this does give the reader a very good idea how members of Hizbu'llah think.  She certainly is able to convey their thought process, being that she clearly shares their views, and spares no quotation to expound on why destroying Israel is a noble objective.  The reader will have to go elsewhere to find a complete history that shows what the US and other countries have done to help the region (like the fact that the West, the Pioneer of Evils, the First Root of Vice, the Great Satan, etc. aka the United States liberated the Middle-East twice from German control and then left -- i.e. no imperialistic motives gang).  Anytime we give them aid, this work twists it into an attack on Islamic sovereignty.  For Hizbu'llah, attacking Israel as it invades is OK because it's a defensive action.  However, Israel attacked in '78 and '82 because PLO terrorists were launching missile strikes from Southern Lebanon.  By their skewed logic, it's not OK for Israel to defend itself and its citizens but it is OK for an Islamic group to do the same.  The double standards in this missive are abundant and transparent.  The only use for this book is to know how the enemy thinks and to see how tenuous their justifications for attacks truly are 
 This is a good introduction to Tchaikovsky for the beginner that gives a broad sampling of his work. Considering the price, it's a good value if someone is just wanting to begin exploring classical music or Tchaikovsky in particular. However, the sound quality on this albumn is quite poor and there are much higher quality Tchaikovsky recordings available 
 This book deserves no stars.   PLEASE stop buying and promoting this rotten book! This is a book about a rotten, selfish self-centered male who takes everything including the life of the female tree. Even at the end when he chops her down to sit on her as an old man, he's still unsatisifed and has a big scowl on his face!  The female tree gives and gives and gives, and the male (from boy to old man) just takes and takes and takes and is never satisified, happy or thankful.  What kind of story is that?  This is truly a rotten story. Don't buy it! Don't give this to your children! 
 Books have been written, and will continue to be written, to try and disprove Christianity and Jesus as the Son of God. What is almost comical is that one has to print lies and errors to try and convince people. That's because you can't disprove the TRUTH. And what are some of the errors, you ask? I will give you a few: Dan Brown tries to use Gnostic gospels (gospels written in the 2nd century and beyond by people who were not eyewitnesses) to try and prove his theory and omitting New Testament Scripture. To say that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married by using the Gospel of Phillip (written after 250 A.D.) where there are missing words: And the companion of the [...] Mary Magdalene. [...] more than [...] the disciples, [...] kiss her [...] on her [...]. Clearly, there is some problems with this text with the missing words and the fact that it was written over 200 years after Jesus died. This does not prove anything. Also, he says that the word "companion" means spouse in Aramaic, which is great, except that the Gospel of Philip was written in "Coptic," where "companion" does not mean "spouse!" Second, Dan Brown says that it wasn't until 325 AD at the Council of Nicea did people start to believe Jesus was a Deity and that it was a close vote. New Testament disproves that because it shows that Jesus was Deity where Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 15:3-5: "For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve." Also, The Council of Nicea met only to sort out some differences among church leaders, all of whom believed that Jesus was divine. The main question was whether Jesus was begotten or made. Jesus' divinity, death and resurrection were not in question. Only two of 318 clerics at the Council did not sign the Nicene Creed. So there was not a close vote unless you think 318 to 2 is close! Third, his main argument is that it Mary Magdalene in the Last Supper painting by Leo. If that were true, then where is John, the youngest and most beloved apostle? John was often portrayed in a feminine manner to convey youth, as is seen in many stained glass portraits in European cathedrals. And also, Leo was just a painter who was not around when Jesus was, so it didn't matter if he tried to put Mary in a painting or not! Fourth, Brown says that The Gnostic gospels and the Dead Sea Scrolls are "the earliest Christian records." While the New Testament obviously came before the Gnostic gospels, The Dead Sea Scrolls refer to a collection of about 900 documents, many of which are fragmentary scrolls written in Hebrew, Greek and Aramaic, that were discovered in a cave and do not contain even a single mention of Jesus or of any other person mentioned in the New Testament as they are Jewish documents! He also says they were discovered in the 1950's when they were discovered in 1947. Oops! Fifth, Dan Brown says that Christianity borrowed its beliefs from the pagan religion of Mithraism. He says that Mithraism worshipped the pre-Christian God Mithras, called the Son of God and Light of the World, who was born on December 25th, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days. Scholars of Mithraism would strongly disagree with Brown on all of these points. Nowhere is Mithras given the title Son of God and the Light of the World. Brown apparently made this up because it sounded good. Mithras was born on December 25th, however this proves nothing. The New Testament never associated December 25th with the birth of Christ. The early Christians chose to celebrate the birth of Christ on this day intentionally to oppose the pagan mid-winter festival of Saturnalia. They never claimed Jesus was actually born on that date. The claim that Mithras died and was buried in a rock tomb is just not true. Scholars will tell you that in Mithraism there is no death of Mithras at all. So, there was no rock tomb and no resurrection. So once again, he is nowhere near correct. Lastly, Brown says that the four canonical gospels were chosen from over 80 gospels. First, there were only less than half that many books written about Jesus life. The two Gnostic gospels Brown relies on most heavily weren't written until the second century A.D., long after the New Testament gospels were written. It makes sense that the Gnostic gospels came about in the late second century, as this is when Gnostic thought was most prevalent. However, the New Testament was complete before the end of the 1st Century. Also, the Gospel of Thomas, which Dan Brown lies heavily on,claims women must become men in order to receive salvation. That makes no sense. There are many other errors in this novel, but I think I have showed there are enough lies in this book not to be taken seriously. This is pure (or rather "poor") fiction, without a shred of evidence that Jesus was anything other than the Christ, the Son of the living God! Thank you, Dan Brown, for making my faith stronger 
 Unless you have a perfectly flat yard with golf-course grade grass and absolutely no twigs, leaves, pinecones, moisture, or variations in ground level, this thing won't go.  On flat concrete it seems to do OK.  In the yard, however, we are forever PUSHING this thing around because it cannot go on it's own.  The wheels are constantly spinning out.  We bought it as a 3rd birthday gift for my son.  Obviously, he would like to ride it, but we hardly ever use it because my husband and I hate walking behind him and pushing!  We thought we had purchased a great thing after all the reviews.  We were wanting him to have fun and help us with yard work by hauling sticks/leaves/pinecones around.  How wrong we were.  It was fairly easy step-by-step assembly.  We have had no breakage or charging problems, but we don't use it very often because of the major traction problem.  It does seem to stay charged quite awhile even after long amounts of time in storage.  We bought this after a lot of research.  These people who think this thing is so great must have flat concrete yards.  I have never spent so much money and been so disappointed.   
 2 months after ordering, i have year to get my first issue.  i'm sure i'll like it...if i ever get it 
 Mark Gabriel tries to analyze the historical relations between Islam and Judaism, or Muslims and Jews, based on biblical teaching and the Quran itself, ignoring historical and political facts.  His own religious beliefs shaped the analysis in this book and added some misleading tips.  Among many of the conceptual mistakes are the following: - Gabriel underlines the "Fundamentalist Muslim Governments" in the Middle East, and says "they are governments based on Islamic teachings" without mentioning Saudi Arabia.  - He says the leaders of Lebanon are Muslims. In fact, the Lebanese president is Christian, and half of the cabinet members and Parliament are Christians. - He says that Hizbullah emerged after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In fact, Hizbullah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and started taking the shape we know today in 1985. These are some of the mistakes.  Gabriel also says that the Arab-Israeli conflict is based exclusively on the teachings of the Quran in regard of Jews. This is absurd. First, not all Arabs who fought Israel and are still against the establishment of Israel were Muslims. A good example would be the late totalitarian leader of Syria, Hafez Assad, an Alawite, which is a sect that does not follow the Quran. Another example would be the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is an extreme left secular group that was involved in most of heavyweight attacks against Israeli targets in last three decades, and whose founder, George Habash, is Christian. Additionally, Gabriel says the Quran is the only reason that made Palestinians and Arabd Muslims fight Israeli troops and kill Israeli innocent civilians. This is a fallacy. The Quran indeed orders Muslims to fight Jews, but it is nave to consider that it is the only reason behind the current conflict. Other reasons that Gabriel should have mentioned would be the Israeli occupation of large areas of the 1967 lands and the high level of illiteracy and unemployment among the Palestinians that leave little choice for Palestinian youth to chose a future that is not connected to fighting Israel.  The book is also full of overgeneralizations. Gabriel, who was born in a poor religious Muslim family and was forced to memorize the Quran and hate Jews when he was a kid, projects the same situation on all Arabs and Muslims. He also divides Muslims into different categories based on his own thoughts disregarding sociology, anthropology, culture and geography.  What is mostly shocking is that he argues that the Arab-Israeli conflict could not be settled through negotiations or wars, but "only through the blood of Jesus Christ." This is too far from reality! Still, the two interesting parts of the book are the part that deals with all the Quranic verses related to Jews and their Historical context, showing how they were affected by the daily ties between Mohamed and the Jewish community in Medina, and the part that shows how a Muslim fanatic can turn out to be a devoted Christian.    
 This is the most disappointing book I have read on the topic of discernment, and I have read dozens. The book's misleading subtitle is "Finding Answers to the Deepest Questions", yet the reader is given little if any indication of how to do so.  The author would most likely agree that we can't "find answers" in such a hard and fast way. Then why print this in the subtitle?  The vast majority of the book is spent listing what is "not", in the author's view, the appropriate way of discerning God's will. We are left with very little.  It is unfortunate that the book is packaged the way that it is. The dramatic title of the book seems to be marketing to pop culture, yet it isn't written with the layman in mind.  The author's own views on appropriate discernment techniques aren't mentioned until very late in the book, which confuses the reader throughout the duration. I wish he spent less time criticizing Parker Palmer, and more time stating his own beliefs.        I bought this book, in part, because I trusted Marcus Borg's recommendation. What a disappointment. Instead I would suggest "Inviting the Mystic, Supporting the Prophet" by Katherine Dyckman and L. Patrick Caroll, or "Urgings of the Heart" by Wilkie Au and Noreen Cannon.  Advanced readers might enjoy "Spiritual Direction - Beyond the Beginnings," by Janet K. Ruffing. While some of these books are intended for spiritual directors, many who are interested in discernment may also find them helpful.      
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 My subscription is expiring in a few days and this suite is impossible to renew.  They are trying to force you into 2006 security suite for the big bucks and buggy software.  2005 works fine until I have been thru the runaround 3 times with e-mail customer support.  I won't pay for their telephone customer support, trend micro will force me to buy another brand because of this.  Shame on you pcillin 
 GODIN wrote about the new way of customer and prospect communication in PERMISSION MARKETING -- a must read.  He then got bold and told us about differentiation by creating something completely out-of-the-ordinary such as a PURPLE COW -- agreeable airplane literature.  Now there's really nothing else to talk about and he tries to push the envelope talking about how Cracker Jack's prize is the product.    Your product's soul is not only about the extras.  I would have preferred he kept to his excellent job in PERMISSION MARKETING and not losing his focus as he did in FREE PRIZE INSIDE.    I am not going to read a 4th GODIN book 
 I'm amazed that the US still has to put up with this half baked rush release, If you want the fully realised package with English sound track from the usual cast then get the region two version ISBN B000BY9ALU. OK so it'll probably cost you twice as much and you'll need a multi region player. But for something this good why put up with second best. This is one of those films where the brain really needs to be turned on, as treating it like a popcorn movie will leave you dazed and confused. It continues the theme from GITS 1 querying the boundaries between man and machine and the dangers of ghost hacking. At times it gets a touch pretentious with Batou and Togusa swapping obscure quotations, but it is both beautiful and thought provoking.  Again a split review 5 for the film, 2 for the slipshod DVD release 
 As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel.  I give it 3 stars for holding my attention.  A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past.  The one star is a mistake and I cannot seem to change it.   3 ***  stars 
 Let me be frank; this book is garbage.  I am one of those people that laughs at everything, including things you shouldn't laugh at, like people falling down stairs, religion, etc.  This book, however, I did NOT laugh at.. At all.  I don't see how so many people thought that this was funny.  I understand that each person is entitled to his or her own opinions.  So here I'm giving mine.  Do not waste your time or money on a book that looks like it was printed for 5 year olds.  Reading it might actually make you dumber 
 This densely written book gives the patient reader a few of the same insights that one can get from a good Chumash (Torah w/commentary) such as the Artscroll Chumash or the Conservatives' Etz Chaim-- so I would not say it is completely worthless.  The difference is that a Chumash is pithier and more clearly written than this book.  When I read the Torah portion every week, I sometimes can't put it down (especially in Genesis).  By contrast, I found it impossible to keep plowing through this learned but dull, dull, dull tome 
 It's not often that I want the heroine killed off before I am half way through the book but Josie was disgusting and truly in need of psychiatric help.  By the end of the book I was wondering about Cooper's mental health.  No sane person would have put up with her antics.  I love Ms Brockman's writing but this book was difficult to finish.  There was no one to root for except the kids and you had to wonder what would become of them living in that dysfunctional household.  
 I don't like to give a book one star. This is probably a childish thing of mine, something about not liking to be "be mean". I believe that everyone's theories and ideas should be valued and considered, and I don't want to attack anyone's beliefs. Obviously a great deal of work went into researching this book, and it is very well produced.  But on the other hand, to be truthful, I couldn't help but feel anger while reading this book. Because the authors, on very subtle levels proceed to attack many other people's way of life. There is a lot of underlying judgement here. And that bothers me. Psychology doesn't have to be that way, but often it is. Hearing their attacks, I can't help but want to attack the flaws in their beliefs. It's just human.  Throughout this book, the authors claim that families without fathers are at a loss (the chapter "where's poppa?"), they attack parents who chose to to routine feed their children, instead of demand-breast feed. They claim that not smiling enough at a child will cause them to feel rejected.  There is a tremendous amount of pressure on new parents to perform well. Give them a break please. A lot of this leads to them feeling depressed and distressed. This books heaps more pressure and judgements on people who should be supported, not condemned. New parents try hard, but nothing short of martyring oneself for their children would be good enough for this book. Sleeping with your newborn baby in your bed? What about your relationship? What if your partner works? They can't just be woken up all night when they have to get up early, its just not fair... And what about society? Doesn't society get any blame for violent children? I know this book mentions video games, but I'm not talking about that. Society has a much bigger part to play in the creation of its members than just video games.  Where I come from, this book and similar others are being used to segregate and judge certain groups of society. Socials workers are removing newborn babies of depressed mothers because they claim it will permantly damage the children. Parents are being threatened that if they don't take anti-depressants they will be seen as comprimising the health of their children. Young mums are being condemned. This book may have never been intended to be used as such a weapon, but the truth is, would the authors condone such behaviour? I think they would, because they really believe that they are right. As I've said, there is nothing wrong with that belief (everyone to their own), but this book is overstepping the boundaries. It doesn't leave everyone else's beliefs alone. A lot of children who grow up in abusive homes turn out to be fine and caring individuals, but this book points the finger at them and says they are "irreversibly damaged". The authors have no right to claim that.   Some of my best friends are single mums. Some of them bottle fed. And some of them had to place their children in daycare a lot because they worked. Books like these would only serve to compound the guilt these mothers already feel, the guilt that society tries to lump on them already. I think they are doing a brilliant job with their children, but people always feel the need to judge.  In this book, T Berry-Brazelton (some similar name) is quoted as saying that we should not let our babies cry because that's how the cave-people raised their children and we are no different physically to how we were back then. That we still have the same needs, we just live in a different era. But, the cave-people also  killed each other during fights, when they were angry. Does the authors also advocate that? You can't just pick out the romantic stuff from the past and wave that in our faces while ignoring the rest. Well, I think so, at least.  I may only be 20 years old, but I have children of my own, and to me, this book was the last thing that should have been given to me when I had my first child. It set unattainable goals that were much more of a stress than a help. All of us are only human, let's stop the "judgment war" on who's responsible for sociey's violence, shall we? I hope one day we can.   I was always a person who chose my own path though, so I disregarded this book, but I've seen too many other friends who are scared to tell others that they let their children cry for fear of being judged. They are afraid to tell the truth of their experiances to their health workers becuase they know the finger will be pointed at them. They have to lie to their doctors that they are not feeling miserable because they don't want to be considered bad parents. I can't deny how sad this makes me, and how much I wish that others would concertrate on their own familes and lay off others. There is no easy solution to child violence, but we wont find the answer condemning others.  There has to be a better way than this book, because the theories in this book hurt too many people. And that's never a good thing in my humble opinion 
 Pages 1003 thru 1050 were missing in my copy. Pages 1051 thru 1098 were repeted.  Check your copy carefully. The book would have been more helpful if all the pages indicated in the index existed.  
 I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is 
 well, where to begin...not the most inspirational album ever, a bit of a let down from the first i thought seeing as the film was soooo "GOOD". some good tracks like lo fidelity all stars and the fiddle one errrr.....ok then. so in conclusion..ladies and gentlemen scotty DONT ! :- 
 i didn't think anything could be more of a waste of money than "nogatco rd.", but i was wrong. this sucks. wack beats, boy-band casio melodies, and it's short, which is actually a good thing.  get project polaroid if you want anything in the same vein as the stuff  keith did with kutmasta kurt, which is really the only good stuff he's done.  
 I read The Alchemist a few months ago and posted a glowing review of it on Amazon. I don't know what I was thinking. I must have been temporarily insane or something because looking back on it, I can't believe I fell for such a hollow load of rubbish. There were no real revelations to it at all. It's just a childish story with delusions of grandeur.  The idea that we are all looked after by the universe, if only we let ourselves go is a joke. Don't get me wrong, I know it sounds like a great idea, but let's face it, life's a lot more complicated than that.  Basically, The Alchemist and Veronika Decides to Die has about as much wisdom as you'd find in a fortune cookie. It's all just stuff to make you feel better about yourself even if your life is rubbish. What it comes down to is the idea that everything's fine as long as you're happy. So as far as my ex-girlfriend was concerned, she was happier spending time with some actor she met at her book group than she was with me, and that justifies her dumping me. I saw him as well. He was the usual type of scruffy look-at-me-I'm-so-dark-and-deep loser women always seem to want, even though they always say they want a nice guy in all those polls I read in their magazines. But hey, as long as she's living for the moment, and seizing life, then it's all fine and she can't possibly be wrong, can she? And she had the nerve to suggest in the letter she wrote to me that I should read Veronika Decides to Die and embrace my destiny. And she won't answer any of my calls because "now we need space to find ourselves", in other words, because she doesn't want to. She probably doesn't even know what she's done. And she definitely doesn't care. These books and this philosophy is so selfish and blinkered. Most people give up all this stuff when they leave university. Grow up and try living in the real world for once. This philosophy's only about looking after yourself at the expense of others.  I really think these books are dangerous. They fool people into thinking they're making the world a better place when really they're just acting like children. I feel really sorry for people who have bought into this. I just resent falling for it, and I'm angry at myself for having believed in it at the time. It makes me feel used, if you want the truth. I really feel like warning as many people so they don't make the same mistake that I did.  At least I can see it for what it is now. A complete waste of time. I just want my time back. I want it all back. Every last minute, every book I read, every film I saw, everything. But life's not like that. And it'll never be like this book either 
 It's Christmas Day, and believe me, the only thing that would get me to sit down at a computer is the level of dissatisfaction I've had with the Thomas battery powered engines.  These trains derail constantly.  I think it is because all four wheels have power, and the front wheels have too much traction, so they are able to climb out of the grooves.  Took me all night to set up a really cool track, and they derail every 40 seconds or so.  Read: 3 year old yelling at train.  Thank goodness I also bought a Brio battery powered engine as well (the Polar Express one).  It works much better.  It has not derailed once all morning.  It also is better in the following ways: 1) It shuts off after 2 minutes so you don't lose battery power, 2) it can go into freewheel mode when you want to use it without power, 3) it goes in reverse, 4) it makes train sounds, 5) the coupling to other cars has a swivel which means it is less likely to derail and more likely to maintain the magnetic connection, 6) it comes with batteries installed.  If "Santa Claus" had not disposed of all the packaging last night, I would return all the battery operated Thomas Trains and go with Brio ones.  Note: there is a good thomas battery powered car which is the jet engine.  This jet engine has the swivel, and seems not to derail, maybe because it pushes the other cars in front of it 
 Our Classic Tin Kaleidoscope arrived with a huge dent in it not in a separate box but thrown in with another item we ordered, and the return policy would not include shipping the item back, the cost for shipping would be more then the Kaleidoscope itself, so we kept the dented version, it works fine, but the dented casing is not a good sell....would recommend to make sure this gets shipped with a trustworthy company that knows how to wrap an item 
 Bwowsing thru this book, one can only think the author has either (1) been sleeping, or (2) hiding under a rock for the past 5 years or so! As far as the wonderful "Bring em On" ,"Mission Accomplished" "Achievements" regarding the Iraq catastrophe, this author should go over there himself unescorted, and go between the Green Zone and Airport, the world's most dangerous area! So you lie about your dad's enemy, slaughter thousands of innocents, each dying his/her own horrible death, sponsored by Bush & Co..This is success!.Anyone with even a 9th grade education knows that revenge will explode its ugly head, as it has in Iraq, and here after 9/11/01, an event which some people still think was Saddam's doing, thanks to the continual lies of Bush % Co..And Katrina, a total disaster showing this GOP administration true incompetent and ignorant colors. Hey, so a great US city drowned while our amphibious craft, and many Louisiana Guardsman, were both in Iraq, helpless to defend a drowning city. As GWB said ,"No one thought the levies would break!". Truly the ugliness of Bush and his fellow reactionaries is astounding. And they harp on "hating"Bush!!..Well, what were these same reactionaries doing during the Clinton years?! Just unleashing the nastiest personal hate and character assassination campaign in the nation's history!! This is their idea of a "Great Leader?" Also, I don't think angering millions around the world makes for a great leader either. Hiding behind the flag and your deity in the sky may have lots of appeal for the ever-growing lunatic fringe in the reactionary right, but , thankfully, the US citizenry is finally wising up to these lying, incompetent, ignorant, cronying war mongers, and possible war criminals! Thankfully, it is never too late! 
 I'm sorry, but some of the samples in this book just scare me. The two zombie children have shown up in my nightmares even.  I suppose that some of the techniques will take me in the direction I want to go, but I'm praying that I will have better results than the author.  If you are looking for those amazing money making techniques that highend studios are using today, look elsewhere.  This is not the book for you and me 
 Yikes - who edited this thing?  While there are a few gems, I felt like I was reading a book with half the pages missing.  Clearly, material is taken from his other books and recycled for this one, but he might have checked to make sure that all the referenced graphs and text were actually in the book!  Numerous times I was flipping around to try to find a chart he was talking about, only to find that it wasn't anywhere in the book.  You get the impression quickly that this was churned out to scrape in some extra dough.  Larry's writing style is "conversational" - and that's a charitable way to describe it.  Despite all these flaws, there is some good info, and some good trading ideas, but I can't recommend it 
 I usually like Tami Hoag's books, she is a story teller with a surprising twist. The twist was there this time also. However,the characters were way too predictable. They all seemed on the dark side, even the "heroes." Surely there has got to be a non-divorced person in this world. Not in her book. Well, unless you are the guy who kills people because they're in the way. Then you can be single and never married.  The bad guys had no redemptive features -- too cartoon-like.   And the unnecessarily bad language was a turn-off. Surely even in cop land not every one uses the f... word in every sentence.  The plot was somewhat interesting but felt undeveloped, kind of like the characters.  Of course tastes differ. I like a bit more psychological depth with my murders than Tami Hoag offers in this story. Maybe next time 
 I was raised to believe that if you can't say something nice about someone you shouldn't say anything at all, so whenever I deliver up a negative review on someone's work, I feel slightly guilty. That admitted, well, basically I'll only offer this: I did not care for Ms. Angelou's poetry very much. However, were I to continue on with this review, I might also add that I failed to discern her talent or feel much of a personal tie to her cultural awareness or her message. I might even conclude (were I not stopping at what I wrote up above) by confessing that even the range of her vocabulary (or should I say the lack of a range)  failed to impress me. I don't think Maya Angelou deserves the high praise she gets on an almost universal level and have my own opinion as to why she receives so much of it.   Just my view.. 
 This book contains 100 pages if you count blank pages (really 50) of 12 different patterns repeated 4 times on low grade paper.  As tiling patterns go these are somewhere well short of ultimate 
 This book is very sad since this strange little man doesn't know much astral travelling.He tells that the astral world is made up of your thoughts and fantasies and the higher realms are made up of humans elavated  thoughts about heaven.Thus,implicated the thought in your head that your  astral travels are ILLUSORY.In fact they are of seperate creation and is an  insult to fearies/nature spirits/angels/God by saying they are not  real.This book is bad.This goldberg man reduces the spiritual art to  nothing but a form of childrens dream.This book won't help you to leave  your body either,it has methods that he expects you to simply master.Also  he does not tell how to find you guides or friends but tells you instead  when you do find them.I would have refund this book if I didn't leave in my  salon floor for a month 
 The book was supposed to be a translation, but the author has ended up publishing her biases in the garb of presenting it in narrative form. A quick search on the author reveals that she is a controversial character and that Encarta removed her contribution after investigating her scholarship.   As someone interested in learning about Hinduism, I was looking for someone who could just give me the facts instead of a polemicist. The book was a huge disappointment. I wish I had known about Encarta yanking her piece on the grounds of poor scholarship before I embarked on reading her "translation. 
 I have horrible bags and deep creases along edge of preorbital area. Of all the products I have tried, Olay Regenerist eye cream works the best. Also my plastic surgeon said that part of the dark purple is my muscle showing thru because I have excess skin but no fat in periorbital area. He said he will inject fat from my rear(plenty) and that will lessen the color, and after he removes excess skin, he will use laser 
 And I am still awaiting all of the things Cumbey warns us about in this book to come to pass....  I had originally read the first edition of this book shortly after it was released, by advice of my then Baptist pastor.  I was getting hit up by him to read anti-New Age books, as well as from a "secular" friend to follow up on researching things closely related to The Aquarian Conspiracy.  I was also a fledgling 20-something Christian with a head full of ideas on how to save humanity and also heavily into the apocalypitcal scriptures.  To say the least I was young, dumb and full of heady ideas and general anger toward humanity, and I used my faith to buttress that belief.  I can safely say that I feel that I have grown IMMENSELY in my "faith" since then and have a definite Gnostic bent toward my belief in God.  I have basically shunned the Christian dogma and ethos in favor of a more personal view.  "Religion" is something that I refuse to practice.  This book and others like it are definitely kindling for my resistance to the Christian Apocalyptical anti-New Age movement inherent in many religious groups.  Speculative, ill-researched, and almost tabloid-ish, this book can be used as a meter for the brand of Christian paranoiac visions of "The End Times" which can turn a nice person who just wanted to go to church into a zealot.  It also uses the age-old problematic angle of the argumentative fallacies of "Appeal to Authority, Appeal to Belief, Appeal to Consequences of a Belief, Appeal to Fear, Appeal to Tradition, Misleading Vividness, and using a Biased Sample" which are found in many publications of this type.  Any argument that has all of these fallacies stacked against it is pretty unstable.  Cumbey makes all of these errors and more in this book and ignores evidential reasoning in favor of grand speculation.  To be frank, Constance Cumbey comes off as simply paranoid in this book and seems to wish to draw the reader into her world of highly charged conspiracy theories.  Being a practicing psychologist and a teacher of organizational behavior and leadership, I always warn my students that paranoia is self-perpetuating.  All things which look to be born of paranoia should be first scrutinized and tested logically and with good reasoning and also placed under a microscope before any decisions are made regarding its validity, and therefore pursuit.  As I mentioned previously, this book has inherent instabilities which lead one to not believe in the claims written within the pages.  Now, after trashing it, why did I give it 2 stars and not 1?  Well, it is basically because it does have some value.  Tsun Zu said "Know the terrain/know you're adversary."  This is a good way to get a balanced view of the subject of "New Age" watching.  The book does contain several references to claims, things, people, events and the like which can be used as ballast for the facts that actually stand up to scrutiny and reason.  And once again, we are all still waiting for all of these speculations to come to pass, Ms. Cumbey.  People have been predicting "The End Times" to be just around the corner ever since St. Peter walked the earth.  We still wait... 
 I love many of this author's books, especially Fairy Godmother, and the concept of Tradition. However, in this book she seems to use the Tradition as a crutch. The story is entirely predictable and formulaic, which most readers would find annoying, at the very least, in any other novel, but it seems that because she acknowledges that weakness, it's okay. The book is well written, but essentially boring. I felt very disappointed by this novel. If you really want to know what it's about, read the inside cover. That's pretty much all you need to know about this book 
 Seriously, I am an expert, and this movie sucks. But, imagine for a moment--yes, stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices--a movie whose premise is truly profound, strikingly engaging, and culturally challenging--that art is only such relative to those individuals, those `experts', whose tastes, likes and dislikes, decide it so. Given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical--a matter of pure subjective opinion--why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all? Besides this interesting question, which is put forth explicitly, without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry, and in about 60 seconds, the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration. Avoid at all costs. 
 The shortcomings of Doniger's general Indological scholarship have been detailed by Michael Witzel and Rajiv Malhotra. This book suffers from the same flaws. The translations are idiosyncratic, and she is obsessed with finding sex, even in situations that none is called for 
 I didn't find that there was enough basic information in this book to be useful to me.  I think the author is trying to make money off of the "concept" rather than provide lots of informative information.  And I admit, I was lured into the "concept" and bought the book, with much disapointment.    For me the 1001 Do It Yourself hints & tips by reader's digest is more comprehensive with 100x more information than this book.  In addition, the reader's digest books is geared towards ANYONE, because this is information that everyone needs for their first home, not just "women".  In the reader's digest book you learn about plumbing basics, how to deal with kitchen fires, leaks and everything inbetween.  (You can preview the book on Amazon too!)  
 Atrocious Compilation - it's of some of the worst films the Coens' did (excluding The Big Lebowksi) and does not include their most famous films.  What were they thinking?  It's like if they released a Spielberg Compilation but only included Catch Me If You Can, AI, Minority Report, and War of the Worlds.  WTF!!!!  Plus you can buy each DVD separately and come UNDER the asking price of the entire set.  The BIg Lebowski and The Man Who Wasn't There are about 10 bucks new in most stores.  Blood Simple and Int. Cruelty (which is the most UNCoen film ever) are closer to 5 in many places I've seen.  So don't fall into the "compilation trap" because you are not getting a "bulk" discount.  Just buy the films you want separately.  Most Coen DVDs are very reasonable price wise.    Any Coen compilation without Fargo, Barton Fink, and Raising Arizona is worthless.   And again, you're better off spending $40 on those DVDs individually.  
 Bought the 3pack for home use.  Installed it on two pc's and then had defective a defective new pc that it was installed on and removed.  NOW, it won't let me activate on the new computer - their system is flawed!!!!  They want me to mail in original invoice, unlock code and disk and THEN they'll see what they want to do.  This will all take at least 2 to 3 weeks, in the meantime there is no protection on this computer.  HAAAAA!  They really need to have a specific code for each activation so that it updates to the active computer it is being used on - they really could figure this out.  They're taking the easy way out and getting more $$$ in the process.  This combined with all other slow down issues, I'm switching to ZONE Suite, as I've used Zone Alarm for years and it is great.  Best of luck 
 Not as expected. Does not give off enough lite to read cook books. Appears to be strictly decorative 
 James is a great literary virtuoso, in certain ways the most sophisticated and complex America has had. His intricate intelligence is complemented by an unequaled descriptive power, and a mastery of language, second to none. How difficult then to come across the passage which ruins this book for me. This is James description of the immigrant Jews on the East Side.It is the observation of the sterile aristrocatic owner of Anglo-Saxon civilization who looks with contempt and horror at the poor swarming sweatshop crowd threatening to steal his private inheritance from him.  
 I'm a huge Black Sabbath fan.  I hear nothing in Black Mountain that even remotely resembles BS.  This CD really sucks if you are a hard rock fan.  It is soft, folksy, crap.  To me it sounds like the Mammas and the Pappas meet the Partidge Family 
 I found this woman to be a bit crazy.  One minute she's saying that you should never ever criticize someone's writing, next minute she's telling us which sample of writing is better than the other and which we should emulate.  She actually says that her students' writing was better than someone who's already been published, which was alright at first but after about 10 different examples of her bashing the published writer, I found her to be quite pompous. All writing is subjective, and I don't see what gives her the right to tell us which writing is BETTER than another, based on HER point of view.  I felt like I was being yanked around by a leash.  She also says we should just sit around being lazy and idle, and that it's a good thing.  I'm sorry, I just don't see it her way.  It's like a recipe for disaster.  Anyway, that's just my take on it.  Take from it what you will 
 never before has a movie had such an apt title as this mess. the plot is as thin as the main person in the movie gets. just really a waste of time and money for me,i thought! skip this mess!! 
 I'll admit it. The first three or so Cheetos actually taste pretty good. However, each one seems to taste worse, for some reason. And then there's the despicable Cheeto dust... You get that stuff on your fingers, and you're forced to either wipe it on something, (gross) or thoroughly lick it off your fingers (gross). I detest snacks with sticky dust crap. This stuff is the worst offender 
 While the premise of this book is intriguing the delivery was disappointing at best. The analogies between golf and business were  trite and not very illustrative.  Good analogies between golf and business process analysis do exist, such as the way that statistical analysis and feedback loops are used by pros to reduce variation in shot accuracy and eliminate wasted motion in their swings. "Shots into bunkers represent waste" is about as sophisticated as this book gets.    
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 The conservative mindset seems to be that 'liberals' are as monolithic in their views as conservatives and unlike conservatives who are honest and good are a pack of rotten liars.  If you can buy into that basic notion, you might enjoy the book.  Otherwise, watching the author knock down straw men could be a little dull. One thing to keep in mind while reading this book is that the core of conservative belief is an irrational personality cult.  I recall during the 2000 election telling liberals why I did not like Gore.  They would respond, "Yes, but..."  If I tried the same thing with conservatives about Bush or Cheney, they would shriek at me, some refusing to speak with me again.   It has become a major concern now for conservatives to cloak their views in the costume of rationality.  This author hopes to cash in on this trend.  I am sure the book will be successful.  Obviously, it presupposes that conservatives are right on everything.  Even when they are clearly wrong, their choices are supposedly so well thought out that anyone who disagrees with them is a liar or a fool.  I suppose this is like Holland's tulip mania.  Eventually it will burn itself out but it will never quite go away 
 The instinct to cash in on their well-earned reputation as a landmark band of the nineties was perhaps too much for the surviving members of Sublime to resist, hence this release.  Most of tracks presented here are sub-par versions of previously released material. It would be of interest to hardcore fans and others who are curious as to the evolution of their songs, but there is little else here to sustain interest over any period of time. 
 But if you have seen full metal jacket, if you have seen apocalypse now, if you have seen any vietnam movie (year of the pig, hearts and minds...) there is no reason to buy this book. It's done in the kerouac style of the 60s, which impresses no one these days. It's a smallminded personal narrative (fiction) 
 The main thing about this book is that it could have used a better editor than it got.  There are run-on sentences.  Sentences are repeated.  Paragraphs are repeated or reiterate information already given.  There are grammatical errors that made me ashamed for Anne Rice. Basically it reads as though there was a deadline and the manuscript had to be rushed to the presses as it was, without someone to read it and make sound-minded decisions on how it should read as a serious work of fiction.  The Witching Hour is formulaic.  The author basically rushes through the generational histories of the Mayfair witches in a race to get to the last and present matriach sorceress, Rowan Mayfair.  This is a pity because Rowan Mayfair is hardly more than her name--she is that flat of a character.  Her witch-ancestresses were much more interesting and Rice does have a gift for writing historical periods with deft and charming detail.  Several good books could easily have come from the ancestral storylines.  Although it purports to be science fiction, The Witching Hour is actually a gothic romance, which is basically pornographic fiction for women.  For this reason, there is an unusual amount of sex in this book.  Science fiction readers may be uncomfortable with this element since it is not the norm for the sci-fi genre to be this steamy and besotted.  Also curious for a book that has New Orleans for a setting is the complete absence of African-American characters.  The city of New Orleans is a famous home of the Voodoo religion which has African roots.  Voodoo itself was popularized by an African-American Voodoo priestess by the name of Marie Laveau, a New Orleans native and resident.  Curiously, Rice makes no mention of this vital history even as she uses the city's mystical and magical glamour as a backdrop for her story.  I think this is because Rice cannot write about poor people.  Invariably, her characters are rich and powerful.  They have power beyond ordinary power--they are witches, and they live lives of instant wish-fulfillment in which they can immediately have whatever they want.  Character development does not seem to be very important to Rice.  At least not in this book.  This novel could have used some good revisions.  I would like to see some of the storylines developed into fuller, book-length stories.  If you are frustrated by badly written books, then skip The Witching Hour.  I recommend you read The Book of Spirits by James Reese, or Voodoo Dreams, by Jewel Parker Rhodes 
 Another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation... If you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...Unfortunately they don't come with disclaimers. like one would get when reading a book on the occult... People tend to go for books that support their bigoted view, and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it.... It is a living. When the Da Vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot's guide to the code, how to interpret the code etc etc.... I am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the NY times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad... 
 a coffee table book come to life, ridiculously uninvolving writing and acting; you could turn to any chapter in this pretentious take on mid-20th century japan and not suffer any the worse for it. 
 Juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career.  He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s.  But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer.  Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there.  B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy.  Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars.  Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great.  Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check.  "Get Your Hustle On" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead.  "I Know You Know" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio.  "Around The Way" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either.  "Sets Go Up" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single "Rodeo" is the millennium version of "Back That [...] Up" only with a more subdued approach.  Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there.  "What's Happenin'" is nothing to write home about, "Loose Booty" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and "Break A Brick Down" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. "Who's Ya Daddy" is pointless, along with the annoying "Keep Talkin'" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and "Why Not."  Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on "Rock Like That."  The biggest shocker has to be "Addicted" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of "The Rain.")    There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning.  This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory.  With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album.  One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come.  
 This is more a text book with a general approach. The focus is not on Lean.  The formulas in the book are given with very little explanation; I would hate to be in a class where this book is used as the basis for instruction. I hoped to find a lot of detailed information about Lean production systems but the book has too much other topics to be valuable as an aid to design and/or implement Lean production systems. The title is misleading and the practioner looking for either theoretical or practical information about Lean production systems will be dissapointed in what he finds in the book 
 "My edition of Demanding the Impossible was published in 1992 by HarperCollins Publishers. On p.561, Marshall writes that:    David Friedman sees such agencies as both brokers of mini- social contracts and producers of 'laws' which conform to the market demand for rules to regulate commerce. Each person would be free to subscribe to a protective association of his choice, since 'Protection from coercion is an economic good.' Apart from adumbrating The Machinery of Freedom (1973), Friedman has popularized Hayek's defense of capitalism as the best antidote to the serfdom of collectivism in books with such self-explanatory titles as Capitalism and Freedom (1962) and Free to Choose (1979).  The true author of Capitalism and Freedom and Free to Choose is of course Milton Friedman, David Friedman's non-anarchist father. Milton Friedman is not mentioned in the two preceding pages of the chapter; and in any case "Friedman" clearly is meant to refer to David Friedman. (Nor is Milton Friedman in the index or bibliography of the book, although at least Milton Friedman's books are omitted from the bibliography rather than attributed to David Friedman's authorship a second time.)   This error is so egregious that the reader can only conclude that Peter Marshall presumes to write about books that he has never even seen the cover of, much less read. Whether Marshall corrected it in a subsequent edition, or whether the error was simply corrected by the transcriber of the widely available Internet exerpt , I do not know. But even if the correction was Marshall's, for this kind of error to have made it into a published book speaks volumes.   On the same page, Marshall writes that:   The writings of Ayn Rand, a refugee from the Soviet Union, best represent the intellectual background to the new right-wing libertarianism in the United States. In her The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism (1964), she attempted a philosophical defence of egoism while in her novels she portrayed a superior individual fighting the forces of collectivism, particularly in the form of the State. Her superior individual, driven by a Nietzschean will to power, appears in the guise of a capitalist entrepreneur who is presented as the source of all wealth and the creator of all progress. Rand claimed that she had a direct knowledge of objective reality, and her 'Objectivist' movement had a considerable vogue in the sixties. Like most anarcho-capitalists, she is convinced of the truth of her own views, which to others appear mere dogma.  And in my edition, the paragraph immediately ends. The next paragraph begins, "Amongst anarcho-capitalist apologists, the economist Murray Rothbard is probably the most aware of the anarchist tradition."   Again, this outrageous error has been corrected in the Internet excerpt of Demanding the Impossible. But it provides additional proof that Peter Marshall presumes to write about books and authors that he has never read. Ayn Rand's attack on anarcho-capitalism (in "The Nature of Government," one essay in her The Virtue of Selfishness) is so clear that Marshall could only make this error by failing to have even read the author whose views he is describing.   These are only two of Marshall's numerous factual errors which demonstrate a shocking lack of basic standards of scholarship. After all, a book is not a Usenet posting; one is supposed to spend months or years in study, fact-checking, re-writing, and so on.   Some similar errors appear in Ulrike Heider's Anarchism: Left, Right and Green. Once again, there are errors so gross that the only possible explanation is that Heider presumes to write about books she has never read.   A few examples of her poor scholarship:    "Menger is considered the founder of the Austrian School of Economics, which continued to refine its theory of monetary value until the middle of the 20th century. The most prominent descendent of this school of thought is is monetarist Milton Friedman, the economic authority for such politicians as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and others." Anarchism: Left, Right, and Green, p.100.  Milton Friedman is not and never has had any affiliation with the Austrian School. In fact, he is the most famous member of the rival Chicago School, which even a minimal study of the differences between free-market economists would have revealed.   "If it weren't for their obsession with work and their misanthropic outlook, one might mistake Rand's heroes for left-wing bohemians. They are always Anglo-Saxon Americans." ibid, p.105  Francisco d'Anconia, one of the four major heroic characters in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is of South American nationality.   "Roark's rival, the mediocre architect Peter Keaton..."ibid  The character's name is in fact Peter Keating. While the error is trivial, it does indicate that Heider sees no need to get the basic facts straight when she discusses a book. The Fountainhead is divided into four sections, each named for one major character; "Peter Keating" is the title of the first section. It would be very hard to miss, unless you never read the book (or wrote from memory years afterwards).   Reversing her previous confusion about the Austrian vs. the Chicago schools of economics, Heider appears to attribute monetarist policy prescriptions to Rothbard: "The monetarist road out of such misery must lead through a depression, the 'painful but necessary process by which the free market rids itself of the excesses and errors of the boom.' [quotation Rothbard's] Rothbard recommends that the government do the exact opposite of what the Keynesians suggest: it should simply abandon its policy of inflation by giving the free market reign and by reinstating the gold standard." ibid, p.131.  Again, Rothbard spent the better part of his academic career attacking monetarism and the Chicago school of economics with which monetarism is associated.  I have been informed by admirers of Murray Bookchin that Heider's work contains similar gross errors about eco-anarchism. Since this is not my field of expertise, I do not presume to point them out, but it would not surprise me.   It is one thing to violently disagree with an author, and to express one's disagreement in a book. It is another matter entirely to get basic facts wrong; so wrong, in fact, that it casts doubt on whether the author read the books he or she presumes to write about. "  
 I saw the "Young" part.  I even saw the "Black" part.  But "Gifted"?  My God!  This was such a waste of time in my busy life.  I can't believe I was subjected to read such boring nonsense.  If you're thinking of reading this book, DO NOT.  You would have more fun  being dead 
 I hate this magazine.  I subscribed sight-unseen based on the good reviews, and find the recipes are for food that no one in my house would ever eat...way too exotic.  If you like good ol' American fare, don't buy this one 
 I don't even know what to say about this book other than anyone who pretends to like this nonsense deserves to read it. Truman Capote's quote about Kerouac's writing, "That it's not writing, it's typing," probably sums up the matter better than anything I can say.  What disappoints me I suppose is that I really want to like Kerouac - I love the idea of him, though I can't say I care much for his typing. 
 I was disappointed in this book; it seemed to quote from nearly every earlier article on, or interview with, Trent/NIN.  There were a few tidbits I'd not run across before (but I was unimpressed with those - memories from high school acquaintences, etc.).  However, it may be informative to those who haven't been keeping up w/NIN since the early days, and it does attempt to place all the earlier info into a framework.  I just felt that too much of the book was derived from others' work (e.g., ROLLING STONE, SPIN), and that it could've used a bit more original material 
 Bought this for son when he turned 1 year. He was able able to push the button by 1.5 but the steering does not work. We have taken it apart and put it back together thinking that may be the problem and even put oil on the moving parts. It just doesn't seem to turn well. The mechanism for the steering is flimsy at best -a rod with a hook on the end and its quite frustrating for our little boy.  It also gets stuck easy in grass which is frustrating for all.  I would just wait till they can drive a bigger version. We are looking at purchasing a 12V vehicle now at age 2 
 You're money is better spent on another product.  It's made out of plastic so it feels cheaply made.  A nice thing about the product is that the fans are incredibly quiet, damn near silent, if it isn't damaged.  I had one fan made a scraping noise.    The fans are designed to draw the heat from the laptop, but I've found that these coolers are less effective than the laptop coolers that blow cool air in.  
 Wilkinson used a simple but effective teaching aid - 3 chairs which are used to represent 3 portraits or spiritual states in which everyone in the world can be divided into as illustrated in the diagram below:  CHAIR ONE - commitment, saved, spiritual	       CHAIR TWO - compromise, saved, carnal 	                 CHAIR THREE - conflict, unsaved, natural  His thesis that by identifying which chair we are sitting on at present, we can make a `spiritual breakthoughs' by making a decision to move from one chair to another.   Firstly, in an effort to make the concept relevant, Wilkinson have oversimplified the process of spiritual growth without reference to grace, spiritual formation, character development and development of new worldview. He seems to give the impression that spiritual breakthroughs is easy and achievable by human effort alone.  Secondly, there is weak theological support for his thesis except using Paul's terms (spiritual, carnal and natural man). In his Biblical example, he used Joshua, elders and children of elders. While he made his point of generational slide, the children of elders were disobedient rather than non believers. But it is true that there is a generational slide if each generation do not develop personal faith in Jesus.  Thirdly, Wilkinson meant the three chairs for Christians, backslidden Christians and non-Christian but there is no reference to the work of Jesus Christ on the cross and of the Holy Spirit in spiritual transformation. Wilkinson seems to imply that spiritual growth can take place by decision making alone.  There cannot be movements between the chairs without adequate appropriation of the theology of the cross and inner transformation without the work of the Holy Spirit especially in his examples of Julia, Ernie and Kate.  Finally, while marriage and parenting is important, one wonders whether the three-chairs model is the right approach. Section 3 & 4 sounds like promotions for Walk-Thru-the Bible Ministries programs. Wilkinson's book promises spiritual breakthroughs but one wonders whether it can delivers except for a short time haze of spiritual high.  
 joey pigza lit review        My lit circle book right now is not exciting because i don't like books but it doesn't make it a bad book to every one its just my opinion  but i would still recommend this to anyone who likes reading . Also this book would be a good book for anyone who might have a.d.d Cause joey also has a.d.d so for anyone this would be a book to read to relate to it. I  Would give this book a 0 if i could rate it cause it is kinda slow. . . . REALLY SLOW IN MY OPINION. This is a book for people who can sit still and read through a book.  wil 
 In my opinion, none of the episodes captured the best of the Pink Panther series.   
 this book got in my way when i was writing a reaserch paper. its little facts and no real good action story. an son of a beesting     F! 
   This book was written by W. Scott Morton and J. Kenneth Olenik. I never want to purchase anything from these authors again. The material in the book contains very incorrect and slanderous information, as well as a failure to provide relevant information, concerning Nichiren Daishonin and Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism. I know this for a fact because I am a member of the Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism, which is True Mahayana Buddhism, with the Head Temple based in Japan. I have been to the Head Temple twice before, and to the temples in the United States, several times since joining in 1984. The Nichiren Shoshu is NOT political, as the authors present in their book.  And Nichiren Daishonin was not political, either, as the authors present. Nor do the authors present the material in a responsible and informative manner, which would be the only suitable manner, especially for persons of their standing in the educational field. To understand the times and the culture of the country at the time, and the circumstances that Nichiren Daishonin was contending with, and to obtain CORRECT information on the actual beliefs and practice, the only reliable source would be the Nichiren Shoshu temples themselves.      Considering the interwoven relationships of religion and politics, and their supportive or non-supportive roles in research, science, medical, etc., fields and their overrall effect on influencing societal behaviors, this is an extremely serious error of the authors.    Not only am I so very dissatisfied with the information they presented, I am also very dissatisfied with their presentation of it.  Based on this, I cannot trust their other information either, especially in reference to comments concerning the corruption of U.S. contractors, and the Japanese government, and similiar topics. Even if the information presented on those topics were correct, my question then becomes "Who is the corruptive force behind it all?".  I refuse to provide support of any kind to the authors.

 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 The first CD in the package is a "Greatest Hits" CD.  The second CD in the package was nothing but unheard hip hop stuff and a couple of her hits with the hip hop rythm added to it. Wished I hadn't bought the CD and spent extra money on it 
 Like many of the other reviewers I feel cheated.  Anything contoversial was left out.  As a dumb suburban honkey myself, I demand the reissue of this dvd with "Kill the White People".  What good are all those funny sketches if SNL doesn't have the balls to put them on dvd?  I also didn't read any reviews as I assumed I was getting the same product that was put on vhs years ago.  Instead I got scammed.  What's even worse is the "bonus scene" is the Opie Cunningham interview which was already on the original vhs.  Please explain how this is a bonus.  I was furious when the movie ended.  The least they can do is put out a part 2.  I thought I was buying the Cadillac of comedy.  Instead I got the Ford Pinto of crap 
  I would have to say reading this ridiculous book made me more angry and irrated then in recent memory.  McDowell's concept of "new tolerance" is a joke.  If tolerance has gone under some sort of transformation as he contends than I strongly believe it is definately for the better.  McDowell attempts to convince that reader the tolerance of differance is the same as tolerance of evil.     For example lets take the situation at the beginning of the book: The relationship between the mother Monica and the daughter Sharry.  Now conflict arose between the tow of them because Sherry wanted her boyfriend to stay in her room while they were over.  Monica found this upsetting because she's a Christian.  So, Sherry agreed that they would not sleep together while residing at her parents place.  This did not satisfy the mother because she was now aware that the daughter and her boyfriend were having sex.  The daughter did not insist that they be allowed to sleep together while staying at her parents place.  She did not call her mother's beliefs archaic, or even criticese them at all.  What she did do is inform the mother that she respected her views on not having sex befor marriage and therefore will not sleep with her boyfriend while they stay there but at the same she does not share those views and therefore will not stop sleeping with the boyfriend.  Mcdowell  does not agree with the manner in which the daughter handled the situation and utilizes this example explain his warped problem with tolerance, or "new tolerance" as he likes to call it.  A reasonable individual would see that the daughter could not have handled the situation any better.  Like or not just because  Sherry is Monica's child she is still an individual and an adult with the ability and the right to make her own decisions on matters such as that.  Last time I checked this is still a free society.   The incident involving Beverly Schnell; the woman who placed aad in the newspaper for "a mature Christian handyman."  The government found that this ad was discriminatory.  If you think about it carefully you will derive at the realization that it was discrimination.  Schnell did not place this ad on a church bulleton booard or a church newsletter.  She placed it in a newspaper.  Newspapers are meant for the general public.  She has  no right to determine the religion of a potential tenant. it is the same as if she specified a desired race.  For example if the the ad read; "a mature White handyman."  Mcdowell tries to to twist this situation into some sort of example of hypocrisy and intolerance towards Christians. 
 Ripping off King, but with more sex, shallower characters, and a Hollywood ending. Leave it on the shelf 
 Great features and well thought out.  But the quality is horrible.  Mine randomly ejected disks and screen started going bad after only 2 weeks.  Afraid to buy anything Audiovox or EddieBauer after this.  Luckily was returned for refund 
 This poor frightened author! How very very sad to operate from a base of fear so powerful that one must condemn any who vary the slightest in their belief or approach.  Agnes Sanford did good work and devoted her life to helping others.  Most fundamentalists declaring that anyone different from themselves is BAD are simply very frightened people.  By attacking and condemning others they make themselves feel a little bit more secure in a world that is scary and at times overwhelming.  I am so sorry she is spewing this vitriol in an attempt to feel safer 
 The books attempts to give the reader a short introduction or insight into process mapping. Yet, it would go to in-depth for the basics. In addition, the author guises the reader by using different terminology for maps, such as deployment flowcharts, and IDEF models. The astonishing fact about the  book is that in the end it attempts to tell you how to analyze a business.  Readers are better off reviewing rengineering books 
 It's a piece of junk, so save your money and some headaches. Even Dell technicians can't fix it.   My new Dell computer had Norton Ghost pre-installed with a back-up hard drive just for cloning.  It sounded like a perfect setup except my Norton Ghost wouldn't work.  Contacted Dell three times and they supposedly coordinated with Norton to no avail.  Now I'm stuck with saturated backup hard drive that is useless to me 
 Title says it all, "play to your strengths".  No need to read the "book", or if you must, simply skim at your nearest Borders, Barnes & Noble, or fave store with a reputable coffeehouse.  My quibble is less with the authors' philosophy and more with their writing.  This is simply not a very well written book--no chapters, bold headings every five sentences, and endless laundry lists (43 at last count) of things to do, ways to manage, etc.  Although I agree with the need to appreciate the talents of each unique individual and not dwell so much on a  person's need-for-improvement areas, I did not think the authors proved their points.  They were content to slap down some famous names, rehash a few entrepreneurial successes, and quote the Gallup polls (which were self-serving anyways in light of Clifton's ownership of Gallup).  Please try to waste your money on something better written 
 Bought this crib tent after reading all the "fine print" about returns.  Besides, toilet seats etc. which Allegro Medical does not allow for returns due to hygenic reasons, Allegro Medical made it appear that you can make returns within 30 days.  Not when I tried to return this.  Allegro Medical said all returns were "up to their discretion".  They would not allow me to return this despite the fact I didn't even open the box.  Very misleading & will never buy from Allegro Medical again 
 I just listened to the whole record on AOL Listening Party. There's no doubt this record will be heralded as the best McCartney record since Band On The Run, but what's really up with Paul is every record is worse than the last.    As far as I can tell every tune had a fragmant of an idea behind it, which was then turned into a tune in the studio.  By the time the bridge arrives, McCartney is hacking out uninspired chord progessions layered with horrible, clumsy lyrics.   I feel sorry for the guy from Radiohead.  He must be dreading the diplomatic reviews he is sure to recieve from artists he has done good work with 
 This book does not describe the evolution of consciousness but rather the evolution of unconsciousness.  It describes the work scientists have done in determining the limitations and inaccuracies in consciousness thought.  This is useful in helping frame something as poorly defined as consciousness.  However, mostly you can get this from your Psyc101 text.  The worst is at the end where Ornstein introduces a sort of Sufi mysticism as a substitute for the reason he believes is so flawed.  This is a poor substitute that falls apart at the first rational question, why should I believe this new system which has no evidence for it, as opposed to any other?  You know the book is flawed when a single paragraph he quotes from William James "Varieties of the Religious Experience" has more insight than the rest of the book.  Readers who are interested in what Ornstein is trying to commmunicate are better served by reading William James 
 Paralysed Age is O.K but I've heard better. "Bloodsucker 2000" is my favorite track on this CD but it all sounds rather bland and seems to cater to the misfit "goth" teen scene. Save your money or better yet get The Vampire Lucan Wolf's CD "Vampire Nights" it's alot more fun and better produced 
 Sorry to say but this book is a dud.  While the concept of presenting interesting mathematical facts is great the presentation is so brief, so wrought with errors, and so incomplete that the work is not worth perusing.    Some of the "chapters" have answers at the back of the book and some do not.  It appears that the author could not make up her mind wether this was to be a "math tricks" book or a "popular mathematics" presentation substantiated by theory.    There are many other excellent books that are more fulfilling.  Journey Through Genius comes to mind.   All in all a disappointing work 
 Looking back on this album, it really lacks any of the elements that make the "classics" by Billy Joel truly special.  Blow by blow: "That's Not Her Style" - fun rock song. That's all. "We Didn't...Fire" - Just listen to the music and ignore the words - this is just a terrible song. "Downeaster.." - okay song "... Extremes" - Pop/rock-ish; good piano solo. "Shameless" - he should be for writing this one. "Storm Front" - decent, but feels like he's forcing it. "Leningrad" - interesting lyrics "State of Grace" - nothing special "When in Rome" - forgettable "And So It Goes" - now this is a special song. If you really like the B. Joel songs that dig deep and you feel every note and lyric, this is the one. You're better off downloading this one song than buying the whole album.  Get yourself the "Songs in the Attic"  album and call it a day.    
 After reading the storyline of this movie, it seems like a framing movie, so I didn't even bother to watch it because framing movies piss me off.   
 Do you have any that I can study on 
 I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one 
 It's bad enough that this man is allowed to walk freely, let alone remain a public figure.  Anyone who participated in the brutal terrorist war to kill hope (and tens of thousands of people) in Nicaragua and El Salvador has as much of the moral high ground as does Osama bin-Laden.  It's really amazing how the public believed the lies told to it about the Sandinistas.  A country where the capitalists keep their capital and are free to badmouth the government in a big daily newspaper doesn't seem like a "Communist Tyranny" to me 
 I gave myself a headache trying to watch this  d.v.d    It should have been a most enjoyable movie but the quality of the d.v.d was so bad it was unwatchable. (I  must say here that the fault was in the d.v.d not the d.v.d player as I have not had a problem watching d.v.d's before.  or since.    I think something should be done to ensure quality of production when  running off d.v.d's 
 As a bicycle enthusiast who has owned CatEye products for nearly 20 years, I eagerly attached this light to by mountain bike and went for a spin around the streets and trails of Manhattan. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with its overall usability.   The light uses three intense bluish-white LEDs that are very easy to see from a distance when facing the light. However, these are not powerful enough to illuminate a trail, road, or pothole. In short, the light is excellent tool to acknowledge your position to oncoming motorists and other cyclists.  The flashing mode is especially easy to see. Yet, the light is simply not powerful enough to illuminate the ground before you.  Hence, it is basically useless if you are trying to avoid potholes on roads or vehicle barriers on poorly lit bicycle trails.  Pros Good Construction Multifunction Waterproof  Cons Insufficient brightness Uses AAA instead of AA 
 I'll be blunt.  I didn't care for this book.  I bought it thinking it would delve into the subject of the Gnostic Sophia.  Instead the author goes this way and that and hardly even mentions Her.  I really think the title was misleading.  As a sidenote, Lucifer is given a bad rap in this book and many concede that Lucifer plays an important part in later understandings of Gnosis 
 I used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way I want my hair cleaned.  Not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. People have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores, that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. In the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have. Jonathan is not the only good product out there. I have been using Phyto Shampoo from France and Kiehl's, both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes, the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. Get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!! I used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the Shampoo. I have not tried the conditioner, but will try it too. 
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 This was a terrible disappointment.  More of a memoir than anything about book-collecting, it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was.  There seemed to be no context or fabric to the book.    There were, however, HUNDREDS of references to obscure authors, actors, film-writers, magazines and books.  There were pages at a time where I was completely lost because I had no idea about whom the author was speaking, but he wrote as if the person was well-known to the reader.  Baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in Australia, thence to Britain to the US and ending in France.  Again, there is no context.  He would flip from a reference to the obscure artist, to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book.  If viewed as a book about collecting books, you will not learn much.  If viewed as a memoir, there was little that was interesting about the author's life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions.    There were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector, but they were too few and far between.  If you could not tell by now, I can not see much reason to read this book.  I think Mr. Baxter flattered himself to think that either he or his collection would be of general interest 
 After the second chapter, I had to keep telling myself to "stick with it." I know there is a story in there somewhere, but I felt like I had to really dig to make the discovery. I wanted to take the book apart, cut out paragraphs and chapters and paste them back together in a different order to find a cohesive story. On the positive side, there are some interesting characters and I did enjoy a look at the dogs' side of things. I won't say that I wouldn't try the author again, but I will not be recommending this book to my friends. 
 Very poor choice for a cover photo. Jason should have been a man and took off his mask. This is really a book for diehard redsox fans only. The avrage baseball fan will choke on it. Stephen king should stick to what he does best,, Horror. Maybe he should write about this Redsox season 
 As the reviewer from Jackhorn, KY stated, this book lacks original research.  If you read the section on the "house church movement" and then go to the website for The Homechurch Homepage, you will see that Mr. Wolfe hacked away at many of the articles on the site to obtain his "research."  For the many quotes he used from the website, not once were any of the authors contacted by Mr. Wolfe in order to do any original research.  If he had done so, he would have come away with a different take than he wrote in his book 
 Gary Schwartz writes like a classic Phallic Narcissist, a clinical term used to describe people who elicit his type of behavior.  Isn't it curious how he espouses over and over again being a "clinical psychologist", when in fact it is a LIE.  Anyone who would lie about their credentials, would lie about their results in research....don't believe the hype.... 
 I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. 
 This movie should get 0 stars,This movie is a waste of time for people in the 9 and up age group when I went to the movies and it is just stupid,If they make a second stupid movie like this,ill get sick 
 Don't be fooled by the inscription on the cover.  This book is classic only in the Harlequin Romance sense.  The premise could have been interesting if the story itself wasn't so annoying.  The main characters are a man driven by an obsession and a compulsively grieving widow.  I felt like handing out referrals to a good psychologist.  The language is stilted and slightly off-putting.  There are a few moments in the book which could be touching, but were handled ineptly by the writer.  
 THE ALMOND has become a phenomenal bestseller in Europe, in France alone it has sold over 50,000 copies. One German critic has hailed the author who uses the pseudonym (for all the obvious reasons) of "Nedjma" as a 'literary guerrilla fighter.' Such was the mania for this book which claims to be a semi-autobiographical account of a young Moroccan woman who leaves behind a loveless arranged marriage for her Aunt Selma's house in Tangiers, where she meets a Europeanized doctor and becomes his lover.  I agree with a previous reviewer, Shapour, when he states that this book would have never received a line of notice if it hadn't been written by an Arab Muslim woman. Despite the critical hoopla from Europe's literary nitwits, this book is simply a catalogue of every kinky sexual activity one could think up. The story alternates, chapter to chapter, from the childhood and youth of her village to her experiences with the sexually psychotic Driss. But, long before Driss ever laid eyes on her, Badra was a sick little pup herself. Her memories of sexual experiences with friends and cousins, dirty old men and her morbid fascination for the village prostitutes are simply --excuse my American queasiness about mixing little kids and sex--disgusting. Regardless of the highly charged subject matter, "Nedjma" has the writing style that reminds one of a shopping list. A dry narrative of the far-fetched sexual encounters of dull people. The sexual awakening of a Muslim woman? Good for her! The rest of us though are falling asleep from her monotonous ramblings about sex and love and more sex. Some, I'm sure, are also throwing up after having read about Driss' grandmother and her young servant girl having sex while he watched. Nedjma/Badra (or whatever your name is) you need to go back to bed. And that means back to sleep, so try keeping your hands to yourself - and off yourself.  This book has received little attention here in the United States. If you haven't read this piece of psycho-porn yet, count yourself lucky and spend your time with something better worth your time. THE ALMOND is a bomb (I still love the book's cover however) 
 I am extremely dissapointed with this book. It has been assigned to me for graduate school and I dread picking it up to read assignments.  I am studying for my Master's degree but this book requires you to already have a PhD to be able to understand it. I guarantee that in at least in every paragraph you will have to stop reading to look up at least 2-3 "new" words.  This book was not written for students.  I feel sorry for anyone who has to read this book for any studies. Good luck!It's boring and confusing 
 Mitchell gives us "everything I try to intuit about Jesus' life," and assures us that "scholars show a remarkable degree of consensus" with his intuitions. "I wanted to compile a gospel," the authors earnestly offers, which rejects as "polemic" those New Testament references which are not properly Buddhist, and references which we are instructed that "scholarship" rejects on the "ground base" that they are not "authentic", not "historical." Mitchell gives us Jesus the Zen master, the member of the spiritual elite, a Jesus that stands with the "other Masters" -- Spinoza, the Buddha, Lau-tzu. The operative ad hoc hypothesis here is that Christianity is mostly, as the author is fond of saying, "legend." We do yet find, in Mitchell's tamed revision of Jesus, a most profound body of teachings. But at what cost? Humanist revisions of Jesus have been suggested for three centuries now. They are generally exercises that must be false to the most plentiful documents of pre-modern history. Mitchell's cited "scholars" are, if you haven't guessed, members of the Jesus Seminar, and certainly do not reflect "a remarkable degree of consensus" with a broad sampling of New Testament scholarship. Mitchell justifies his preferred revisionist version of Jesus on the basis that Thomas Jefferson and Friedrich Nietzsche seem to have also preferred such a Jesus. The influences in Jefferson's and Nietzsche's worlds were different, but in no way less prejudicial than in the world of the early church. Nor can any conjectural club of 18th or 20th century "historians" or "scholars" examine more accurately the historicity of the Christian canon than could Matthew, Luke, Paul, John, Justin, Polycarp, Clement, Origen, Cyprian, Eusebius, Jerome, Augustine, and thousands of other witnesses, many of them martyrs for their knowledge of the man Mitchell calls a sectarian legend. Toward what end would "the Evangelists" have produced a false Christ, these men who died lonely and hard deaths for the "legend" they are said to have invented? Certainly not to conform to a convenient conjecture or a popular philosophy of socio-aesthetics. At the outset, the author magnanimously concedes that there may be something he is missing in the texts that he rejects. Perhaps they are not what he understands them to be. Many scholars who are not members of Mitchell's 'consensus' will quickly find that Mitchell is indeed missing something. He sets out to miss something. His characterizations of the references he rejects are typically heavy handed in their straw-man structuring. It is given that we are to accept the so-called Gospel of Thomas on an equal historical footing with the canonical gospels -- something Christianity has always rejected -- we are then to use it as counterpoint to the canonical gospels and to conclude that the gospels are thereby poisoned. A straw conclusion. His exegesis appeals to arbitrary authority and is typically precommitted to a personal aesthetic (as compared to the work of serious minded exegetes like Origen or Augustine). In the profundity of Jesus' commandment of love, and in the intimate presence of the Kingdom of God, the author seems to think he has found the Jesus that is unknown to Christianity. It is sadly true that this has often been the case, but it is also far less than wholly truthful. I will say that many -- Augustine, Francis of Assisi, Wesley, Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Sadhu Sundar Singh, Bonhoeffer, Teresa of Calcutta, and Desmond Tutu, for a few diverse examples -- have understood these teachings of Jesus better than does Mitchell, without needing to reinvent Jesus. In writing of these things, however, Mitchell does offer some thoughts worthy of close examination. He is correct in finding, in his pared-down Jesus, a teacher of moral philosophy that resembles Lau-tzu, and a body of teachings that resembles the Tao Te Ching. There is, of course, no historical or cultural connection, but in this resemblance we find universality to all coherent ethical codes and thereby a strong case against moral relativism, as has been pointed out by C.S. Lewis, for example. Good is Good and Truth is Truth, even if it is only part of the truth, and even if it is mixed with fabrication. Thus this volume is not without some measure of merit. This cannot overcome the fact that the book presents, and yes, polemically so, a contrived and personally convenient version of history, a contrived and personally convenient version of Jesus 
 Solo para aclarar.  Sera imbecil el ke pide luces por esta fuente xq' de fabrica no las trae asi ke esperemos ke ese tipo de comentarios no se repitan, para esa gracia mejor se buska otro tipo de fuente mas colorida.  Salu2.. 
 The only thing that kept this from being ABSOLUTELY predictable was that a dead bad guy did NOT spring back to life.  I found myself saying "Oh come on" to one plot point after another (previous reviewers have covered these absurdities).  The underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving (previous reviews in this thread provide details) 
 This book was on my eighth grade reading list, so I read it, and was disgusted by it.  First of all, the book has NO STORY!  it's so dull, that it put me to sleep.  a bunch of events happend, like people dieing and babies being born, but it seemed as though all of those scenes were similar, if not the same.  they weren't connected in any way that was interesting, it was just like a series of tedious events with no connections whatsoever.  I do not recommend it for anyone really, except for maybe younger kids, because it was written at such a begginer level, with such a basic style of writing 
 Despite Mr. Moeller's "brand-name appeal", I must confess I found this book disappointing. The title promises too much perhaps; how can mere 300 pages cover the matter for a practitioner? Written in an informal style, it paints on a broad canvas -- the kind of material that would do well for an after dinner-talk for auditors, but most definitely lacks depth and specificity. It could be useful for students or business managers, but is unlikely to help a professional auditor much. Browse through it first to see if it answers your needs before putting down your money. 
 Terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features.  Pulls multiple papers through, so you must start again.  Is a G3, which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-G3 fax machines - WRONG - so you can't fax to 75% of the community that has a non G3 unit!  I thought I was buying quality from Canon when I paid $250 for this hunk of junk!  The cheap Brother and HP's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use, and much less expensive.  Save your money and save the headaches!  Sorry Canon, this product was a disaster 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 Former Justice Department researcher Quinn Marlowe discovers the decomposing body of her friend Alicia at her seaside cottage. The last time she saw Alicia, she was incoherent, appeared to be suffering from a breakdown, and disappeared into a limo. Undercover US Marshall Huck McCabe is jogging by when she makes the grisly discovery and tries to aid her. And he continues to have a growing interest in her as she investigates the events surrounding Alicia's death, bringing her to the very people he is trying to link to a vigilante group headed by a wealthy CEO that was a victim of kidnapping.  Quinn's snooping gets her into hot water and it is all Huck can do to get her to abandon her search for her own safety. But n the grand tradition of being far too stupid to live, she not only continues to investigate, but alienates mot people she comes into contact with, thus putting herself in the forefront of danger.  This is my first Carla Neggers book. I felt like I was in the middle of a two hour movie that had already been on for at least an hour and a half. There are so many characters - most with little background to differentiae them from others - it was obvious that this was one of a series of books. I struggled to tell them all apart (many only made a casual entrance in the story then disappeared altogether). The synopsis on the back made the plot sound interesting - but it was a truly disappointing read. I found the minor characters like Nate Winter and Juliet Longstreet more interesting. And lo and behold, they have their own stories 
 So, poor Brooke Shields felt unhappy? So what? Is she unaware of the billions of people on this planet who live desparate lives of real poverty, who watch their children die of preventable diseases or starvation? Is she unaware of all the babies who die from malnutrition and malaria every year? And all she can do is sit in her mansion and feel sorry for herself. Of all the times in one's life, the time you are needed most is when you are a mother who has just had a baby, yet still she couldn't feel her own baby's love for her. How pathetic. I think she'd have soon changed her tune had she been marooned on a desert island after a plane crash, and she realised she could die any moment. People get 'depressed' because they spend too much time thinking, and thinking about THEMSELVES. Don't these pathetic people have anything better to do with their lives? Think of all the suffering she could prevent if she used her fame and money to do so.  She should read "Stop thinking and start living" 
 This album starts with the terrific "Loser's Day Parade", but everything after is weak by comparison.  Even if there is some good production, there's little quality songwriting after this first track.  Tracks 2 & 3 have good moments, but each have at least one overwhelmingly cheesy part that makes you not want to play it for your friends.  After track 3, I'm totally done with this.  If Kino kept the quality of the first track throughout, this would no doubt be a 4 or 5 star effort 
 This book is virtually unreadable. While reading along, you may get the beginning of one sentence, and the end of another. Don't waste your money on this book 
 A friend recommended this book to me as a treat in preparation for my vacation to Charleston with my mother.  So I sent her a copy for us to read together.  It was not a treat.  I was disappointed there were not enough descriptions about Charleston and the Low Country.  I've been to lovely Charleston and Beaufort and this book didn't make it recognizable.  I agree that character development was shallow.  What was that mess in Mexico that made no sense?  And, nothing is more aggravating than reading a 'professionally' written book with TYPOS!  And repetitious descriptions.  The ending was implausible and a rush to have some closure.  PLEASE do not compare this author to the talented Pat Conroy.   So we waded through the 'pluff mud' of Islands, and are giving Siddons another chance with Peachtree Road, but my mother has finished it, calling it 'bizarre'.  Gee - can't wait 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 I had this opener and tried it with about a dozen cans and it lost its sharpness and now it was in the trash can.  It's expensive for such a gadget and didn't work 
 I selected this model primarily because of its price. Unfortunately, the remote control is defective. It will turn the volume down, but not up, and won't turn the television on or off. I contacted Olevia to request warranty service using their website, but two weeks later have received no response. I called the number listed on the website, but was disconnected after being placed on hold for about 10 minutes. The television itself is really more of a monitor. It didn't have enough connectors for me to connect both a cable box and a DVD player. I had to buy a device that would allow me two switch between the two 
 Flat, boring, pointless, plain stupid. Guy gets too pretentious with all that bunch of alleged existencial symbolism, whatever it is supposed to mean. His writing style is quite poor, he uses tons of cliches, and presumes to be telling more than he does. Too kitshy to be true.  I would give it a -5 star if I could. Just stay away from this garbage 
 I have no idea whether Morehouse's story is true, or completely made up, but I will say it reads like the latter. I don't believe in conpiracy theories in general not because I don't believe a government would do something bad, but that they could successfully cover it up. It's against all human nature not to talk, especially about something big, so I don't believe secrets are easy to keep nowadays. That said, Morehouse's book reads like badly-written, paranoid "sci-fi"...not a well-written book, neither believable nor entertaining 
 In the 12/4/05 issue of the Week in Review section of The New York Times, Charles L. Harper Jr., senior vice president of the Templeton Foundation - the preeminent foundation seeking a bridge of understanding between science and religion - said, "They never came in", when Intelligent Design proponents were asked to submit research proposals to his foundation. He added, "From the point of view of rigor and intellectual seriousness, the intelligent design people don't come out very well in our world of scientific review."  Mr. Harper's comments demonstrate what the Intelligent Design movement really is: a pseudoscience barely masking its religious origins which pretends to be a credible alternative to "Godless" Darwinism. However, in stark contrast to Darwin's theory, Intelligent Design has yet to offer testable hypotheses to confirm or reject its principles. Instead, in stark contrast to rigorous scientific reasoning, it has relied instead upon faith and badly flawed probabilistic and statistical reasoning from Michael Behe, and especially, William Dembski (William Dembski seems to have a lot of time on his hands, since he's managed to publish more new books than Niles Eldredge and Frank McCourt combined in the past five years. I wonder how he manages to find time to do any serious research into probability theory and statistics.).  I agree completely with Tim Beazley's Amazon.com review which notes the strong religious affiliations of most of the contributers to this volume. Furthermore, I would emphasize that most of these writers appear to come from a fundamentalist Protestant orientation (Though I can assure you that there are anti-evolutionists who are devout Catholics, Jews and Muslims too.). None of their arguments in defense of Intelligent Design are sound logically or philosophically. As I have noted in my Amazon.com reviews of "Of Pandas and People" and "Uncommon Descent: Intellectuals Who Find Darwinism Unconvincing", Intelligent Design is not only unscientific, but it is the latest manifestation of an idea which was soundly rejected by 18th and 19th Century scientists. If we are prepared to embrace "Intelligent Design" as a "legitimate" scientific theory, then should we also accept a Ptolemaic cosmology, especially when all modern astrophysical evidence strongly rejects such a cosmology?  Instead of reading this book, which should have been entitled "Signs of Ignorance", I would recommend reading instead Niles Eldredge's "Darwin: Discovering the Tree of Life" or Lisa Randall's "Warped Passages" if you want a genuine exploration of true scientific discovery. I would also recommend reading Robert Pennock's "Tower of Babel" -  since it has a brilliant rebuke of "Intelligent Design" - and my friend Ken Miller's "Finding Darwin's God" for a lucid, persuasive explanation as to why Christianity is not incompatible with Darwinism 
 This is a useful cookbook for reference, but it is not something that I feel is absolutely necessary in my cooking library. As a regular cook and a breast cancer patient, I found the recipes to be basic modifications of ordinary recipes.   If you are struggling with a specific side effect of cancer, then this book does offer helpful organization of foods/recipes for that purpose. It is useful in that way. On the other hand, I think most cancer patients find a core group of foods that they tolerate well, and stick with them through treatment. Also, talking with other patients and reading internet articles has been more useful to me than this cookbook. Sorry -- but I really think this is just another way to market something to cancer patients. We're vulnerable once we're diagnosed, so watch out.   
 I found this cookbook difficult to interpret.  I am not someone who can cook without specific instructions, and this cookbook does not provide them.  The pictures are good; the meals are good, but none of that matters if you can't figure out from the instructions how to make it.  It seemed like Shelley Young skipped a lot of the recipe instructions and assumed people would understand 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
  I do not recommend this book!!! I took so long to finish it. Do not read it. You will fall asleep in minutes!!!!!! 
 I read this book and was vastly disappointed. It should not be placed on the same shelf as David Drake or David Weber. If you want a good book with a good story line, plenty of action, and any type of ending to the book at all stay away from this book and go with something else 
 I was excited when this movie showed up in the mail and immediately put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch.  It didn't take long for me to realize it was a cheaply made film.  The story was interesting and had it been done in a better way, the film could have been great but after having seen movies such as Trick and Latter Days where the acting and production quality were very good, I found myself feeling dissapointed after only a few moments.  It is not a movie I would readily recommend 
 There is some very helpful information in here about how a woman's cycle works. I would be very cautious, however, about the nutrition information. Here is my story:  I was ovulating every 16-18 days with a 11-day luteal phase. Hoping to ovulate closer to every 14 days and lengthen my luteal phase, I began taking the vitamin Optivite, so heavily recommended in the book. I took Optivite for four months, and in that time I would either ovulate extremely late--30+ days followed by a 9 or 10 day luteal cycle-- or NOT AT ALL.   For whatever reason, I didn't immediately connect my ovulation problems with taking the Optivite (seems so obvious now). Then I read something from another source about how excess vitamin A can inhibit ovulation. I then QUIT taking Optivite. My first cycle off of Optivite, my ovulation returned to normal-- and THAT IS WHEN I FINALLY GOT PREGNANT.  It may be that Optivite has helped other women who were really deficient in some of those vitamins. But, in my case, I guess I was healthy to begin with, and it just screwed with my body 
 There are some writers whose books are so, well, just plain bad, awful, terrible, dreadful, etc., etc., that they're a waste of perfectly good paper.    This is so bad--  It deserves to be blamed for global warming.    
 The series' main flaw is the repetetiveness of the storylines, somehow even though I watched the episodes back-to-back I still felt deja-vu. The plot wouldn't advance for episodes, and I think this is what caused the ratings to plummet, they took too long to flesh out the plot so, the fans grew bored. Also, what contributed to my feelings was the showing of several identical slides in every episode! That said, it still was a fun watch, the bonds shared by the twins, Chobi, Lisa, and the enigmatic Kaze are really interesting and often funny(when not pertaining to Kaze of course). Also, the villians were not malevoloent, just mischevious which only served to affirm my opinion that this anime is more oriented towards kids. I'm not sure about the mechanism used to rate if it's final fantasy or not, but I think the fact that they had crammed all the plot twists in the last episode contributed to the criticisms, I think if the animators took some of the sub-plots out and focused on the storyline this series would've been good, instead of just decent. As it is, it's still fun, and at a bargain price; if you have nothing better to do, go ahead and watch it!(2.5 stars 
 After really enjoying the first 3 books in this series I began to find it to be rather formulaic.  And the characters have begun to be annoying rather than charming.  Amelia is self centered, Hannah is rigid, and Grace has no spine at all.  I found myself being irritated by them instead of curious 
 I found it on sale- luckily because it did not work. Cute as the dickens and came with a great strap and the art program was fun for the kids- but no go on the camera. Never able to get it to power up- yes fresh batteries too. We were very disappointed : 
 Vanilla Sky is quite a disappointment considering the presence of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, and Penelope Cruz, among others! The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond "below average!"  Tom Cruise and the rest of this AMAZING cast are given terrible lines and bad roles.  A shame, really... The dialogues-oh my- the dialogues are beyond words... As for the plot, school plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better storylines!  It is truly sad... It seems as though the writers/directors/producers decided to go artsy-fartsy on us, following in the dreaded footsteps of other such "films" as It's All About Love and the Russian Ark. So it's a weak plot, and a GREAT-but-wasted cast and setting, which when put together fail to take off.  No masterpiece here. 
 This book should never have been put together.  Many of the works are butchered.  Sometimes not even the original title is included and it seems that authors are missing from several as well.  He even butchers Aesops fables -- guess he doesn't want to overtax young minds with the full versions in all their splendor.  Of course, many of the selections are classics, but what he's edited out leaves me not only cold but disgusted.  If your kids internallize some of the slop used to demonstate these virtues, it will be hard to erase a number of pernitious misconceptions later 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 This edition of "James Bond: The Secret World of 007" is rather superfluous. The produces of CASINO ROYALE have indicated that this film is going to be a new beginning for James Bond. If so, the 20 James Bond films in the series that preceded CASINO ROYALE really have no continuity in relation to this film. Therefore an edition dedicated solely to this film would have been more appropriate. Just end it with the sections in addendum to DIE ANOTHER DAY. The James Bond based in the Twentieth Century had a good run 
 This is a collection of academic essays on gay cultural products from Latin America, Latino America, and Spain.  Unfortunately, the stodgy texts on ancient Spanish authors often drown out the cool articles about gay US Latinos.  You may want to read it for the great essays about Reinaldo Arenas, especially given the success of the film about him.  However, you are better off buying "Eminent Maricones" by Manrique or Cherrie Moraga's books 
 This is the first Patterson novel I have ever read, and it is certain to be the last.  Most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in-depth characters, but Patterson does none of that.  The author's writing style is akin to that of a small child's, as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one-dimensional characters.  Patterson then holds the reader's hand as he matter-of-factly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation, presenting a book written by a Ralph Wiggums-like child for immature children to enjoy.  How does the reader know Alex was scared? The reader knows because Patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style: "The man pulled out a gun, Alex was scared, Alex shot the man and he was happy, and the man was dead."  Don't believe me? Simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch-nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare I had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who I thought he killed, or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist's evil deeds.  Quite simply, this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs 
 Damn Yankees were an 80s supergroup featuring the "Motor city Madman" Ted Nugent, Tommy shaw (from Styx), Jack Blades (from Nightranger) and Michael Cartellone (from...er,Cleveland).   HIGHLIGHTS: "Coming Of Age" is the big guilty pleasure here: unapologetically un-PC and darn near irrestible. (You know you sing along when it comes on the "Big Hair Weekend" radio shows.) "Runaway", with its catchy hook and huge stacked vocals, could be a longlost Journey song. (I mean that as a compliment.) "High Enough" was the big power ballad and it's probably the best tune here lyrically, as Shaw hopes to win back the woman he didn't commit to quickly enough, though it's more about how she makes HIM feel than a desire to inspire happiness in her. ("Can you take me high enough/To fly me over over yesterday?")  LOWS:   "Damn Yankees" is the American revolution as told by Ted Nugent. ("Suck on the barrel of my hot shotgun/Smile when you say "Damn Yankee"") Argh. "Rock City", apparently, is the Delta. ("Well, I've been to London/I've been to France/I've been to Mississippi/Where they taught me to dance") I guess KISS lied. "Tell Me How You Want It" is a high school locker-room level comeon. ("You and me gotta run like the river/This dam's about to break/Rolling like thunder from above I'll take you there") "Piledriver" is more of the same, though I'll grudgingly admit that Nugent's sass in delivering it ("'Mr. Nugent do you think my skirt is short enough?'/I said, 'Baby, you want to be alive you've got to piledrive!'") makes the most of a paint-by-numbers crotch rocker.  BOTTOM LINE: It's bubbly, has just a little bite going down, and tastes alright. But it's just not filling in the end and you can't really do well on a steady diet of it. (Hence the title) Most of us will do fine with "just the hits" (ASIN B0000630Y8). The whole CD is for unrepentant ripped jean rebels only.    2 1/2 star 
 I'm not sure what audience this book was aimed at; I never figured out where it was trying to go.  I could sum the whole thing up like this: Through very bad judgement, promiscuous white-bread chick gets into hairy situations as a photojournalist, and into stupid situations with men. Then she writes a whiny book about it. The End. Seriously; if you pick up an autobiography, the author owes it to the reader to have something interesting to say. Or so I thought. In this case the writer, Deborah Copaken Kogan, seems to have mistaken what might interest her girl friends with what would interest the general public. This book is like College Writing 101. Sleeping with lame guys and getting into a handful of dangerous situations doesn't make for interesting reading. The sad thing is that every potentially interesting topic gets sidetracked to make her look like the victim and/or 'cool' . For example, if you follow a bunch of Mujahedeen around in Afghanistan, I think the average reader would want a little more historical and cultural background on that conflict and less "Please feel sorry for me; I haven't bathed in a month and I'm out of tampons". Her "It's-all-about-me" american tourist worldview get's really boring really quick.   As for the art of photojournalism; don't expect to learn more about photography than you would taking a class at the local community college (Leica's are expensive? Really?) And the sleeping around? I, as a male reader, could care less who a woman sleeps with, but jumping in the sack with obvious A-holes and then expecting sympathy from the reader when she finally wises up is pathetic. Trying to portray this as somehow 'liberated' or 'feminist' is so White Suburban it's laughable.    The one thing that could have done a lot to save this book is MORE PHOTOGRAPHS. Even in the hardcover, there's just small, b/w images.   I liked the 'idea' of this book, but I think it just failed on all counts because the subject herself is so uninteresting.       
 I bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they wouldn't leak like the last ones I had used.  They don't leak, but the stage 1 is TOO slow and frustrates her.  She's 5 months and the stage 2 is TOO fast.  They made a HUGE mistake in not making more stages.  Had I realized this before I had used them, I would have taken them all back 
 Haven't read the book yet...just received it today.  I just want to make sure that ANYONE purchasing the Constable edition expecting a Hardcover edition should know that Amazon's description is WRONG.  It is a trade paperback (aka: a larger than 'normal' paperback)......NOT A HARDCOVER!!!!!  The only reason the price is higher is because it's a UK import..... 
 This book covers most areas of engineering, as advertised.  However, I find it doesn't have enough depth to allow you to solve real world problems in a field of engineering one is familiar with, while at the same time, doesn't give enough background to allow you to make good use of the formulae in fields that you may be new to.  In other words, it is written somewhat obtusely.  That's fine if one just needs a refresher of what one has learned before or elsewhere, but makes it difficult to use in a new area 
 I was very disappointed with this product.  I was mislead when I read in the product feature section that these shoes were "Made in Italy".  That's not correct.  They're made in China.  The bottom is that these shoes are very uncomfortable. 
 ...and not really suitable for experienced Work-Shop leaders. I tried this book to get a sense of the quality of the books in this series. Personally I consider this book as too basic, and I must say that the quality of the provided material, such as for instance the slides, is not the standard I would expect. I would recommend this book for not so experienced trainers or people that would want to run an inhouse workshop for their own team. 
 A tribute is defined as "a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude, respect, or admiration."  That is what you have here. But, if you want a true picture of that incredible morning, don't waste your time and money, look elsewhere 
 there's nothing interesting about a singer who had a good voice but just gets by now.and who slept with the Boss.who does average Material at best and that's a reach.she is a tacky turkey 
 Gray is so far off the target when it comes to nutrition and exercise.He says women might gain weight from exercise? Didn't he ever hear about if you burn more calories than you take in you'll lose weight? Simple math Gray!Everything about this book smacks of sell,sell,sell! snail oil salesmanship.When will he  realize people have different needs bssed on individuality rather than gender.No one has any business making the blanket statements he makes,it's irresponsible. Another very corny statement is women get good brain chemistry from affection and cuddling,while men get good brain chemistry from sex.How much longer is society going to promote these  myths? Bad advice,irresposible and plain corny 
 I have sold a number of this style timer made by KitchenAid in Pink , Black and White. Almost every buyer complained. All complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room, have a fan on or are listening to the TV or radio. Replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either. If you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the Red, Black, Blue, White or Tangerine ones that are entitled Digital timer with rotating dial - no one has any complaints over this style of KitchenAid timers. 
 dear sirs, as a matter of fact ,we need to know if this book is usefull for processing of potato chips and can this book help us for using a better technology for oil consumption in our production.since we are researching  on how we can reduce oil in potato chips 
 This book was obviously not written from experience. Minnery pretends to be an expert, but falls way short and even shorter as an author. I've read non-fiction accounts that have far more useful information in a few  paragraphs than this whole book has. A real disappointment, don't waste  your money or time 
 I was expecting really much much more from my dear friend Mike Pingel. I was really dissapointed. Amateur work, low quality paper, all photos are black and white and very low quality, no color pictures, very  bad design, mislabelled articles and photos and a whole amateur feeling throught the book.  Really dissapointed.  Christos 
 After weeks of delaying my shipment I was told Amazon could not get the book for me .. 
 Richard Florida divides people into two groups, those in the creative class such as artists, musicians, and engineers and those not in the creative class, mainly people not engaged in so called "creative work". Based on his research into the characteristics of these groups he concludes that India and China are not the real threat in terms of high tech competition and it is the smaller European nations with more open political climates that are the real threat.  Obviously, Florida is not an engineer or a real scientist since anyone in the high tech field knows that India and China are the main competition for high tech jobs and the massive offshoring of engineering jobs is even lowering the number of students in college pursuing these fields.  The main problem is that Florida doesn't realize that an engineer with a 4 year university degree is not the same as a writer, musician or artist that may have no education at all especially in difficult math and science courses.  He mistakenly believes these two separate groups to be equal and the same in terms of contributing to high tech innovation and development.  For writers an open political climate is necessary to make a living writing controversial books.  However, for an engineer an open political climate is not essential in most cases but a stable  modern environment where he feels confortable living and working is needed.  Furthermore, Florida makes a huge deal about the "Gay Index" where high concentration of gays indicate a high concentration of the creative class and high tech innovation.    This may be true in western civilization but in China and India it is irrelavant.  Florida also seems to have given up on his "Technology" element of economic development for America because in his latest article for USA Today he states something to the effect that high tech innovation can be outsourced anywhere and America can only maintain its lead if it concentrated on "culture", "art", "music" and "improving retail service" jobs.       In conclusion, Richard Florida's creative class theory where "Talent", "Technology", and "Tolerance" is needed for economic development is fundamentally flawed.  Florida's writings lack the rigor and unbiased analysis of a real engineer or scientist but is designed to sell books to a socially liberal audience.    
 Don't repeat my mistake: I failed to read the reviews first, and am sorry I purchased this CD.  This is the best song selection of Neil Diamond I have found, and "Remastered Original Recordings" was exciting.  But, as some of the other reviews noted, these are definitely not the "Original Hits".  A swath of these songs are from (much) later concerts, including one song where it sounds like he had a very bad cold and was only croaking along because he had to finish the performance to get off stage.  "Call me a relic, call me what you will;" I like the hits better and will have to buy another CD to get them 
 A glorified cliche, this book does little justice to Shakespeare's writing ability as it isn't nearly his best work. Its marvellous dissemination and public love and recognition beffudles me. Superficial, lackluster, and diaphanous often foolish and loathsome compourtment and intelligence of the characters makes this book nothing more than a wonderful waste of valuable time. Never has Shakespeare created a work so imbued with cliches and idiocy. Basically, Romeo and Juliet is a story about two romantically-impaired "star crossed" lovers who have to avoid the obstacles presented by the feud between their families to realise and consummate their ephemeral marriage. They arent star crossed! They are inane idiots too immersed in "love" to recognize the imprudence of their actions. Their deaths were not the least bit pitiful, but risible. Cognitive, yes. Irritating, yes. Interesting? No. The utter folly of the characters is murderous, very uncharacteristic of Shakespeare who usually presents intelligent and philosophical personages. Do not base your opinion of Shakespeare on this pathetic work, he has created and transcended this one with a myriad of his other much more meaningful and enthralling plays. I d much rather recommend Midsummer Night's Dream or Hamlet 
 This book is a horrific let down.  While admittedly no one expects to it be the next Lord of the Rings, I have rarely read a novel as poorly written and unbelievable as this.  I found the entire book felt like it was written by a grade 9 student.  Medically, it was accurate, but english wise, it was atrocious.  While reading this, I felt like it was a glorified Nancy Drew books, you know, the ones we all loved when we were 6 or 7 years old.  the characters are superficial and unbelieavle, the scenerios and plot are even more artificial.  The character of Tony is one of the most unrealistic fictional characters I have ever come across.  It was pretty obvious the author knew absolutely zip about organized crime when he wrote this book.  Overal, a very poorly written and unbelievable book.  No one is expecting Shakespeare, but we're at least hopeing for some entertainment.  This was painful to read 
 This is just the latest of so many books that view normal adolescent development primarily from a problem perspective. Sure, there are challenges in adolescence for both teens and parents, and sometimes there are major problems to be addressed. But most adolescents, and parents, somehow manage the old and the new complexities of this period just fine. For a more positive approach, I recommend Laurence Steinberg's "You and Your Adolescent." Another fascinating book by Steinberg focused on school-related issues is "Beyond the Classroom.&quot 
 I had high hopes. But this book does not deliver. First, it's a kind-of guide for parents traveling with VERY young children. Second, it offers only the most basic common-sense advice: "Don't drink the tap water in India" kind of thing. There is a book to be written on this subject but this is not it 
 Sorry, if one is casting for a MUSICAL movie, one should actually cast actors who can SING, not just actors who have big names. Sophia Loren couldn't carry a tune to save her life.  I love musicals, but this is one I do not like at all 
 I'm a Pagan, and I do not hold this book in high esteem.  And there is plenty I could say about the book and its author.  I've tried to do that in a couple of Amazon reviews.  But they were deleted, so if you really want to know what I think of this book, you will have to e-mail me 
 Don't just skip this vac but avoid ALL Shark products. I can echo what a previous reviewer said....The unit will die on your after minimal use. I made the mistake of buying two sharks, this one and a small hand held one for my car. As soon as I use the hand held for more than a minute it gives off a a burnt rubber smell. This one began to do the same after being used only two or three times and died completely on the fourth clean up. The container was never really full so it was not a case of overload on either unit...at least not user overload. My best guess as to what is wrong with this product is that they put some great filters on a cheap motor. The motor isn't strong enough to pull the dirt through the filter and quickly burns out. They had to know that when they made these. What a rip!! 
 Dreyfus' understanding of distance learning is quite limited. On page 39 of this book he defines distance learning as "the correspondence-course model of anonymous information consumers." Distance learning has a lot more going for it than that, I have found that there is a lot of interactivity in online courses and a high level of communication with the professors. I took one of Dreyfus' classes at Berkeley as an undergraduate and I never got to talk to him, there was no face to face learning. If you feel that the lecture method is the only way to learn, then the internet is not for you. If you want to feel like a "disembodied presence" go take a class at Berkeley as an undergrad 
 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I tried really hard to like this book, but I found it just a poor rehash of information already put forward by William Sutherland D.O, the father of Cranial Osteopathy and John E. Upledger, D.O., O.M.M., the developer of CranioSacral Therapy.  For a true Visionary approach to "CranioSacral" work, you should consult the works of Sutherland and Upledger 
 I am stunned that a book like "Lightning" would sell even one copy.  Mine was given to me, but should have been tossed in the trash instead.  I cannot begin to talk about what is wrong with this book because there is nothing right. Worthless!!!!and pathetic and beyond.  For heaven sake if you are really of fan of Steel's (I find that hard to believe) than check it out of the library, do not waste a dime on this trash. "Lightning" discredits all women and is a sham.  It does not deserve even one star 
 As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher "Finnegans Wake" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.  I first tried reading "Finnegans Wake" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.  However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Dumas, "Les Miserables" by Hugo, "War and Peace" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, "Notes From the Underground," "Crime and Punishment,"  and "The Brothers Karamazov." These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.   In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.   Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. "Growth of the Soil", by Knut Hamsun, and "The Master and Margarita," by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over "Finnegans Wake" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as "Finnegans Wake" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece 
 I had to read this book for a history course.  I would suggest to everyone who reads this book to do so in a quiet place with no distractions.  Keep a dictionary handy.  There is so much information that you should read this one section at a time.  For those of you doing a research project it is a good book to have.  Lots of interesting statistics but not fun to read 
 I've always enjoyed Siddon's descriptions of the locations and milieu of the characters in her books, and this one continues at a high level on that score. But the plot line was not engaging. Very slow. I kept waiting for something intriguing to happen, as it does in other of her books. I'd skip this one and read another of Anne Rivers Siddon's wonderful books 
 I waited until I had read books 2 - 8 before I read this first book, and I was glad I did, because I wouldn't have read the other books if I'd read this one first.  But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.    My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda.  The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught 
 Would have been a better book if the author had stuck to the subject of Freemasonry instead of spreading misinformation about the OTO.  The author does a disservice to the reader who might not know any better, as well to the many fine Masons who enjoy membership in both Freemasonry and the OTO.  Perhaps if he had spoken to one of these Brothers some of his misconceptions might have been corrected and I would encourage the Brother to consider interviewing a few Masons who are also OTO members for any subsequent editions or other books so that information is more factual and less sensationalized 
 Maybe my expectations were too high; The Killing Floor did win the Edgar for best first novel, but I guess it must have been a weak year. Lee Child's first offering is typical of a first book, and that's the problem the story is typical. Nothing surprising or new here. It is both predictable and implausible. The book's hero, Jack Reacher, is boring. I think he is supposed to be mysterious and troubled, but I found him grating and arrogant. The book reads like a B action movie. The whole plot not only stretches the imagination, but also one's grasp of reality. It seems that Child has never left New York City and understands neither the American justice system nor small town life. Maybe I missed something, but I found The Killing Floor to be a sub-par thriller with flat characters and rather large plot holes 
 The book basically covers three subjects.  First, a political and historical background of Iraq and Saddam - Excellent.  Besides the history primer, Mr. Keegan also has some thought provoking, if negative,  remarks about Islam (or at least some of its variants) which I may research later.      Second, the events leading to the second gulf war - Poor at best.  I agree that Saddam had to go, preferably sooner than later.  Failing any political progress, war was a likely outcome.  Having terrorized his citizens, started two major wars and having a record of NBC/WMD weapons research he wasn't someone anyone felt comfortable having around.  The UN embargo wasn't working and medical/food shortages were killing up to 50.000 civilians a year, according to some pre-war estimates.  Mr. Keegan jumps firmly, but clumsily, into the pro-war bandwagon.  The issue of missing WMD is never really addressed very well.  Did the Western intelligence agencies really drop the ball?  Or did the US and the UK lie to their citizens in order to drum up support for an unpopular military intervention?  If it wasn't a lie, could the intelligence agencies have done any better?  If not, what lessons to learn from that?  His characterization of opponents to the war is lame.  Mr. Chirac?  "A braggart".  Europeans? "idealistic Olympians who do not recognize the need for force".  And so on...  Now, I dislike Chirac myself. But a skilled author owes his readers some balance and, especially, more justifications.  The French do have a long and shameful history in Iraq.  Selling weapons.  Having their defence minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, refer to Saddam as "a new Napoleon" (which is praise, in France at least) after 1988.  Looking happily to the end of sanctions to sell more stuff in an area without US competition.  Given all that, France deserves criticism, but Mr. Keegan doesn't bother to argue his case by mentioning any of it.  The BBC also gets nailed for its "biased coverage", again without any arguments to support that position.  Personally, I rather liked their coverage and thought its bias less visible than Keegan's.  And, no, I don't think that hoping for a future without wars is silly.  It might not work out, and sometimes (Rwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia) it is better to go to war after all.  It is necessary to resist dictatorships such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.  But you can't fault pacifism as being only for silly idealists.  It has, for now, all but stopped wars among Western nations and it has instilled a healthy distrust of "colonial interventions" by most of those nations' citizens.   Third - the war itself - Not all that great.  There is some high level analysis of what units were moving where, and what they did.  Some coverage of local action, plenty of other interesting stuff.  Keegan is in in element here.    What there isn't is any interviews of Iraqis.  Or any detailed info on Iraqi activity during the war. No Iraqi is mentioned by name outside the usual suspects covered by CNN.  Everything is from the Allies' viewpoint.  I don't blame Mr. Keegan for staying out of Iraq right now.  But it makes you wish that the book was written ten years from now, with Keegan having been able to do his usual world class research.  Nor is there any analysis of how the US should face the Iraq insurgency, despite the 2005 addition to the book.  With current events being what they are, we need people like Mr. Keegan to reinvent themselves as analysts of low-level, guerilla warfare, terrorism, etc...    But this book is more informative about the perils of writing history books too soon, before the facts emerge fully 
 Im comparing this album to social distortions self titled album so of course it is not near as good.  If you are going to buy this album make sure you listen to this BEFORE you listen to social distortions self titled because if you dont your gonna hate it like i did...honestly i wouldnt even buy it.  the songs are so-so but i think they could have done way better.  only two stars for me 
  I haven't seen a movie so one-sided since the Contender. They didn't even try to make good arguments for the pro-gun side. I hate to use the term Liberal Bias but in this case it fits like a glove. The cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie I felt like the gun companies were the underdogs. Pure garbage.   
 Terry Pratchett's only written four bad books of which I am aware. This, I suppose, is a sign of genius -- when your work is so consistently good that a small slip-up is so glaringly obvious. It doesn't help Carpe Jugulum, though.  The Witches are the least interesting of Pratchett's sub-worlds, since Granny Weatherwax is simply too confident and sure of herself for us to really believe that anything can threaten her. Her cohorts are simply not as funny or interesting as Death's family, the University Wizards, or the Night Watch.  The storyline here is also something we've seen many times before; something strange and modern is invading the Discworld, and the native forces have to oppose it. In this case, the threat is a bunch of vampires who play by modern rules instead of traditional; they like garlic, they ignore holy symbols, and so forth. The Witches mobilize to oppose them using a combination of clever tricks (which don't really make sense) and blind optimism (basically just hoping something lucky will happen). The subplots involve the arrival of an Omnian revivalist in Lancre, some strange avian life, and a bit more of the fairy-tale cliché from Witches Abroad; none of these subplots actually go anywhere.  Really, this is the exact same plot as Lords and Ladies, but not as well executed. It's still not Pratchett's worst (that's hands-down Fifth Elephant) but it's certainly nearly as much fun to read as his other works 
 The graphics and sample marketing materials in this manual were so cheesy, I could hardly keep a straight face. Without a doubt, it dated this material and made it seem useless to me. The information was alright.. but still pretty basic, and sometimes too random 
 The protagonist in Cosmopolis is Eric Packer - a 28 year old billionaire who spends a day crossing a gridlocked Manhattan in his cork lined limo to get a haircut. Eric is one of the 1990s Masters of the Universe - his life is ruthlessly pared down to ensure maximum efficiency, regular meditations ensure an icy calm, he ensures his body is kept in check by having a doctor give him a rectal examination inside his limo and he gets his mistress to pour chilled vodka on his genitals for kicks, he has also taken a reckless punt with his fortune on the fluctuations of the yen. In other words, a raving lunatic.   As other reviewers have noted, Cosmopolis seems icily detatched from any realistic paradigms. The characters are so freeze dried that any sympathy for them is nullified, the action takes place in a hyper-croweded Manhattan filled with a Sufi rapper's funeral, pastry assassins, political protests, a Presidential visit all on the same day. Even pre 9/11 New York didn't have days as insane as this. The dialogue is coldly intelligent, like in White Noise and Underworld, but at least in those novels the ideas espoused were interesting. In Cosmopolis the central themes of capitalist uber power and rampant technology seem dated and the pared down Delillo style seems almost android, as if his characters were computer generated rather than homosapien.  It is funny, several major authors have tried to cover the overdrive atmosphere of New York circa 2000 (Fury - Rushdie, The Diviners - Moody) and all seem to be terrible novels. Perhaps this era doesn't lend itself to good literature, perhaps it is too recent to be made into art, or perhaps this pre 9/11 golden age only existed in the minds of wealthy US based writers 
 This book can't find it's niche. Even though it is commonly classified as a "teen" bood, the language in the book is as bad as "Scarface" or "Pulp Fiction", with the "f-bomb" being as common an expression for these teens as "awesome" was for teens in the 80's or "cool" in the 70's. This could be excused if the characters were interesting, but the characters on sit-coms are more interesting than the supporting characters. The supporting characters throughout the entire book are wooden props for the author to make social commentary, and after a while it feels like one is being beat over the head by it.  The only thing "adult" about the book is the themes discussed. Let me sum them up for you: rampant consumerism ruins everything it touches, being a non-conformist is not without a cost, big business is bad, humans are destroying the Earth. Pretty common dystopian SciFi pablum; these themes have been done before, better.  One of the most shallow, hackneyed ways to develop pathos, the sickness of a child, is used in this book. Predictably, the impact is superficial, much like driving by a train wreck, interested yet disconnected, but able to drive on with the rest of traffic.   I wanted to like this book, the themes explored are important to think about, and the "feed commercials" are truly great satire. However, at the end of this book, there was a general feeling of, "Well, that sucked. 
 This item was a big disappointment and a waste of money for me.  I love TamiLee and her Arms and Abs video from a few years ago.  That's why I was excited to see what I thought was a newer production of Arms and Abs workouts.  The cover was different than the video and there was no reference to the older video in the description, so I thought the DVD contained all new workouts.  The 3 Arms and Abs workouts were exactly the same as the old video, so did me no good.  I didn't buy the DVD for the lower body workouts, but viewed them just to see what they were.  Two out of three are somehow cued incorrectly from the DVD menu, meaning you select workout 2, for example, and the DVD takes you to the cool down session from workout number 1!  Because sequential workout video tapes are still easier to use for home-exercisers than DVDs since you don't have to remember which workout you are on - you just stop the tape one day and restart the tape another day - this DVD is just a back-up for the tape I already use 
         This album, overall, was not what i was expecting to get.  I thought I was going to get an entire album of songs like "The Promise", however after that opening and amazing song, the rest of the album goes into some sort of adult contemporary music thing.  Bottom line: this album is only worth it for the song "the Promise", unless of course you're a fan of adult contemporary 
 The question titling this review is the one a potential reader needs to ask prior to choosing this book. The story of this astonishing work of art, gifted by Frederick I to Peter the Great, has been the basis for many books both scholarly and purely fictional. While this book is non-fiction it is not one I would recommend to anyone that is unfamiliar with this topic. The room that is the title of this book can be viewed online as it has been reconstructed, and once seen the viewer has a right to expect a written history of this fantastic creation that both approaches the unique beauty of the art itself and the incredible journey the room may have taken.  The mystery/history of the real Amber Room has all the makings of the most remarkable of fictional thrillers, and while the authors present a sturdy, competent narrative, the book never gets very interesting. The prose is dull and does as much of a disservice to the true tale that black and white photographs do to the real Amber Room.  The book also suffers from a constant handicap of; wishing for something just does not make it so, every attempt at breathless suspense reads as labored, contrived and often very predictable. If you have never read about this topic search elsewhere as the subject is fascinating, if you are already a reader of books on this tale again you should look further before adding this to your reading list.

 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 I could be wrong but when i looked a this item i thought it was going to be a router that would interface to my DSL line. all it is a cheap firewall with a switch not at all what i wanted. the discription should say 4 port 10/100 Router. 
 When I learned I was expecting triplets, I bought a large inventory of these bottles which I thought were the best out there.  Boy, was I wrong!  These bottles leak, not just once in a while but with almost every feeding.  I am constantly "double checking" them in hopes they won't leak all over my babies.  I now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they don't get soaked when - surprise! - the bottle leaks all over them.  Yes, I've read the directions and no, I don't over tighten the bottles.  You can't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag.  They are especially leaky when I prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator.  There is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal.  The bottle must be disassembled, the top wiped dry and then reassembled.  Lots of fun with three bottles - especially for 3 am feedings.  Even if I am doing something wrong, a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product.  If I hadn't bought so many, I'd throw them all away and get something else.  Take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often - they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation 
 As a St. Jeanne d'Arc devotee, I have read quite a bit on my favorite Saint, as well as seen my share of movies.  Some were well done, none have been definitive, and others are, well, like this one.  I usually try to be a bit more intelligent, but the first word that comes to mind when I think of this particular version is CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Historically innacurate, spiritually unfaithful, this film stinks.  It is downright heretical, portraying our beloved Jeanne as having made a pact with the devil.  She is shown as a proud, haughty girl at odds with her Church.  What a bunch of bull.  The ONLY two bits of this film I appreciated were the attention given to her ring (given her by her brother), as well as the scene when she brings a child back to life (I am unaware of any other films on her that portray this true story).  Other than these, it took a lot not to walk out of the theatre when I went to see it.  In other words, BLAHHHHHHHH!  Don't waste your time, money, or soul on such non-sense 
 Before you read the book, look at the sources.  I only found one scientific paper out of hundreds of sources. Everything else has to be classified as opinions.  Sources for this book  include news stories and testimonies in congress.  I will point out by two examples (not from the book, but from information that you are probably familiar with) why these are not good sources. I recall the news stories based on the opinions of experts that said it would take five years to put out the oil well fires started in the first Gulf War.  They were all wrong.  It took six months.  CEO's and others testified before congress about tobacco products being non-addictive.  Were they correct? No! So when we read this book, we can't be sure of anything.  It is a book of opinions and ideas.  Some of them may be good, but they may also be bad.  This is why we have science and the scientific method.  Even science may be corrupted at times or fail until we have a better understanding. Even if Mr. Gore had scientific papers, it is unlikely that he could judge whether they really support his environmental views.  He would need a Ph.D. or at least a lot of experience in the proper field(s) to interpret scientific papers properly.  This book discusses how corporations are unfriendly to the environment. Surely some of them are.  But so is the government.  When the government plant at Fernald, Ohio, (near Cincinnati) was accused of poluting the soil and water with radioactive waste, the government denied, dragged its feet, and fought in court. The government lost it case because there was obvious guilt, but the government did not hestitate to fight against the very people it represents. When you or I appear to be at fault in an auto accident, do we admit it and offer to pay all claims, or do we take a less candid approach as our insurance company suggests?  We might even think we are not at fault. Mr. Gore has denied being at fault countless times in his political career, but he can't believe that a corporation should do anything but admit guilt, accept every environmental claim that is made, and pay large sums of money.  Mr. Gore is an elitist.  First, he believes that he is an environmental expert because he has heard a lot of opinions. He doesn't need an advanced degree in environmental science  or experience in that field.  He just knows better because he is Al Gore. Secondly, he sees how he uses the environment and how you should use the environment quite differently.  When he was Vice President, he flew to Kyoto, Japan, to symbolically (read unnecessary trip) approve the Kyoto Treaty.  He used more than 180,000 gallons of fuel in a private government plane in one day.  My wife and I can drive our cars and heat our house for our lifetimes and never use this amount of fuel.  During his Presidental campaign, Mr. Gore would fly a private jet to his son's games.  I have no great objection to the former Vice President doing these things as long as he doesn't start telling me how I am abusing the environment, that I should drive an electric car, ...  I do have trouble believing his environmental views are anything but political.  If you like the views in the book, read it and feel good.  If you don't like the views, read it for some good laughs.  There are plenty of flaws.  Books like this make money, but they don't make good science, and they don't produce good policy.  Don't forget to recycle the book 
 They are no good. The first 6 songs are terrible. I know 2 hits came off of this: "No Excuses", and "I Stay Away", but they stink as well as "Whales and Wasp". It's a shame that they rushed this out after breaking through big time with "Dirt", but I guess the label knew best. The best on here is "Swing On This". This is another bad memory of my first few months in FL. 
 There is no doubt that Antonia Fraser's "The Journey" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly engaging style (although I must say that I never before heard of sex described as "lugubrious.") There is also no doubt that Fraser has done a great deal to redeem Marie-Antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the French people. The book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. However, I was disappointed to see that Fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. For one thing, why does Fraser act like Marie Antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? What about Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (Catherine the Great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? This sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. I was glad that Fraser did not fall into the myth of Louis XVI's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. She simplistically portrays him as being asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed "it." But never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of Fersen and the queen fiddling with  primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. I must say, it is a first. Fraser insists that Marie Antoinette slept with Fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. I usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character, but I guess Fraser does. Oh, well. It is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. I found it absurd when Fraser insists that the tormented queen of France was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the French people now enjoy. If the queen had had her way, her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the reality of it. For a better study of Marie Antoinette's relationship with her husband, I would recommend Vincent Cronin's "Louis and Antoinette." As for better biographies of the queen, let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of Delorme and Bertieres will soon be available in English 
 Imagine the biggest bore or show off you have ever had the misfortune to be waylaid by in a plane or at a party. Now you've got the idea of this book. Apparently, the writers, instead of sharing their travel and food adventures, engage in a sort of "Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, I've been to Timbuktu and you haven't," monologue. Since the Travelers' Tales series books are usually pretty good, this was disappointing.  An example of how very bad it was, in one article about bad road coffee, in the first paragraph Tom Bently reminds us how he kissed his Krups. He couldn't just say "coffee-maker," but he must share with us the upscale brand name of his coffee maker. How gauche can you get 
 I am using this book for a financial derivatives class and it is very poorly written especially for someone new to derivatives.   ** The book does not have complete definitions, explanations on topics or clear examples:    I have had to buy a couple of other books to understand some of the concepts he talks about. Either he will just define and let you figure out on your own why a trader might use that particular strategy or give you some information but no example of how it would work in real life.  ** He jumps all over the place:    I found it difficult to understand some of the concepts as  either he would abruptly stop talking on a topic and start on something else or mix things which I feel do not make a whole lot of sense. My classmates feel that he just collected a lot of material from other books or online and chopped and slashed the material till he reached some size. (maybe his publisher/editor told him there is a word limit ;) ).   ** The questions in the back of the chapter are either not clear or not easily solvable(cannot be answered from the material in the chapter or deriving it from the material in the chapter)     I have had to spent time at CBOE, wikipedia and other websites to understand what he talking about and to answer the questions. (Had to do it for class)  After reading 6 chapters and spending countless hours trying to answer the questions at the end of the chapters, I feel that I have not gained anything from this book other than a list of topics to search google on.  Just to clarify, I am used to books on complex topics (3rd Masters) but have not seen a more confusing book 
 Not much to say about this item it sucks. very thin and cheap made. Does not seal at all and does not keep the bread freah This is the worst product i have every got from Amazon. 
 The key to simple living is to simplify your life.   I don't think the author has really figured that out yet, because this book tries to cover sooooo much information and sooooo many ideas that it just misses the whole notion of simplicity. It made me tired just to try to read it (and I am a very avid reader!).  While the author means well, and has some good advice for those just beginning to try to find a simpler way of life, she tries to retain ALL the facets of life you may possibly want to ever consider trying to "simplify". It reminds me of those alternative "light" recipes for overly rich foods: the real point isn't to create less caloric forms of the recipes, the point is to stop eating that kind of food.  Simplify, simplify! I am afraid as an old practioner of voluntary simplicity I was confused and depressed by this book, which seems to offer very little in the way of true simplification and much in the way of things-I-didn't-know-I-should-be-worrying-about.  Simplicity: Get rid of anything you haven't used within the past year. Pay off your credit cards and just keep one or two for real emergencies. Be monogamous. Give your time instead of money to those you love. Turn off the TV. Think about how to live with only half of the possessions you have and then DO IT. Eat fresh, simple, whole [organic] foods. Drink water. Create a garden and spend time in it (instead of watching TV). Let other people worry about "getting ahead", status trips, newer cars and bigger houses, trendy clothing. Read: How To Make Your House Do The Housework.  If your kids don't like it, they can complicate their lives all they want when they grow up, but at least they will know how to LIVE first.  Oh, yeah.

 The first Merry Gentry novel was a great Who-dunnit.  The following novels began to slow to a stand still.  Where is the Story in this story? As erotic prose Ann Rice does it better and still delivers a plot.  It would be a welcome change if the characters ate a meal or had a non-foreplay conversation.  I am not sure I will bother with the next book 
 The good news is that the motorized SkipDoctor is easy to use.  Unfortunately, the bad news is that it doesn't work.  I tried to repair two disks, parts of which had become unplayable.  After the process both disks appeared to be badly scratched.  Again, the good news is that the process didn't make either disk play any worse.  But it also didn't fix either disk's problems.  Save your money.  
 The ones that are posted twice do not work. If they are posted once, you can try to download it, but it might not work. The video only worked for about a minute. Shame, since I really like this show and I wanted Amazon Unbox to be cool. The one cent CSI works, go download tha 
 I had heard alot about this movie when I was a kid. So when I saw it on DVD I though it would be a good time to see it. I was wrong this movie is Bad and Boring. My advice, don't boy this DVD! 
 Hearing a lot about this book, i decided to finally check it out myself. a christian friend (a fairly devout one) told me about it as being a great source and great argument against all the different objections and problems people bring up concerning the gospels and the New Testamant and Jesus's divinity in general. I had read much of the New Testament and had many personal questions and objections (mainly contradictions that arise from comparing the christain faith as it is practiced today to the scripture on which it is based).   What i found exhasperated me. reading all the reviews for this book shock me even more. The only thing that i like about this book is the fact that he addresses most of the arguments against christianity and Jesus and much more. I also like the fact that it does provide plenty of rebuttle arguments against those objections (although unsatisfying).  What i really think is a major failure is the fact that his book only made it more clear to me how poor the case for christ divinity really is.   One of the biggest issues for the case for christ is scriptural support of his divinity (being God himself). I had raised some questions before reading the text about verses that really diminished such claim. Strobel does indeed address these points but all he does is show how these points really prove the Jesus was NOT GOD. i couldn't believe the arguments posed by the scholars and how readily the author was ready to accept whatever the scholars said.   An example: In Mark 10:17-18 Jesus replies to a man who just referred to him as a "good teacher" "Why do you call me good? No one is good--except God alone". Strobel brings up this point. can you explain how Jesus would say that if he was God??? well aparently the scholar can! the scholar explains this verse away by saying that jesus is really saying "do not call me that. do you really understand what you're saying when you say that? Are you really ascribing to me what should only be ascribed to God?" then the scholars proposes that that could be teased out to mean " I really am what you say; you speak better than you know"!!!!! and then the author just accepts that as a sound explanation of this verse and moves on. now the objection i have about this is that someone who would come and look at this verse objectively without a background in contemporary christian theology would NOT get that message out of it. for example, if a muslim, believing that Jesus is a prophet just like moses and abraham who's purpose is to guide people to the belief in the one true God, would read that, he/she would easily interpret that to say "God is good, we are not" just as simply as it is said by Jesus. as in, relatively Jesus is not good but rather God is good so aspire to His (God's, not Jesus's) Standards. In other words, the scholar interpreted that verse from a christian bias and lense and did not interpret it objectivly. i provided the Muslim example to show you what you get out of a biased interpretation based on prior believe concerning the topic (a muslim background for example).  this is only one of many examples throughout the text where it is clear that there is verey little objectivity in the interpretation and answers provided by the scholars which really makes me wonder just how strong of a case does Christ (at least as being God himself) really have???  I think my point is clear. go read it and find out for yourself 
 I have read some of her other books and I believe this one was not up to the others. I found the character very "whiney" and not very redeeming. This book seemed more "cookie cutter" and not as funny and/or clever as her others. I was disappointed-especially in the ending and her choices 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I love Gwen Stefani and No Doubt, adn I figured, to tide me over until the Sweet Escape, I'd get one of ND's older CDs since I have all of them Tragic Kingdom and on. It was between their debut and this. since Beacon Street got rave reviews, i bought it over the self-titled one.. When i popped it into my stereo, it was only alright. Some tracks were ok, but some made me feel nauseated and I could only listen to it for the first 5 seconds. *cough* blue in the face *cough* The only songs that I liked were By The Way and Doghouse was ok. I lovvveee by the way though. Overall its worth two stars for me. [I love the inside of the disc all the pics are so cool. I also like the disc with all the little band members!]  A 
 You're writing a poem or song. You've got one word, and want a rhyming word. So you need a rhyming dictionary.  Look up the word you know and find other rhyming words.  How simple does it get?  Well with this dictionary - forget it.  This is arranged NOT alphabetically by word, but by vowel "sound". They have transformed what should be a simple process into a chore.  
 Mr McKay knows his subject and could have written an attractive slim volume.  As it is, he has given us a fat ugly one.  Ironically, the worst aspect of this book is its UI and for exactly the reasons that the author  is at pains to explain.  The giant headings are distracting, the over  printed chapter numbers, just silly, etc.  To compound the irksome UI, the  author insists on recycling every sentence he has written over and over  again - this undoubtedly bulks out the book, but it does nothing for this  user's experience 
 The flight into New York had been a long one; but I was gently revived when Kirsten Dunst met me at the airport.  She was to be my escort that night at the Lincoln Center where the President would present me the Distinguished Writer's Cross-the highest award this nation can bestow on an author.  I quickly slipped my only suitcase in the backseat and sat next to her as she drove her Mercedes S class sedan to the Waldorf Astoria downtown.  "I have to admit that I didn't you who you were until I read STARLESS GRASSLANDS.  I don't mean to embarrass you; but that book changed my life."  I tried to be polite and gracious toward the compliment.  For the remainder of the trip we had a nice conversation while I approved the fluid motion of her hands and legs as she maneuvered the controls of the automobile.  I very much approved of her legs.  As I departed the car, Kirsten leaned toward the open door to catch my eyes.  "Don't forget.  I'll be by at seven so we can go to the ceremony together.  Please be ready."  I expressed gratitude for her generosity and promised to be waiting for her seven sharp.  The hotel staff greeted me and soon I entered the elevator for a quiet ride to the eighty sixth floor.  As I entered the suite, the steward took my request to have my suit blushed, prepared and returned in a few hours.  Finally, a bit of peace.  I poured a small measure of whiskey into a chilled tumbler and then walked over to the large window looking out over the city below.  For a few moments I contemplated the remarks I was to make at this evening's formal ceremonies, then I heard the hushed movement of stocking feet behind me across the room.    I turned around and out of the bedroom to my left in walked Sandy Bullock dressed in a black sheer see through cat suit.  "Well, Crabby, aren't you glad to see me?"  Before I could recover from my surprise another set of feet wisped across the floor from the sitting room on the right.  It was Jennifer Aniston dressed in the same black sheet cat suit.  "Sweetheart, don't look at her.  Come here to me."  "Get out!" screamed Sandy.    "No, you get out.  It's not fair.  I left Brad for him so I get him!"  The two of them stood in angry silence staring at each other for a tense moment.  Then Sandy leapt at Jennifer and instantly they were in a bitter fight hissing and scratching each other.  It was a ferocious sight as pulled hair, shrieks of pain, and nylon tearing could be heard.  Then almost a quickly as it began, the fighting pair disappeared into the sitting room.  Several sharp punches were heard then a definite thump as a body fell to the floor.    Sandy marched back into the room victorious.  I ran to the door of the sitting room only to see Jennifer laid out on the floor out cold, spread eagle and naked.  Before I could think of what to do Sandy tapped me on my shoulder.  I turned around and there Sandy stood.  A little worse for wear.  Trying to catch her breath.  Nude with her torn cat suit draped across her feet.  "Forget her.  She won't bother us now."  Sandy brushed the stray hairs out of her face, smiled and stepped out of her nylon costume.  She posed standing and anticipating my admiration.    "Now I'm all sweaty and warm.  I need a shower."  Sandy turned her lithe body and walked into the bedroom and into the bathroom beyond.  I turned around and wondered what I should do for poor Jennifer still laying unconscious on the floor.  Then I heard Sandy calling.  "Crabby, why don't you come and help me?  You could soap up my......"   OOPS!!!!  Sorry!!!  Err...just a little fantasy of mine.  I meant to honestly review this movie but my more realistic nature took over.  I swear my pitiful fantasy is actually much better than the story told here.  You see, the cover of this DVD displays Ms. Bullock prominently with her name in big font letters.  But in truth this movie focuses on Tate Donovan as the main character and only on Ms. Bullock as his unlikely love interest.  As much as I "love" Sandra Bullock, I have to admit her filmography has not been kind to her.  Her best films have been WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING, WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY and the much-unappreciated HOPE FLOATS.  Unfortunately for each of these gems are several terrible movies like FIRE ON THE AMAZON, HANGMAN, SPEED 2 and this movie.  The plot revolves around two "losers in love" who are unappealing both in looks and personality.  Donovan comes across a love potion from a gypsy woman (an unrecognizable Anne Bancroft) and soon both Donovan and Bullock have the most desirable members of the opposite sex at their feet.  All goes well until others find out their secret and Donovan and Bullock discover that their true love is actually between each other.  The story is predictable and unfortunately not very funny or all that sweet.  Chances are you can find a copy of this DVD fairly cheap and it is not a bad way to kill some time while you're waiting for your own boyfriend or girlfriend to get off work-or your friends to wake up from their naps-so you can really do something worth wild. 
 This guy gets two stars since he is one step above a street performer.  His music is a bad resurrection of old-style Blues from the South.  He gets more popularity he deserves, but thats true for most mainstream artists of the 2000's 
 The film not only didn't do justice to the book but also lost the feel, the atmosphere and the message. Christian Bale, a fine actor, is horribly mis-cast. Some key scenes were lost from the book and I question the choices made by the writer and/or director with regards to this. Obvious commercial decisions caused this film to lack the emotive power that was so evident in the novel. Read the book, forget the film 
 The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.  Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time 
 Very basic information. This book is for the beginner just learning the ropes about eBay. If you have been using the site for some time now, then you know just as much as whats in this book.  The resources for sellers to find "wholesale" products were terrible. The sites basically sell junk or overpriced refurbs 
 I am not using this bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to set up.  Instead, I cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plug-and-play 
 "Wise Blood" could more aptly be called "Stupid Minds."  Both titles are tendentious, but the latter is more accurate.  Ms. O'Connor depicts a pair of Southern troglodytes in the grip of religious mania.  We are meant to regard their fanaticism as a form of primal wisdom; in fact, it is merely ludicrous or pathetic.  Those who deem this judgment parochial should ask themselves whether Ms. O'Connor, an Orthodox Roman Catholic, was any less so.   Faulkner plumbed the humanity within or beneath the grotesque.  Ms. O'Connor is more interested in the God-driven grotesqueness that warps humanity; she sees it as higher knowledge.  Her prose in this early effort is merely workmanlike, and time has made what was strange or shocking in her vision seem familiar.  If blood wisdom were truly wisdom, an Islamic terrorist would be wise 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 The rafter jig idea was great, but there just wasn't enough info and detail to actually build it (I thought).  I must admit, I'am not a pro as this book "by pros for pros" claims, but I guess if I was a pro, then I would probably find the information in this book to be too elementary.  This book is ok for learning roof basics, but it's not enough info and detail to fully learn all that's involved with building roofs 
 I have been waiting for this book for a while as the publishing date slipped a few times. Having recieved the book, I wish I never bought it. To start with 2/3 of the book is about java, optimisation, a poor section on JDBC and some networking stuff that you can find anywhere else. The remaining of the book is a general discussion of Java and the last chapter (Ch 15) is about a simple 3d engine (jist 3D)which is pretty incomplete. The book has many incomplete code snippets and no games in sight which is surprising when the authors have been around the game development forums for such a long time.  The book seems to be a poor attempt in discussing games development in Java. More like an attempt to cash in the market demand.  If you are buying this book to learn about Java and 3D, then there are better books such as -Developing Games in Java- by Brackeen which has good explanations about various aspect of game development in java.  My advice is that dont waste your money on this book 
 Bought this to replace my old 2200 Ipaq; Man what a mistake! The battery is always dead, even after the HP tech support for hours on 3 seperate occasions; Patch downloads done nothing, lost information, reloads, Bugs to many to mention. I wished someone would have warned me of this pda model before I purchased it. All the good features it has don't hold a candle to all the troubles it has. I'd be very careful if your looking to buy this model. Da 
 I was offered this as an add-on to my order ... so I didn't see a picture of the cover ... this is VERY elaborate - not one or two sheet oragami (guess I thought all Oragami was 3D :)  50 plus pages of small papers to make these - then spray paint or seal them- they look like something out of the 50's, but not something you'd want to remember!!  I had intended this for my nephew but didn't have enough information to realize what it was all about.  May I just wasn't familiar with the whole 3D Oragami angle of things 
 Like most device drivers the Turtle Beach specific driver needs to be installed with Administrative rights. Nothing unusual.  However, when a Non Administrator logs on (as is good security practice) the driver says is needs to be reinstalled, which is not possible without Administrator rights. Catch-22.  Not usable for me as I don't use the Administrator account except for special purposes, a security "best practice". Without the Turtle Beach specific driver it works as a generic USB sound card with the default Microsoft driver(no reinstallation required!). No special sound effects then, so not worth the extra price premium over a generic USB sound card.   Too bad the poor software implementation ruined a good piece of hardware, as when it works it sounds great 
 I know the Inmon vs. Kimball thing has turned into something of a feud. Having owned the first and second edition of this particular book (the first edition is now more useful than ever hollowed out with a knife to hide jewelry) and having browsed through the third edition that a colleague purchased, I must say that the major change since the obscure first edition is that Inmon has now taken a much more defensive tone now that Kimball is out there presenting clear, concise and useful real-world concepts and implementation techniques and gathering followers. I also own Inmon's "Using the Data Warehouse", "Data Warehousing and the Zachman Framework", and "Exploration Warehousing" and the question that comes to mind most after reading through these books is why did I waste the money. The reading is difficult, not so much because the subject matter is difficult, but more because it seems to be dry theory and has little advice on how to actually design a real working data warehouse. When later, Kimball came out with his breakthrough book: "The Data Warehouse Toolkit", it all seemed conceptually so much simpler and straightforward 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 Buying this would not make sense if you A. Bought Batman The Animated Series: Volume One or B. Batman TAS The Legend Begins. If you have one or the other and hopefully not conned by Warner to buy both and think you would want this then you would have 2 and if ur that rare case of ones who bought BOTH A. and B. then you would have 3 Christmas' with Joker. Now I would urge you to buy Volume One and later 2 then to go question yourself if you have this episode and why is this episode on both DVD's. Be safe and read before you buy 
 This is a great magazine, but don't order it through Amazon.  They go through a third party (Snapse Magazine)that has terrible customer service.  I ordered this magazine in January and SIX months later... still no magazine.  I called Snapse twice and was told they had no record of the order (even though I received an email confirmation from Amazon and I have a 17 digit confirmation number).  They said they would research it and get back to me.  No one called or emailed me the status, so two weeks later I called them again.  They acted as if I had just placed the order and told me it takes 6 to 8 weeks to receive the first issue. I won't get my first issue until August.  Buyer beware... it could take SEVEN MONTHS before you receive your FIRST ISSUE.  
 This could have been a nice little movie; it almost is. The plot is blissfully uncomplicated, much like a Marx Brother's film, but even at his oldest, Groucho never seemed as old as Rodney does in this DVD. The idea of going to the ends of the earth to win the love of your lady is timeless. But with a thirty-something leading lady and an eighty-something leading man, searching for your Viagara and your teeth would seem like a more realistic quest. I'm especially disappointed that there were no memorable "Rodney lines" like in Caddy Shack - "Oh that's the worst looking hat I ever saw ... looks good on YOU though." A sweethearted, non-wise cracking Rodney didn't work for me. Honestly, I feel bad not loving this movie. I am a Rodney fan - have all of his records (yup, on vinyl), DVDs and CDs too.  I have seen him live and use his lines all day long - "I went to the doctor, I said doc, when I wake up and I look in the mirror, I wanna throw up, what's wrong with me? he said, I don't know, but your eyesight's perfect!"  But in this film he was mis-cast.  Picture Billy Crystal in the lead and you know what I mean. Anyway, if you love Rodney, maybe you shouldn't see this movie. It's just too painful. I had to go watch Caddy Shack a couple of times to get over it. I originally wrote this review back in June of 2004 - Rodney was still with us and making those around him laugh. He's gone and there will never be another 
 Dangerous Skies is a story that is mainly about two boys that live in the middle of the 1700s.  One of the friends is white and the other one is black so they have a lot of disagreements and they spend much of the story trying to figure things out.  One of the people lives on a farm and does a lot of work on it.  The other one is black so they get a lot of discrimination and stuff like that.  I do not really like this book because it was really boring and it had no point.  If you want to fine out what happens in the end you should read the book 
 I was very eager to use this product.  I had all sorts of various files and clippers to keep up with and I thought this would be a great replacement.  I was a little disappointed when I had to let the hand set charge for over 18 hours before I could get full power.  My disappointment increased when the cheap plastic attachments started breaking after just a few uses.  We can not use the nail filing disks because they will cause a friction pain if you use them at the wrong angle.  I had big hopes for this product but all I got was a big disappoinment 
 The product has far too complicated setup process. The product itself worked well enough after all the steps in the setup. 
 Really Lame ending, If I new The story had anything to do with a father (Donald Sutherland) raping his daughter I never would have bought it in the first place. I don't even think Horror flick is what you can call this movie,  rather it's a story of revenge of a poor innocent girls spirit who trusted her father and was violated 
 There were a few good nuggets of information in the varied chapters; however, most of the content of this book is hopelessly dry and academic.  Seemingly written by professors and wonks for other professors and wonks, I cannot raise the appraisal of Culture Matters above two stars.  Yes culture most certainly matters.  The value sets of peoples around the world determine if they develop and thrive, or collapse into mediocrity.    
 This is by far my favorite Michael Bolton album.  It blows 
 A patched up Free attempts to carry on as normal, but the chemistry is just not there - Fraser is gone and Tetsu struggles / doesn't even try to make the most of the opportunity given to him. Rather than contribute some great bass ideas, he is content just to plod along; Kossoff plays on 5 of the 8 tracks. Gone is the heart wrenching melody and beautiful vibrato of his playing. He's running on remote control. It sounds like he's slumped in the corner of the studio stoned out of his head; Bundrick writes 2 tracks / shares the credits on two others. His work sounds like album filler put there to satisfy the band's contractual requirements. The whole album is Lazarus with a triple bypass.   The only standout track is the EXCELLENT 'Wishing Well'... the other songs are just musical ideas i.e verse and chorus cobbled into a finished song...   another album to buy if you can't stand blank spaces in your Free CD collection... What a tragic waste... 
 Atheists have a lower divorce rate than born again christians but I guess thats just a fluke hu, Ann. They must be bad people somehow. People like Ann can't be christians because they shame one person for having an affair and then forgive another that is an alcoholic because he's a republican. She speaks to people who want to believe so bad they don't care that she doesn't have a christian bone in her body. True christians don't defame, judge or claime superiority. She doesn't have any idea of what being Jesus-like is. Oh and intelligent design is not science. Science is how Religion is why- They are too different questions 
 My first book by this author and I will try to avoid her in the future.   I found the sisters just too dumb to be believed. The hapless victim left to fend for herself is getting to be an old over used scene in a lot of so called mysteries.   They always think the case is solved and go galloping off leaving the intended defenseless and unprotected.    Mediocre story at best.  Don't know where the title came from 
 There are numerous reports that can debunk most, if not all, of the ideas presented in this book.  A far better (free) report on this type of thing is "The Lanning Report", by Kenneth Lanning, an FBI Agent who used to work specifically with ritual abuse cases.  Google for it & check it out; I promise you'll be glad that you didn't waste your money on this piece of junk 
 This film starts well but gets boring past the first 20 mns, despite Winston's effects you can enjoy for about 30 seconds in the whole movie, and I guess for a few more seconds at the very end, which I didn't even wait for... Though everything is well made in that film, it doesn't have the least interest either to a horror fan or to the common viewer, which I guess is the reason why you can find so many low priced copies of it on both DVD and VHS.   There are things that KILL a horror film, like having to hear a jazz piano chorus during a chase scene featuring a "monster" you don't even see anything of but the eyes of the actor who plays it, then you already jumped to something else before anything actually happened. And that's the way it is TO THE END... 
 I had heard about the earlier version(s) of this book as 'a definitive text' on Software Engineering.  Never got a chance to read those versions.  I can only hope that the earlier versions were somewhat better than this.  1. The text is verbose, difficult to read, doesn't help the reader to connect with the thought process of the author.  Given the nature of the subject, dry and rather difficult, it is the responsibility of the author to make it easy to read, especially when the author is a respected member of the software engineering community. The author has failed to shoulder the responsibility.  2. Many a times the text is outdated.  As an example, the whole chapter on Quality Management gives references to text published in 1981 and 1986. The author then claims, "Although these data are well over 20 years old, they remain applicable in a modern context" ... So absurd !!! Does the author mean that the Software Engineering discipline has failed to such an extent that the software industry (in general) is as bad as it was 20 years ago.    3. The organization of the book is pretty bad.  There are too many quotes, WebRefs, KeyPoints.  Some of the quotes are good, but many a times out of context. And when I think of it, one can publish "Quote of the day" kind of a column for more than a year using this book! (not a bad reason to buy a book ... unintented consequences ... it's like a defect in the software which is declared as a feature)   4. And finally, there is neither anything new nor anything original in this book.    The best advice I could find in this book was more applicable to the author than anybody else. And the advice is in the form of a quote at the end of the section 26.1.4. "It takes less time to do a thing right than to explain why you did it wrong   - H.W.Longfellow"     Dear Author, the readers deserve an explanation! 
 It's a disturbing trend that qualified scholars who are clearly not UNintelligent are playing leapfrog with sources, to produce an impression that is unsupported by genuine source material.  Unfortunately, this book is typical of many similar to its type - i.e., source material is not dated, assumptions proliferate, conclusions are drawn between one point and another as though the points' existence proved their relationship, and so on.  I hesitate to recommend this work even to those writing theses on the subject of early polytheism, as it's difficult to sort out what text actually says what and in what context, let alone supplying information on chronological reliability of sources, their dates, and so on 
 At first, I was really hyped to see this movie with the big named stars, especially Ms. Weaver. But when it was over I shouted, "I KNEW IT!" For a hard-core horror movie fan like myself, that's definitely a sign of a bad movie review to come. This movie broke my record of figuring out the plot even before the first minute was through. And the only reason why I sat through the entire movie was because I had my check book to balance, and a few crypto puzzles to complete. The Village reminded me of nothing more than a slap-shod script tossed around for a few days among amature script editors, then rushed into the credulous hands of famous stars. Not only did this movie ruin a few good careers, it also ruined my respect for those who stared in it.   Tip for the day: If someone gives you a free copy of The Village, sell it on an auction site immediately. Trust me, you won't feel guilty getting rid of it as fast as you can. You'll experience more suspense selling it to the highest bidder than having to sit through the entire movie. 
 This is the only SS video that bored my toddlers.  It bores me as well.  It's very outdated.  The one star I gave was for the Count's song I love.  Other than that - save your $$, you can find many other great SS videos out there....My fav is Rock n Roll Sesame Street.  Very clever and great songs for adults too 
 We received this microwave as a wedding present, and it really was a good microwave. The toasting function is handy and seemed to work well. It is a bit small inside, but that was OK since it's just my husband and now. Now that we've had it for 2 years, it's starting to spark while it's running and I am scared it's going to start a fire in my kitchen! I know others have had this problem, and I'm actually shocked that Sharp has not recalled this item because it really poses a fire hazard. So here's what I think: great, but doesn't work long term. And for the price, you would expect to keep it longer than 2 years. Oh, and if you decide to cook popcorn, be sure and take out the turntable and try to cook it on a bowl or in a plate. As long as the bag does not touch the top or sides, it shouldn't burn. I have had much more success with it since I started doing that 
 This book left me with a "huh; that's nice" type of feeling. In no way, shape, or form did it help me break the habit of procrastinating. Ironically, my project (this) was sent in at the last second because I.... procrastinated. The projects in the book really just show you what type of procrastinator you are, and then they just move on, not really helping you fix the problem. The book kinda suggests that you should consider doing something but I think the author procrastinated writing some of the sections, forgot about it, then came back to writing the book and moved on.. 
 This is the off-beat story of Esker, a 31 year old woman who, since her college years, has been haunted by a past relationship disappointment.  The question of the story: will she allow a man to love her again?  Interesting premise, but there are many problems with the way it was handled: the previous lover was so unloving it's difficult to empathize with the extreme loss Esker's felt in his absence;  Esker offers so little in the way of emotional connection to the new man in her life, his continued affection for her doesn't make sense; the book never delivers anything in the way of character growth or change.  Nothing happens here.  She's unhappy in the beginning.  She stays that way.  A real disappointment.  I got the sense the author was more interested in the way she used language than in what she was actually saying 
 Is this a book to help out women who suffer from being misinformed about menopause or an advertisement for progesterone cream?  Didn't help me at all, if anyone wants to buy it, it's yours but I don't recommend it 
 As the author admits, the title of her "book is a misnomer." She also confesses that "Islam in the book title is potentially misleading." Those are not the only problems with the book. The entire book itself is a "misnomer" and a conflation of Islam and Human Rights. A careful reading of the Holy Qur'an would have exposed the author to the fact that the Qur'an has all the tenets of the International Human Rights Instruments and plenty more. [We have developed a power point lecture showing the connections between these tenets.] It is not surprising that Eurocentric institutions and individuals have endorsed the book at the Westview Press Web site, without an independent review of the sources that represent Islamic thought. Then, again, any work that finds a way to bash Islam, subtlely or flagrantly, becomes fodder for Eurocentrists. As we strive to foster a Dialogue between Civilizations and peaceful relationships, a careful reading and representation of one another's thoughts become the more imperative 
 If I could give a rating less than 1 star, I would have. The book did start out well. Julien was the perfect hero so in love with the heroine. And Kate the perfect endearing heroine. But when Julien asked Sir Oliver (father) for Kate's hand in marriage, Kate got so angry at Julien and started to hate him- as in really loathe him. Isn't it but proper during that era for the man to ask permission from the father first before proposing to the woman? So why is Kate so angry? Julien tried to win her by showing her everything a woman would die for- his love, his comfort and his social standing. What more does she want? But she scorns him and hates him even more. And her hatred lasted until almost the end of the book. Truly unbelievable. How utterly boring and irritating. There was no special moment that made my heart flutter. Kate is not endearing at all. I even hate her already for being so irrational- and so stubborn. Doesn't she know how lucky she is to catch Julien??? Also, if Kate is really a troubled woman, shouldn't it show from the 1st page? She was a carefree, independent and so happy woman. Not at all the characteristic of someone who is troubled with the child abuse and the regular physical abuse of her father. I did not even finish the book. I gave it a try until the 300th page, but couldn't continue anymore for it is just a waste of my precious time. There was also no reason why Julien would rape Kate. He never even tried to be intimate with her at any point in the book. It's just so stupid. The writing style is good though- but the plot is just so bad! I can go on and on... but in the end all I want to say is- Do not waste your time and money with this book. Really- it's not romantic at all. Kate's actions will make you roll your eyes 
 This book is written well enough that one might overlook the numerous flaws in Mr. Siegel's case.  This case, while sometimes compelling, is far too often flawed.  Simplistic logic seems to be Mr. Siegel's forte - that  is, he takes things as cause and effect without offering proof of any  assocation.  He argues, for instance, that Cuomo's building of prisons  lowered the crime rate and Reagan's deregulation led to economic growth.   Proof behind either statement is lacking, as it is throughout this book.   For a history, this was also majorly flawed in that it did not identify  sources - where does Mr. Siegel get the few statistics he puts in the book?   Demonizing conservatives and liberals also seems to be Mr. Siegel's strong  suit, as this avoids the need to offer a comprehensive ideology of his own.   I did learn more about all three cities from this book but cannot be sure  how much is definitively true due to the large amounts of spin.  Worth  reading, but do so critically 
 I purchased this read because it mentioned or made reference to real life interesting women.  I believed the book would offer some factual information about the lives of these complex women that perhaps was unknown to the reader.  Information that would yield insight as to why the media has concluded or labeled, fairly or unfairly, that these particular women are "Bitches".  After reading the book in its entirety, I came to the conclusion that the author used these names to sell a book about "nothing" in order to make money.  The book is not, and has nothing to do with, any of the women mentioned or referenced in it. 
 Well-researched biography, maybe; however, I found Robb's patronizing tone towards his subject to be distasteful, offensive. A more objective account--without a lurking sneer behind it--is in order. 
 viewed it 1st was disappointed knodded my head in disbelief while watching,waiting,hoping!!!,the second time i tried to keep awake but could not keep my eyes open long enough, must of been those gravity waves in interstellar space out there in umm well you get the picture.My advise is for you to save your money and buy comos (the best imo)To be honest, i couldn't wait to sell it used at a $10 lose through amzn.the following week(they get a commission for sold items)nonetheless,i am content i no longer own it.Next time i will rent before purchasing on amzn. Just So you know, "cosmos" i can watch over and over for years as this was my first box set from amzn..the late carl sagans"cosmos" blows away "the astronomer" 
 For some reason the product was not delivered, UPS returned it.  This was send for charity.  After many emails and phone calls, the company refuses to respond or refund the money. SHipping was more than the product 
 This novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1926 (for whatever reason) which the author refused to accept (maybe he agreed with some of the reviews).  The author later won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1930.  The novel is about a fictional person growing up in a fictional state, going to a fictional university, etc.  I may get jumped on by some people for saying so, but personally I found the story dull and tedious (a good cure for insomnia).  It does not compare with other prize winning novels which I have read that were written during the same era (Pearl Buck's "The Good Earth," Booth Tarkington's "The Magnificent Ambersons," etc.).  I suppose this is one of those novels that you must read if you are a literature student, but I would not recommend it to anyone else.  If you have an interest in the author, I would suggest trying one of his other novels 
 Do any of you positive reviewer even know that "Dr." Breggin doesn't even see patients anymore? That in nearly 2 years all he has done has traveled the country to testify in courts against psychiatrists? That is, in states which haven't yet discredited him for being biased and unscientific. I find it amazing that a man who hasn't treated a psychiatrist patient in years can write a book so skewed and wrong that it can endanged the public and still be published. What bothers me more is that people think he's correct. Modern medicine does not know the reason that the pancreas produces less insulin than normal, they only know that it does, so maybe diabetics should stop taking insulin and try to figure out if they were raised improperly by their mothers. Sound crazy? Of course, but this is the message that he's advocating. He should be ashamed of himself. He is not a real doctor and should return his diploma. Edit: 12/21/05---take about misunderstanding...Karellen's comments above are typical of those attacking something they know little about, making me wonder if Karellen believes in aliens like Tom Cruise. I said nothing about when the book was written and that is irrelevant to the point of the review which is that Breggin's opinions are so biased that he has been discredited by state courts in this country. I was trying to avoid posting websites, but since you posted one I'll post one too: http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/breggin.htm 
 Flynn is half-crazy and I can't for the life of me understand how he was able to type with his arms in a strait-jacket. With a book this awful to his credit, he'd make a great White House reporter 
 I place this book on the same level as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Yes, this is a book of fiction, but its entire portrayal of the goddess Kali--widely worshipped today in India, and elsewhere around the world--and Her worshippers is not only slanderous but dishonest.  I don't for a moment believe that the author actually thinks those who worship Kali are all child-murderers, sadists, and psychopaths...but those he fictionally portrays are.    Worse, he portrays Kali as a demon.  This is comparable to writing a fiction book portraying Mohammed as a child molester or Jehovah as a sadistic voyeur.  Kali is the obvious choice, the easy one, as She combines the famous Western combination of Occidental prurience and horror at Oriental depravity.  Kali superbly fills this bill, as She is naked, black, and rules the dimension of death.    Kali is unknown to the TV-watching West save through movies like "Gunga Din" and "Indiana Jones" (the one that has the hidden temple in it).  Both of these films are based on the myth of thuggee--the Thugs--a creation of the British colonial racist imagination.  Sleeman (the Brit responsible for this bit of slander) cobbled up "evidence" with no basis other than his own hearsay and considerable store of contempt for the "wogs," and presto--you have Kali the goddess of murder.   Simmons's book is simply another thuggee story, albeit set in a modern context.  I will not dignify this trash by writing more about it 
 There should beseveral pages of information about each state to make this book educational. It is not nearly enough for a 9-12 year old to learn from.  That is why we are returning it 
 Ms. Morgenthaler obviously knows what she's talking about, but she seems to have an attitude that she's writing for a group of clueless morons whose only hope is to agree completely with her and do things her way. This poorly edited book is written in a rather sarcastic, condescending tone to the point of ridicule if anyone does not agree with her. I believe most worship leaders will have discovered for themselves through experience Ms. Morgenthaler's insights in worship planning, and her expansive passages on musical programming seem to assume her readers don't even have the musical expertise to find middle "C" on a piano. So I recommend this book if you have little formal musical training and have never led a contemporary worship service and need a crash course in worship direction. Otherwise, spend your time planning your next service 
 If you have read Life Strategies or have completed any of the exercses in the Life Strategies Workbook, then you are already on your way to self-discovery.  Both are excellent self-help tools and highly recommended.  However, this journal is not like the original book or the companion workbook and readers could be very disappointed.  There is nothing contained in this journal that would lead one to self-discovery other than what the reader actually chooses to write.  You are not prompted for ideas, thoughts or feelings but left to your own resources to express your own thoughts. There are a variety of basic journals on the market, many for more outstanding than this one, so invest your money in the Life Strategies book and the Life Strategies Workbook and pass on the Self-Discovery Journal 
 I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation "i'm your man" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of "if it be your will" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. "If It be your will" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. "mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ." or "i am so very happy, so please hit me" or "river of sorrow, don't swallow" or the breathy way he says the word "twilight" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.   Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says "if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved "if it be your will" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort. 
 My family and I love Anne of Green Gables and cried through most of it.. we do not have a problem with the first 2... but............ we have been watching the series 1.30 each week and come to the last dvd the coninuing story and boy is is the worst acted and story movie we have ever seen... I do not know what happen to Anne ( megan fellows) she was dead in every which way you look at it, no sparkal, no love no joy or happeness in her eyes or face at any time, she acted like a 50 year old women, we know she grew up but a person who has sparkle and joy and laughter in their eyes never loses that, and her voice in a few years has become deep and old.. we are so disappointed and so upset with this dvd... how can ones acting and joy be gone so fast... hel 
 This book is the "standard" for providing straightforward code demonstrating various options pricing techniques, and perhaps deservedly so -- after all, it really doesn't have too many competitors in that niche. However, even in the course of the fairly straightforward applications I've had for this book (mostly simple equity Cox-Ross and Black-Scholes modeling), I've been shocked by the number of blatant mathematical errors (in the formulas for rho with distinct carry and risk-free rates, for instance). Clearly, the author and editors didn't bother to spend much time verifying that the formulas they cite are actually correct. (I'm actually shocked to see a fellow reviewer praise the "proofreading" -- I'm guessing he or she never actually had to use any of the formulas in this book!)    Bottom line -- if you're looking for a handy, compact reference of option pricing formulas, this is probably what you'll end up with. But be careful. It is SO frustrating to spend hours trying to figure out where you made a mistake in implementing one of these models, only to learn that you DIDN'T make a mistake -- the mistake was in your source. Consider yourself warned.. 
 I am a musicain. This book is wrong. This book is perfect for people who are looking to blame the problems of society on everything but society itself(themselves). Music is a product of society, not the other way around as Tame argues. David Tame is insane! 
 Laymon has some excellent books, this is not one of them. I swear he must have repeatedly smashed his head against a wall before writing it, the IQ is so low. The Traveling Vampire Show, Island, Midnight's Lair, Body Rides.... all good stuff. Even the sub par books are better than this; blood games, among the missing etc.  This book feels like it was written by an eight grader with a constant erection and an overly violent disposition. Woman are cast in the worst light possible and all the guys are either idiotic, insane or both. The little town where this story takes place just needs to be nuked, because if anybody actually acted like the characters in this book do the human race would be gone in two generations. 
 I bought a Capresso 114.01 espresso machine via Amazon in December of 2005. I had selected it in part, because of the high "bar" pressure rating. Upon receiving it, the first shot of espresso took several minutes to make. The coffee just drips out one drop at a time. The manual suggests "using a coarser grind than other espresso machines". I tried progressively coarser grinds until I was at the coarsest setting of my burr gringer...the coffee was getting weaker, and coming out a little faster, but still taking many minutes for one shot of espresso, with a weak and bitter result and no crema. The manual suggests tamping the coffee ever so lightly. Good suggestion, because if you tamp it with more than a feather's weight of pressure, you get no coffee flow at all. I called Capresso technical support numerous times. They suggested disassembling the machine--unscrewing the metal screen on the body of the machine where the water comes through-- and cleaning it. I did this to no avail. Besides, one shouldn't need to service a machine that is less than a month old in this way! After two months of frustrating, hit-and-miss results, I returned the machine to Amazon. Because it's after the 30 day return period, I may not get a full refund, but I'm glad to be rid of that piece of junk. I have since purchased a $180 Krups XP 4000 espresso machine that just works beautifully, with any grind of coffee (even very fine), any tamping pressure (even quite firm), the machine produces 2 shots of espresso in 25 seconds flat with tons of crema. What a relief 
 I often ponder the meaning of life.  I often consider what experiences I might accomplish over the course of my life.  And I also consider those experiences I hope not to accomplish.  Certainly, I wish reading Locke's essay had been on the latter list.  This book is an exhibition of human wastelandism.  If your hope is to become truly stupider, I suggest you read this breakthrough in stupidity and worthless Babel.  And then eat the book.  And then vomit the book up, and burn the book/vomit.  And vow never to read another one of Locke's filth-bombs 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 Evelyn Waugh once described this book as 'gibberish' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page.  That said, it's quite amusing to read bits from 
 Unbearably pretentious.  In a failed attempt by the author to appear intellectual, the book is poorly written and at time incoherent 
 I got hooked on Tiesto about 5 years ago. Heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album. Neverhteless, it wasn't but it was still tiesto though right? Well...the hits on this CD are about 5 years old. The build ups are terrible and I felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists. Stick with "Tiesto:Nyana" ...10130340345435 times better 
   I have never written an online reveiw and never intended too, but this film was so terrible, brutal and boring (which is an amazing combination in itself) that as a service to other people who enjoyed this directors later film "spring, summer, fall, winter...and spring" I felt compelled to issue this warning.     This is perhaps the worst film I have seen in years.  In this film you will see the following: several live fish caught, thrown onto a dock and hacked to pieces with a knife as the flop around, a bird drown in its cage, a woman insert fish hooks into her vagina and yank on the fish line to set them in, a man deficate (shot up from below so you miss nothing) another fish thrown on the floor and having battery cables attached, a dog beaten, women slapped and degrated, and a frog having his brains bashed in as he is slammed against a rock and then skinned.    And in spite of all this sadistic stuff going on, I was bored. This is truly a piece of crap. I will not even address the plot as it is already reveiwed many time. But if you are looking for horror, look elsewhere, every death, man and animal, is shot in a slow drawn out distant way. Not scary.   Is there nudity and sex, yes shot in the same ditracted slow boing way.   I am not sayiny that this movie isn't making some kind of statement, just that the statement is brutal and slow and shallow.   Oh and I forgot to mention the fish that is cut into sushi and eaten while alive, but not enough to kill it, and then allowed to swim away with huge gashes of flesh missing on either side.   I am not some peta vegan liberal tree hugger but the cruelty inflicted (not FX) on the animals in this film just to try to fill up boring gaps in this boring piece of crap is disgusting.   There are better films than this to see, try "vertcal ray of the sun" for instance.   
 I would NOT recommend new writers to read this UNTIL they have finished writing their book.  While it has great advice on the publishing business, it practically discourages any one from writing at all.  It's very "left-winged" and biased.  If you don't live in New York, forget it.  The book makes you feel like you don't have any chance of ever getting published!!  Not good reference material for first time writers 
 I read this book because it won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1983.  It is, I believe, the least intersting and most esoteric book I have ever read.  It reminded me of my reading of Fin-de-Siecle Vienna, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1981, and which I long wanted to read and then when I read it I found it a chore to read, and greatly welcomed the last page.  The last chapter of Transformation made no sense for me at all, and reading this book's only significance is that I have read another Pulitzer Prize winner in history.  I thought I should warn persons who might be overly influenced by the other 3 reviews and might think this would be a great book to read 
 I bought this E&A after Glannon's E&A saved me in Civil Procedure.  Unfortunately, this topic just is not well suited to the E&A format.  For anyone looking for a little help in Con Law, I highly recommend Erwin Chemerinsky's horn book--Constitutional Law (not a terribly inventive title, but it is a great supplement) 
 This book is so appalling that I honestly do not understand why a publisher would put out something like this.  It is almost 300 pages of what looks like a power point presentation.  There is hardly a complete sentence in the entire book- just bullet points.  As a reader I am disgusted at this format and hope that this is not a sign of things to come. I simply could not "read" this book.  The presentation is terrible. There are no proper sentences, no paragraphs and therefore little in the way of intelligent analysis.  Not being illiterate I hated it because its message was impossible to decipher. Who knows what it is about -   I wish I could give it zero stars. 
 My daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time.  I even tried to put a towell to make it less steep, but it didn't work.  Worst yet, her head would slide off the edge.  I guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around 
 Dear lord, this is one of the most tedious books I have read in ages.  I generally love the Chick Lit genre, but this book is just annoying.  I find the writing boring and tedious and often quite juvenile.  The character is completely self-absorbed and a whiny...  Blech, it's really quite awful 
 Found this novel very trite and the lead character too overblown and shrill. Also as another reviewer said - what is with Jerry Mather's being gay???  I am sure that he is NOT.  Loaded with errors and mis-spellings.  I could not understand why the lead character did not want to be around her family.  Her mother did not seem like a bad person so I did not think that this was developed at all.  This novel could have been alot better and I am not going to read any of her other books.  Too many good southern writers to read instead of reading Ms. Smith's. Read Cathy Holton's novel instead - wonderful southern women's novel 
 "1066 and all that..." being the stock British phrase for the Norman Conquest, this book should have been titled "All That."  You slog through so much extraneous, badly organized material (including Saxon and Scandinavian names)that it makes the stereotypical Russian novel look like a model of clarity.  Up to about page 100 there's the occasional paragraph pointing out which way we're going and after that, golly, sometimes a whole page or two of clear storyline. There's actually some interesting stuff but 11th century history and politics were a mess and this book doesn't do much to clear things up 
 I have studied many aspects of financial and management accounting, management issues, etc. from introductory to advanced levels. I have never used such an unappealing book. The student must sift through much wordiness. There are few, and sometimes no examples of the various calculations. There is very little use of white space. Virtually no colour, no use of bullets. Not only is the material presented in a "dry" form, but the book is not pretty to look at. The most praise I can give this book is that it is not too heavy to carry, and it has a pretty blue cover 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
   This book is an embarrassment.  It is cheap for a reason: This little book is all of 96 pages long, including the introduction.  The best edition of Sun Tzu is the Special Edition that contains two English versions; one simple version, like this one without commentary or notes and another version that the complete, fully documented Giles's Edition and, in addition, it has the text in Chinese Characters.  If you are going to spend the time and effort to read and understand Sun Tzu, you may as well spend a few dollars more and have a book that is worth the money.    
 This was a well written book, and one I might have enjoyed......if I knew I was reading a secular novel.  I thought I was reading christian fiction, and waited thru almost the entire book for the christian message to shine thru.  I realized almost at the end of the book that was not going to happen. I had no reason to expect otherwise, as she has previously written christian fiction and I got it off the christian fiction shelf at the library.  I'm very glad I didn't pay for this book as I wouldn't have received what I thought I was paying for 
 The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others 
 Hes upset of successful people because they can use their subconscious for success but unlike martee/druggie tell amazon.com to delete him.Buy this dvd if you like 2 pac, i don`t like this dvd much but i respect the fact he used his spiritual subconscious for real success 
 I recently read Robert Monroe's first book, "Journeys Out of Body" and found it to be a disappointment - it was just weird. As I noted in my review of that book, I had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound, for which he is allegedly noted. As I purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read, I thought I'd give it a try.   The book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his "research" and I thought that, perhaps, this book might actually have some real substance. That belief; however, quickly disappeared. By the time I had reached the half-way point in the book, nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish. How does total garbage like this manage to get printed?!  There are those that claim that Monroe was a highly left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right-brain. If this book is any indication, one can't help but wonder if Monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere! There is nothing logical or, for that matter, even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book. It would have been worthwhile if Monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner. Instead, he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own, personal, dream experiences: these wander so aimlessly, from paragraph to paragraph, that one can't help but wonder what real point, if any, he was trying to make.  The really sad thing is that I had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - I was actually quite interested in the topic. Having now been subjected to two of his useless books, I'm amazed that they're still in print. This is pseudo-science at its absolute worst. 
 This book started off good, and I really liked the way it was written - focusing on a bunch of different characters one by one and seeing what they were up to at that moment in conjunction with the plot.  So that was cool.  As the book went on, though, I began to get a little annoyed.  Am I supposed to believe that after one great day, two strangers can think of nothing but each other and are going to such great lengths because they've both fallen in love with each other?  I wish they'd either been together a little more at the beginning or at the end, as I didn't really feel any chemistry between them.  It was an OK book overall - although the ending seemed rushed and I wish I could have known what happened after that, it wasn't very satisfying for me - but I'm rather disappointed that I bought this book at full price and am now stuck with it, since I'll probably never reread it.  I'd recommend this to you only if you buy it at a used bookstore or check it out from the library and aren't expecting the best book in the world.  Maybe if I'd set my expectations lower, I would have enjoying it more.  :- 
 I really enjoyed the TV show but this book is soooo boring!  It is chapter after chapter of exceedingly dull anecdotes.  Do you really want to know what each person ordered at dinner?  I know I don't.  Each chapter ends with an "informative" list like Brian's top 5 favorite hot dogs.  Gimme a break.  Don't waste your money on this book 
 This book was horrible! I love Kathy Reichs she is my favorite author. But Max Collins destroyed her character. The book is slow and the characters are one dimensional. Kathy Reichs should have never shared her success with Max Collins he did her no justice. This book is as lame as the show-- save your money 
 A slow, loggy movie about a philandering husband (everyone was guessing this was Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein in the Nora Ephron novel on which the movie is based; he was Ephron's husband). Jack Nicholson plays the husband and Meryl Streep the wife, and both are uncharacteristically bland. There is hardly anything to the story: they marry, she gets pregnant, he gets restless and wanders. We finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started. Very dull 
 "Ha ha ha hah ha hah!"  That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  Or at least I hope that's what he is doing.  But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  Quick!  Stop me!  I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  The genre requires we make a leap of faith.  And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly.  But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this "Tolkein as faith" drivel.  But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the "thanks for the buck buddy" and is himself laughing at us all.  But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense!  My recommendation?  Read the book.  Laugh a bit.  Maybe laugh a lot. But do this with the library's copy, not one you paid for 
 I've been robbed.  I just spent $25 for this hard cover book, and now that I finished it - I feel like burning it! I feel like the authors have jerked me around, led me along so I spent my hard earned money on their three goldarned books - and for what?  Let me explain. When you start an alternative history book on any  era, you begin with a question.  "What would have happened if something had gone differently"  . Here the authors are free to pick from the hundreds of critical events and make a point of departure.  The authors choose a very interesting one. What if Lee have listened to Longstreets advice and made a massive flanking movement to the South at Gettysburg.  The first book of this trilogy covered these fictional events with not only a truely outstanding depth of knowlege of the era, but a breathtaking mastery of suspence and pacing. This was an adventure novel of the first water. A real page-turner with such detail that you felt you were present at actual events depicted in the book. Staying well within the bounds of the possible, it was utterly convincing - even to the knowledgeable reader.  The second novel was not quite as good as the first but it still had fire and held our interest well.  The end of the second novel left the Confederacy in possession of Baltimore - America's third largest city - with a large population (which about half were sympathitic to the Southern cause)and loaded with heavy industry and the technical craftsmen that the South so desperately needed. There was a major diplomatic initutive that won the French over to extending recognition to the Confederacy - there is even some exposition on the French Emperor deciding to dispatch not only troops but state-of-the-art sea going iron clad warships from the French Navy to aid the Confederates (and secure a firmer foot hold in Mexico, naturalmont).  There was an extensive dialogue with a leading Jewish intelectual in Baltimore where some broad hints were dropped about possible last ditch efforts to arm some of the Souths blacks to refil the depleated Confederate ranks.  The second novel ends August 22, 1963. We are left with all these interesting possibilities. All these interesting avenues for the alternate history author to explore.  I bought the third novel and rushed home to read it. As I turned the pages a growing sense of dread filled me - the authors were rushing things, closing off Confederate hopes with such obvious heavy handed partiallity.   You always see this near the end of a cheap potboiler - the bad guys, who have previously been masterful and clever, quite suddenly become increadibly stupid and make mistake after mistake, while the good guys, who have struggled all the way through the book to put two and two together, are suddenly geniuses and have ever possible break falls their way.  So it was with this book. You have a stupid and drunken Southerner assigned to oversee the vitally stategic B&O railroad main yard. The crafty (and openly partison to the North) yard superintendant not only delays critical Southen supplies and troop movements, he orchestrates a major campaign of sabotage and even sends one of his men to inform the Union forces of these  critical Confederate plans - all without getting caught or even suspected by those dim wit southerners.  You could tell it was all a set up from there, the sense of credibility is gone. Everything and I mean everything goes wrong for those darn rebels. Once the authors partisonship is out in the open, it is clear that history will be repeating itself here.  The third book ends with the South's ignoble defeat- now note this carefully - Lee surrenders on August 30, 1863.   THIS IS ONLY EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND NOVEL ! You get what I mean by the authors rushing things. And that, friends, is not only straining credibility, it throws it to the winds.   To use one typical example - the Noble Army of the Potomic which after its smashing defeat at Gettysburg took a full month to recover, somehow after an even more devistating defeat is able to rest, reorganize, resupply and move into position to attack Baltimore with 15,000 troops - after just 9 days - yea, right.   The pathetic Confederates, somehow have not managed to make any improvements to Baltimore's existing fortificatins, can not seem to even delay a daylight amphibious landing, nor do they fight house to house nor deploy mobile artillery to delay the advance. On the other hand, the dashing Union calvalry, storms into Frederick, and in 3 hours whips up a bomb train to take out a stone bridge, while the stupid Confederates, who have been in full possession of Baltamore for a month, can not round up enough gunpowder to blow up a similar bridge. Thus Baltimore not only falls with hardly a shot, the entire infrastructure is intact!!??!!. Wow, what a break for the good guys ;-)   This third book is a not just a total disapointment - it is a rip-off. Having raised all these interesting ideas and giving the South two absolutely smashing (if hard faught) victories - the authors whip out the climax - the totally collapse of the Southern armies like a cheap tent in just one week.  In case anyone has forgotten, even without those smashing victories and the possession of the critical city of Baltimore, the South managed to fight on - dispite General Grants best efforts until 1865 !  This book was a cruel disappointment. There was no follow up of all the interesting ideas raised in the second book. It seems like the authors lost interest and just slapped together a jury rigged ending to please the house.  Yep - the good guys won, (yawn).  One had hoped for more courage and intelectual honesty from the authors 
 I liked the other Eisenstein movies that I've watched.  Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American.  Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood.  So I thought I would give this one a try.  I really wanted to like this movie.  It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick.  I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop).  Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it.  Way too thick for me 
 I just returned this book because I hated it.  Ugh, what a series of cheesy, pretentious remarks!  Couldn't stand from the beginning 'cos it's so boring, but esp. when I got to the point where the author began talking about some psychological issues, e.g. childhood abuses, etc., as if it's nothing.  For someone like this author, who were lucky enough to have no such experience, it may seem like a lame excuse.  I'd say it's absolutely insensitive, better shut up if you don't know much about it.  If you find this book helpful or encouraging, I guess you weren't that bad to begin with, then better off reading much worth-reading books than wasting your time with this superficial self-promotional success story book.  
 This story had a lot of negative energy.  There could have been a better way of telling this story.  You Know Better was poorly written and boring.  It takes you way to the very end to get to the good part which really wasn't. Though I got the message.  This is just an opinon. You might like it 
 I am VERY disappointed with this product.  It is not powerful enought to remove the wrinkles from clothing.  The only way I found to get it to do a fairly decent job is to stretch the piece of clothing downward as it hangs, and rub the fabric with the brush on the steamer while steaming, going over and over the same spot.  It's like trying to iron vertically, only with no support behind the article of clothing.  It doesn't remove wrinkles nearly as well as an iron, especially if there are any unwanted creases, and it takes considerably longer than ironing, since you have to steam the same spot over and over again.  I bought the steamer because it uses tap water, and distilled water is a hastle to find when travelling, but tap water eventually causes irons to leave mineral deposits on clothing.   Instead of this product, I recommend a standard iron or travel iron.  It's easier to travel with a travel iron and just use a spray bottle filled with tap water to mist the clothes if you don't have distilled water to fill the iron with.  The Conair GS15 Hand Held Fabric Steamer is a waste of money that doesn't do its job 
 I grew up in one of the neighborhoods portrayed in this book, and while I believe the author has accurately described Jessica, Coco and their friends and relatives, these people are not representative of everyone who lives in the South Bronx. There are many, many people in these neighborhoods who shun the drug-dealing and thug lifestyle. These people work hard at low paying jobs (think doormen, porters, mailroom clerks, cashiers) and scrimp and save to send their children to Catholic school. They don't hang out on street corners and they don't allow their children to do so either. And they are the victims of people like Boy George and Cesar, they are the ones whose apartments are robbed, whose children are beaten on the way home from school, whose daughters are harassed.   I hate the idea that middle-class white liberals are reading this book and getting some kind of voyeuristic thrill. I suspect they wouldn't be nearly as enthralled by a book that chronicled the lives of the people I've described above, the ones who try to live upstanding lives despite overwhelming poverty and the threats of the street. 
 This is the worst children's book I've ever read. I am a teacher and have quite a range of knowledge of children's books. There is no moral to this story. The story starts out very pleasant and then there are 3 robbers with knives and guns. As if that isn't bad enough, they even hold the gun to Pearl's head!! There are 3 different scenes with them ~ it doesn't make sense. Then a Fox comes along and leads her to an abandoned house - With beer bottles on the front lawn!! It is truly an awful book. I teach High School English 3 and discussed the book with my students, some of whom are parents ~ they even agreed that it's not a book for children! 
      Compared to Kimmel's brilliant first novel,"Solace..."  this reads like a labored Writing Class assignment: "Write a piece about a woman pool hustler, and make her an angry, masculine, drywaller whose redneck mother alludes to Kundera, Randall Jarrell, Marianne Moore, Anne Sexton, Martin Amis in the space of 2 pages."        Kimmel has a thing about frustrated intellectual housewives (the mothers, Laura, here and Annalee in "Solace...") who never went to college yet worship at the alter of Thought and Literature.  Usually one kid goes to Bloomington to become a neurotic pointy-head while the other makes meth in the barn or practices tire-iron road rage while Seeking The Absent Father.  Throw in some depth psychology and pages of pointless and unbelievable STRIFE, and you eventually get to the end of the exercise.        The pasted-on New Orleans Good Ending is OK only because we can hope that Hurricane Katrina has wiped out Haven's fictional Pool Hall Heaven paid for by deus ex machina.  By the way, Cassie, the lumpy heroine whose outlawry consists of having uninteresting pot-smoking friends and never paying income tax, supposedly inherits a $300G stock and insurance settlement and the lawyer hands it over in cash and takes out no taxes?       Haven needs to have people who aren't in awe of her to read the drafts of her future novels. She is way too talented to wing it just because she had a great first novel. She needs better advisors/editors 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 I love sci fi and hate this movie.  When I mean I love sci fi, I will accept plot flaws to a good premise or special effects.  This movie, has no plot and no premise.  The special affects are good, but not enough to call the movie even remotely enjoyable.  Complete dissapointment. my 2 cents 
 I bought this book because I had read several enthusiastic reviews.  It started out as a fast, fun read, but quickly became tiresome and repetitive, and then just plain annoying.  Volkman forces history into a standard template: a political entity has a military problem and solves it by applying science, which is done by creating an R&D operation in which scientists abandon "pure" science to create deadly weapons.  The same template is applied to everyone from the ancient Assyrians and modern states.  History is grossly oversimplied and some events (e.g., the Battle of Agincourt) are warped beyond recognition to fit nicely into Volkman's thesis.  The book's abstract is highly misleading: the book does not "examine": (1) "the moral dilemmas" - it basically *asserts* (at virtually every juncture) that scientists prostitute themselves when they work on weapons.  The last 25-30% could largely be retitled "scientists as war criminals". (2) "knotty technological problems" - its treatment is only somewhat better than you would encounter in a bland public high school history book.  Too often, solutions seem to just magically appear. (3) "pragmatic necessities ..." - ditto.  The first five chapters have a fast-paced, enthusiastic style and might be useful for piquing a student's interest into looking more deeply into some of the topics here.  However, for anyone who already has even a modest background in this area, this book offers little or nothing in the way of insights or alternate perspectives 
 Not a bad read...but not a factual one either. The movie nor the book provide the reality of the Jean Michel Basquiat story. Enjoy it as gossip filled fiction literature 
 I read this book quickly and probably won't use it again before we remodel the kitchen.  This is the fifth book I've read on kitchens and I purchased this one based on the reviews here.  Like another reviewer said, this book is a handy companion if you are needing some design ideas and plan on working with a designer in the future.  I guess I was expecting more substance.  The authors try really hard to be funny. They are also assuming their audience is female.  I didn't enjoy this approach and found the writing boorish.  There are some useful things in the book, but these things are far and few between.    My favorite book so far is "Great Kitchens: Design Ideas from America's Top Chefs".   
 I bought this DVD a while back from Amazon. I was very disappointed with the dvd. It's a joke!,really. He was worse than the beginner dancer. I watched the DVD for about 5 minutes and it made me sick thinking that I paid for this?. I will not accept this if someone give it to me for FREE. If you're serious in learning salsa, the New York Salsa DVD series are very good. Don't waste your money on this one! 
 I'm sure it would work well somewhere, just not for our small business.  I put it behind an ADSL router and used it to authenticate PPPoE.  It was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was, it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected. After hours on the phone with tech support from Linksys and the DSL Router people, nobody could help.  While it connected, it did work very well, it just did stay up.  Too Bad 
 This book is unbelievable in that it takes seriously the demented ravings of a very mentally ill woman (Anna Anderson) and her equally disturbed husband, John Manahan. The book is completely biased and one-sided in favor of Anderson's claim that she is Grand Duchess Anastasia. The author treats his subject with deference and reverence, even when she is acting like a madwoman, which is most of the time. In a restaurant, Anderson demands coffee: "I want coffee!". Her poor, long-suffering husband gently tells her she can't have coffee , if she does she will be up all night. "I want coffee"! she shrieks, like a spoiled child. The author Lovell, says to Manahan, if the Grand Duchess wants coffee, then coffee she will have. He is quite in thrall to the bizarre woman he believes is royalty He believes her claim that the Grand Duchesses, their mother Alexandra, and their father Nicolas, were gang-raped. He believes there was a secret FIFTH Romanov daughter. He believes that Anna Anderson is Anastasia, and that anyone who thinks she is not is involved in a vast conspiracy to retain political power and gain access to the Romanov millions which are secreted away in some bank, somewhere. Lovell reminds me of people who insist that Bigfoot exists, that Elvis is alive, that a sea-monster lives in Loch Ness. There is no proof of any of that. Just as that there is no actual PROOF that Anna Anderson was Anastasia. There never was. You had to take her story on faith. That's all her followers can really offer in the way of proving she was of royal birth; faith. Here's something else that is disturbing about this book, and the other Anastasia book by Peter Kurth (also a devout believer in Anderson); Anderson and Manahan are portrayed in both books as harmless eccentrics, when in fact they were both dangerously mentally-ill. They both were what is known today as "hoarders"; their home and property was a health hazard due to the immense piles of junk and garbage they had accumulated. Anderson was a hoarder of ANIMALS; she had dozens of cats, and when one died she would cremate it in the fireplace. These two needed to be committed to a mental institution, but due to Manahan's money they occasionally would be given a warning to clean up the property or else, and that would be the end of it. Their property would be cleaned up a bit, then go right back to where it was. Anderson and Manahan were quite simply, two unbearable, insufferable people who were both paranoid and irrational. Both this book and Peter Kurth's "Anastasia; The Riddle of Anna Anderson" attempt to throw a smoke screen over the reader's eyes as to the reality of what Anderson really was. But the evidence can't be refuted. Anderson could never PROVE she was Anastasis. But the DNA evidence PROVED that she wasn't. Case closed. End of "fairy tale" 
 I read this a few years back, but I still remember it well for being the first book I couldn't bring myself to finish. I read about 100 pages, which took me over a month, after which I sat down and pondered whether the plot or characters actually justified going on reading. The book had its moments, but I found it to lack direction.  The language is absolutely excruciating. Some sentences are almost a page long, and just littered with commas, parentheses, strange use of colons, or all of the above. Often a sentence could begin with a story of something, then trailing off to a sub-story of that item, then trailing off to a sub-sub-story of the sub-story before going back to the sub-story, maybe to another sub-sub-story and back to the sub-story, and finally back again to the story where the sentence started. When you constantly have to go back half a page to remind yourself how the damn sentence STARTED, it's more frustrating than fun to read. I suppose Faulkner was going for some stream-of-consciousness approach, which I can safely say is not my cup of Scotch.  I should point out that I am an experienced reader and that I read it in my native tongue. Maybe the translator did a hack job, I have no idea. I only know it was a thoroughly painful read and I felt relieved to ditch it and move on. A book is NOT well written just because it's "difficult".  Of course, he won the Nobel prize, so what do I know 
 Sheila Fitzpatrick has written that the total number of those murdered by the Soviets is in the "low hundreds of thousands."  In other words, she is a crank. There are numerous books out debunking Fitzpatrick and her fellow apologists for Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Yale University's "Annals of Communism" series is a good place to start.   "In Denial: Historians, Communism & Espionage" by John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr is an excellent read on how Fitzpatrick and other academics distort facts and lie through omission to cover up the atrocities of Lenin, Zinoviev, Radek, Trotsky, Stalin et al.   Fifteen years ago, Fitzpatrick's apologies for a regime which murdered over 20 million of its own citizens could have been (weakly) defended. Now that the Soviet archives have been opened and we have testimony from those involved in the regime, her book is simply inexusable.   Read "A Century of Violence in Soviet Russia"  by Alexander N. Yakovlev and Anthony Austin.  Yakovlev was the architect of perestroika. He was a communist. He had access to documents western researchers have not yet seen. Yakovlev details how the regime was a criminal organization from its founding. It never had the support Fitzpatrick claims it did.       
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 In answer to DesertFlower's question as to whether the Anime or the Manga came first, the answer is that the Manga was done as an adaptation of the Anime series -- in other words, the Anime was first.  I read somewhere that the manga artist(s) saw the animated version of Darcia and "couldn't wait" to draw him in the Manga, so there's a bit of provenance for you.  I agree with other posters here that an up-market, high-quality Manga treatment of "Wolf's Rain" would've done the material far more justice than the current Manga release, and would've wound up in the hands of far more consumers/fans than this current Manga edition, of which I've read nothing but horrible reviews here and elsewhere since I've been looking.  Since Bandai's box-set is only being released as of November 22nd this year (2005), perhaps Viz and Bandai and Bones and the various licensing/legal arms of all concerned could stop for a moment and realize that people expect to see all the same beauty, blood, sweat, tears and...soul...poured into the Anime to also be evident in any printed treatment.  "Wolf's Rain" deserves that.  We deserve that. You deserve that.  Do it while it's all still fresh 
 Road Trip - USA returns you a time when America was much, much slower paced. I purchased this book because I am interested in motorcycling some of these roads in the near future. Preferable, U.S.-50. A well written book that touches on the main points of interest across, and up and down America.I am looking forward to traveling some of these roads 
 This book de-evolves into a manifesto of what Greeley would like to see in the next Pope. It's almost the author's fantasy scenario about extreme liberalism coming to dominance in the Catholic Church, right down to a Spanish Pope who wears business suits and who used to be a married husband and father. This far-fetched novel has so little material on which to construct a plot that Greeley concocts a love story around his Papal election politics. There is a reconciliation of a married couple on the outs, and a half-hearted aside into a secondary plotline about a man who wants to murder the next Pope. Oh, and Father Greeley drags his favorite Chicago Cardinal into the book to fill more pages and gives the poor old man a life and death personal crisis. This soap opera could have been a good short story but it's a dismal novel. Virgin And Martyr and Angels of September are better books by Andrew Greeley, and a few of the Blackie Ryan mysteries are fun, but White Smoke is a clunker 
 Having been an avid and exclusive user of the VideoHound Golden Movie Retriever (GMR) since 1996, I had high expectations of this DVD review guide sporting the VideoHound moniker. Unfortunately, many of the qualities I'd come to appreciate in the venerable Hound are largely lacking in this DVD guide - most notably, a sense of objectivity... First, it should be pointed out that each entry in this guide is comprised of two reviews: a review of the movie and a review of technical qualities of the DVD. As far as the technical DVD reviews are concerned, the editor(s) confesses in the one of the introductory chapters: "It would be wonderful if all of us - reviewers and readers - could have state-of-the-art 'reference' systems... But that's not the case, and so we don't presume to make definitive judgements."  The problem is, one *must* have reference quality equipment to properly review DVDs.  Otherwise, why bother going to the trouble of "reviewing" the technical aspects of each disc if the unknown quality of the reviewer's equipment is going to cast a questionable shadow on each review?  That said, one good thing I can say about the technical aspects of the reviews in this guide is that each review list all of the special features of each disc, as well as the aspect ratio, the packaging format (i.e., snap case, keep case, jewel case etc.), the list price and so on.  Most useful were the reviewers' comments on the cast/crew commentary tracks included on many DVDs, which seemed to be less biased than the reviewers' comments on the movies themselves.   As for bias, the actual movie reviews presented in this DVD Guide were what was most disappointing to me.  One of the advantages of the classic VideoHound GMR is that there are many contributors, a practice which seems to engender balanced, fair reviews.  Although this guide also features contributions from several reviewers (the vast majority, however, being handled by editor Mayo and chief contributor Jim Olenski), I noticed a very odd and disconcerting practice that was employed numerous times: that of taking a film review from the classic VideoHound GMR and changing a couple of words here and there to support a newly altered rating (changing the 'spin' if you will); or else, incredibly, changing the rating without changing a word of the review.  In a few cases, the movie was completely re-reviewed, and a different "verdict" passed on its merits, which would be fine except that we now have two inconsistent reviews of the same movie, both of which are apparently advocated by The Hound.  Also, when an oddball euro-cult flick such as 'Lisa and the Devil' (originally dismissed with a "woof" by the GMR, which was perhaps a bit extreme) is suddenly bestowed a "four-bone" rating (a Masterpiece!) by the reviewer; or conversely, a moderately successful, more well-received movie such as 'Mystery Men' is given a "woof" (the actual VideoHound GMR gives it a more fair rating of 2-1/2 bones) - one tends to become wary of excessive bias in the reviewer.  It goes beyond one person's opinion of this or that movie: a reviewer should try to put aside their likes and dislikes and concentrate on the movie's objective merits and demerits.  Having used this VideoHound DVD guide now for about eight months, this annoying tendency towards subjective bias is something that is seen to come through in the reviews all too frequently.  So my advice is: For good and fair movie reviews, buy the latest VideoHound Golden Movie Retriever instead.  For good technical DVD reviews, try the Widescreen Review 
 As a big fan of 70's Krautrock, I've been intrigued by the buzz surrounding Neu! in hipster circles these days.  They seem to enjoy a higher standing than excellent bands like Can, Popol Vuh and Kraftwerk, and my excitement increased when the cashier at the hip, indie-type record store practically gushed over my brilliant selection.  So I rushed home to listen to it and.....was completely underwhelmed to say the least.  This band has quite the cult following, who I'm sure will be hitting that "unhelpful" button, but I'm sorry.  I gotta call 'em the way I hear 'em.  The entire second half of this record consists of the band taking two (rather mediocre) songs and then playing them at the wrong speeds like little kids playing with their parents' stereo.  That's right, they actually recorded the songs being played at 16 rpm or 78 rpm or whatever, and expected people to both pay for and be entertained by it.  To me it's "experimentalism" at it's most pretentious and annoying (not to mention lazy-how about just writing some songs or something?)  The opening "Fur Immer" is actually a very nice encapsulation of the Krautrock sound, as Neu! lays down some interesting synth and guitar textures over a driving beat.  Unfortunately, the bass player's decision to play exactly one note throughout wears thin about halfway through the eleven minute running time.  "Lila Engel" is instructive as an influence on the post-rock movement.  Play this for any Mogwai fan and they'll instantly recognize the musical language.  Maybe I just picked the wrong introduction to the band.  Maybe Neu! and Neu 75 are better, but after blowing sixteen bucks on this one I'm not sure I'm in a hurry to find out 
 Empty Fortress by Bruno Bettelheim was just another example of the ways in with Bettelheim fabricated evidence, to further his own view that autism is the result of a Freudian 'wish this child was dead' belief at the conscious or unconscious level.  It should also be remembered that he produced this book to justiy his lack of reports on the progress of a project he had been paid an enormous amount of money to undertake.   Nature versus the environment; a valid debate in any area of human science, but this manifestly corrupt contribution is of historical value in much the same way that a fake Da Vinci is.  Looks good, until you scratch the surface, with anything like decency or common sense. 
 Although there are some great recipes in the book, too many of them do not give the English names for the ingredients and you'd have to be in Mexico, or close to the border, to be able to find many of them 
 I've now returned two of these for the same problem - a terrible screeching sound.  The first unit did it constantly and the second did it intermitently, especially between songs.  One unit is a quality problem.  Two units is a design problem 
 To be fair there are a few good ideas but by and large - this is not a good book.   In addition - this book's attitude that 2nd time brides really should focus on tiny small weddings that no one will notice.  Bridal Bargains is much better and gives practical information. 
 I really wanted to like this book because I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Peters and Lynda Robinson and am always looking for more mysteries based in Egypt. But Haney just isn't a good enough or sophistsicated enough writer to pull this off and I found the book much too long and tedious. Her descriptions were so overly-written as to be confusing. Lt. Bak is too undeveloped to be a compelling main character - all he seems to do is worry and I had a picture of him throughout wringing his linen hankie and frowning. Her dialogue is in places laughable - I doubt even the ancient Egyptians spoke in metaphores and similes or used the purple prose Haney puts in their mouths.  Haney shows herself to be an amateur fiction writer by assigning action to body parts, which unfortunately is also one of my pet peeves. Yet there were so many eyes darting, glancing, gazing steering, taking on a life of their own I sometimes thought I was in the middle of an occular replacement convention. Where did Haney and her editor learn the basics of decent fiction writing? Haney's plot development is ponderous and the outcome is obvious early on. The motivation behind the murder bordered in my opinion on the juvenile. Haney makes a major faux pas - I won't say what it is because I don't want to spoil the book for anyone else but it's something no author should ever, ever do unless it is absolutely necessary. And in this case, it wasn't. If you want to read this book, get it from the library. Sorry, I don't usually write such harsh reviews but this is one author I can honestly say I won't read again 
 All I can say is pass me some aspirin. This is a dozy of a bad novel. As it says on the dust jacket, a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased. Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.  And that's only the start of the plot.   Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well. 
 I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops.   First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling "Police, you're under arrest."  They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort.   Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too?   Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough.   By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too 
 Midway is our Navy's greatest victory, won against overwhelming odds and a battle-tested and hardened foe with superior aircraft. However Kernan considers our handling of the battle to be atrocious and holds many of the men who fought there and the Navy in disdain.  The press release states, "Alvin Kernan, who was present at the battle, has written a troubling but persuasive analysis of...aspects of this great battle, that it is a story of avoidable mistakes and flawed planning, revealing enormous failures". From this one would presume we lost at Midway.  The promotional material offers up he was there and he was there - as an enlisted flight crewman.      The underlying theme of the book is incompetence and it is implied the navy was made up of drunkards, buffoons or arrogant Academy types. Never mind that these same "buffoons" took on and defeated the greatest carrier force assembled in history and reversed the course of the war in the Pacific. Even worse is his carelessness with facts. The author states at Leyte Gulf the Japanese managed to get several escort carriers in their sights but were driven off.  This spurious treatment of facts ignores that TF Taffy 3 was comprised of 6 carriers, where one escort carrier, two destroyers and one destroyer escort were sunk in a desperate running gun battle. He states the Yamoto had 18 inch guns when they were 18.1" as well as getting the Yamoto's weight wrong by thousand of tons.  If you can't get the easy facts correct, it casts doubts on your credibility.   It is too bad for there are some superior areas like his analysis of the flawed carriers constructed due to holding down costs with the Depression.  This same construction would prove to be a fatal flaw. His analysis of the flaws of the Mark 13 torpedo and torpedo doctrine are telling. He misses the point why the Navy did not do more practice with the torpedoes since budgets were so tight because of the Great Depression.   The American Navy knew after the Coral Sea that the TBD was outclassed by the Japanese Zero.  The author does not grasp that you often go to war with what you got - such as us having unarmored HMMWV's for Iraq. When he complains of our doctrine that led to the slaughter of the torpedo squadrons, he implies Japanese tactics were better.  Kido Butai (their carrier strike force)  doctrine was launch a simultaneous strike from all carriers (mass) that was to arrive simultaneously.  Good in use of the principle of mass but inflexible and took longer to launch a strike - that led to their destruction at Midway. The friction of war caused our strike to go awry.    With an editor and a military historian to look at his writing and assertions with a critical eye, this could have been a great addition.  As it is, the book offers some interesting insights in training and the torpedo squadrons specifically but promises more than it delivers.  
 Why do we think that girls won't learn history unless it is spoon-fed to them in People Magazine form?  This book proceeds on the outlandish assumption that the 13-year-old daughter of Paul Revere had a crush on leader of the Revolution Joseph Warren, 20 years her senior, and was angry at him because she thought he had a crush on her step-mother, Paul Revere's wife.  While there's no historical basis for any of this, most of the book is taken up with the daughter's inability to tell Warren that she's sorry for treating him badly, with a few actual facts thrown in.  While Paul Revere's story is one of the most exciting of the Revolution -- and in fact there's an argument there would have been no Revolution without him -- you won't learn much about it from this book unless you already know the facts and can pick up on some elliptical references.  What's worse, you come out of it having no idea whether any particular "fact" you just read has any historical basis.  A much better choice is "In Their Own Words: Paul Revere," by George Sullivan, real history, and easy to read 
 I did not like this book. The organization was abysmal, and I decided to sell it back to the college bookstore for use by future hapless students, because it is not good as a reference guide.  I did not like how the author seemed to gear the book to an audience that is terrified of their computers or anything dealing with *gasp* math 
 The book has a certain zany energy to it, but the plot is inane and the writing is incredibly corny.  I couldn't even listen to it as an audio book.  If you're interested in the Japanese underworld read Barry Eisler's John Rain series instead 
 I was surprised how shockingly dull this book was compared to his "Gates of Fire."  This is a book desperately searching for a plot.  One can get a better picture of Alcibiades reading a "traditional" history (Donald Kagan's "The Peloponnesian War" is highly recommended).  Read "Gates of Fire" or "The Last Amazon" instead.  You will be disappointed if you buy this book 
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
 i feel as a korn fan of 11 years i can write a decent review of opinion. please note that that is exactly what this is. an OPINION.  This album sorely disappointed me from start to end. I didnt like one song at all. I am going to stand up and say NO, ITS NOT BECAUSE HEAD LEFT. Its one of FIVE guys. Brian had absolutely no affect on David being lazy and uncreative with his drumming. Fieldy started playing normal of his own free will im sure. Munky, i hope to god you find some more inspiration than you did this round. The guitar playing is so boring. and jonathan, i really didnt dig what he tried to do this album. the moment i heard "because no one understands you, but the music do.." they lost me. I do not like this new attempt one bit. Even the artwork sucks. and so do the onstage people in outfits remaking it.  HOWEVER---- please note, that if you were an old fan but dislike the new cd, the bonus track "It's Me Again" is actually quite decent. Much like something that was scrapped from the "Take A Look In The Mirror" sessions. Not perfect, but i put it in rotation for myself 
 I bought this in November and used it a couple times. It worked on one disk and not the other. I went to use it again and it stopped working. I then called Maxell and it only has a 90 warranty. So I am feeling ripped off and angry. Oh well, that'll teach me to buy Maxell anything 
 This book is an attempt to describe the emotional process of selling by evaluating the motivating factors which affect your selling abilities.  However, it is a combination of every sales program you have ever had, along with a self-help book from the 70's. Ron Willingham is really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one, and it is really disappointing coming from a man who I have held in such high esteem before reading this book. The idea that all sales people's capabilities are driven by their unconscious belief system - the "Area of the Possible," is simply horse-hockey.  The material is dated psycho-analysis applied to a sales program, which is not well written or thought-out.  The logical fallacies of the arguments used to "Prove" the program works are laughable.  Do yourself a favor and don't drink the Kool-aid.  Pass this one by!!!!  
 Ugh. I did not even try to finish the book. It is full of sexual content. Not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature 
 When I read the jacket at the bookstore I just had to get it.  And seeing how the author was so acclaimed from his "Comes A Horseman" novel I figured this would be a great book.  All I can really say about it is it's one of those stories that builds up and builds up but never really delivers 
 I am not pleased with the quality of these knives. They break and dull easily. 
 Small...very small kit, not as advertised.  Every item needs expensive batteries   
 I loved the concept of the book. I hated the presentation.  The book had too many characters, was wordy, and not even entertaining.   Jill Nelson should have hung out with some 40-something sistas to get the lingo right. She tried to hard to make them hype and they came off fake.  Fiction is not real but dang at least make it interesting.  I think Ms. Nelson should  stay with non-fiction and/or write about her generation and what they really are going through.  Lord have mercy this book gave me a headache.  
 For a novel that garnished such high praise, I expected better. I had to work  and force myself to finish. I never became engaged with the character or the story.    
 For those who like mysteries but profer light reading the Pennsylvania Dutch Mysteries should suit them just fine. But to any one who takes their mysteries seriously these books are a joke. This one is no exception. If you want a good belly laugh at how rediculous things can get read on, otherwise go do something else 
 very disappointing publication-suggest you save your money and check it out of the library before making a decision-the front cover was deceptive in its allure to those looking for a creative nudge in decorating tuscany style. but the most chilling part of this book,for me, was a revealing paragraph at the top of page 106 'quote' Given that the farmers probably will not be returning.I begin to plot new purposes for the hundreds of borghi in the italian hills: music camps,artists' colonies,hospices, religious retreat centers. After all,easily taking the past into the future is part or the italian genius for living.'unquote'... well, there goes he neighborhood! i'm just thankful i got to see Tuscany before the Mayes' makeover of the whole region --some people just can't leave rustic charm alone!!...norm 
 Holbeins illustrations are brilliant and fascinating.  This book is very inexpensive.  These two factors should make it a great addition to any library.  But the images are something like 2 inches square.  You can't see any detail really.  I was disappointed and I guess I'll have to find another book as I would like to enjoy this macabre and fascinating series 
 I bought this hoping to learn more about the Vietnamese people and their history. I got bogged down with all the poetry and prose quoted by the writer. While he brushes off the importance of the battle of Dien Bien Phu in a couple of lines; he drones on quoting (translating) obscure Vietnamese writers until the reader becomes weary. His premise seems to be that if you understand some writer (who he thinks is interesting) and attach importance to what he said then you will understand Vietnam. His annoying treatment of Yin and Yang finally caused me to put the book down and look for another way to understand Vietnam. If you like words such as "efficacy" and "entropy" you will love this writer; if such words irritate you, give this book a pass 
 I was drawn to the story because the horse and the family needed healing on many levels.  I wanted to know more about how the horse and teenager were rehabilitated.  Tom Booker, a.k.a. the Horse Whisperer, was an appealing character because he was a very balanced person.  It was his role to be the healer.  He had his wounds, but used them intuitively to help others.  The author portrayed him as a spiritual sort of guy.  Suddenly, we are led to believe that he has an epiphany:  He needs Annie! Unfortunately, their mutual desire was portrayed on a superficial level.  Tom kept remembering her eyes, her smile, etc.  This was teenage crush material; not at all in keeping with his stature or implied integrety.  Furthermore, without giving the ending of the book away, Tom's final decision was totally unbelievable to me, considering the fact that he'd earned the teenage girl's trust.  Just what she needed, more fodder for Post-Traumatic Stress disorder!    The book begins in a promising way, especially when Tom comes on the scene.  However, the ending just didn't live up to my expectations.  I skipped the sex scenes and think the main characters would have been a little better off if they had, too!  
 I was not happy with this cookbook because many of the recipes required that I do something during the day with the recipe, like stir it at 4 hours into cooking, or cook something on a stove then put it in the slow cooker.  I work 100 hour work weeks and I really need something quick and easy, and this book did NOT have many recipes that were quick or easy.  I was so upset with it I had to write in to give the warning out 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 Linda Ashcroft crafted a well-written book of fiction. The dates she claims to have been with Morrison have been publicly proven as inaccurate. She was sued by the Morrison family when the book was first published in Europe and she lost the case, 3/4ths of her advance money and the book was pulled from the shelves. When the book was edited and published in the US, it was proven she did not know Jim and she again lost her advance money and her publishing company canceled her book tour and refused to do any promotion. It would be a great book if she just published it for what it is...fiction. 
 I  stopped the movie halfway thru when 'the band' is butchering 'Ghost Riders in the Sky', some cheap special effects of skeletal horses with ghost riders appear above the stage, and Aykroid activates and summons the blues mobile with a remote control device aka batmobile(the blues mobile can also drive underwater). The only good thing about this movie is it does have a lot of the original cast, but that does not save this film from having horrible acting, dialogue (compare the two Aretha Franklin scenes from both movies as an example), storyline (get the band together and raise money-wow-what an original idea!) and even singing. The choice of songs are moronic at times: the call-in dating service and the 'lookin for a fox' at the strip club come to mind. Truly, this is a bad movie 
 Simplistic doesn't begin to capture the wisdom herein expresse 
 Musty, dated, old boy humor of the kind floating around breakrooms and water-coolers. This stuff wasn't funny when the vaudeville hacks were doing it. I like Mr.Asimov, and probably would have been somewhat charmed by his delivery(maybe). All in all, read Benchley or Woody Allen again for literary laughs and leave Asimov for the 3000 other genres he dabbled in 
 When I bought the book I did not know that they already made a movie out of it but I learned about it later on. So I was really excited when I started to read it - also because other comments were really good. Unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations at all.  First the story development is really slow- it takes an awful lot of pages before the actual crime happens.  Second, several passages in the book do not contribute anything vital at all to the story but only slow down the pace significantly.  The worst part of the book though is its style: It does not matter if a person really contributes anything at all to the story or the crime - he/she gets an extensive characterization. Most of them are several pages long and bore the hell out of the reader. Without this absolutely unnecessary amount of information this book easily could be about 200 pages shorter.  But even if the pace is slow and the book should be shorter, couldn't it still be an interesting book? Unfortunately those of you who hope to find a decent crime story will be disappointed big time as well. The detective aspect is so simple it could be told in less than 100 pages. On top of that the solution to the crime is so simple that after the first clue you know who the murderer is - and wonder why you need to go through over 200 pages to find out officially.  Conclusion: If you are a psychologist and/or like in-depth character studies this is exactly the right book for you. BUT for those of you who like fast-paced stories, ample twist and turns, surprises, action, thrilling developments and/or elaborate detective stories this book will be an absolute waste of your time. Please do not come anyway near it. Watch the movie instead - this way you will see some really great actors and are over with it in 2 hours 
 I bought this as a gift.  The recipient told me that the back of the closure snap scratched his Archos 604 Wifi to the point he returned it for a new one.  I am very disappointed in this product 
 Not very impressive, the only really good song is the writer, the other ones are pretty forgettable. Do Yourself a favor and pick up some of their good stuff like Flying, force it, lights out, etc 
 I've always asked questions to my parents and pastor at church.  Some of the things we learned in school just didn't seem to add up with what was in the Bible.  Dinosaurs and fossils for example always fascinated me.  I still am interested in the ID/evolution debate and want to become well read on both sides of the debate before coming siding with on ideology over the other.  Behe fails miserably for the ID side, his several examples are all reiterations of the same idea that never is able to prove that evolution couldn't happen.  Either he doesn't understand the concept of evolution (doubtful) or he tries to appeal to an audience whom is not well read in science philosophy.  His arguments are faulty and logically can not lead one to believe that life could not have evolved from lower forms.  It seems to more I try to understand the ID side of the debate, the more I lean toward the evolution design side 
 Never seen a worse, less intuitive, inconvenient to use and worsely documented software that iTunes. Apples is up to it's usual standard. That's precisely why I prefer not to mess with it 
 The publication of this book was delayed for 1 year and I was in torture loving Carolyn's other books as I do. To say I was disappointed when it finally arrived is being kind! When I want recipes for great food I go to Martha but from Carolyn I expect recipes for living a VISUALLY beautiful upscale life involving interiors and flowers. With this book (really more of a cookbook and she has a COOK), she "dumbed down" for the Shabby Chic crowd and Martharized her offering for the rest of the public. My eyes teared over A Passion for Flowers. I put this one on the shelf and never looked at it again.  I rate all her other books 5+ each 
 Dorothy Hartley's book, first published in 1931, has many good things about it, and also many not-so-good things.  The book does have a wealth of black-and-white illustrations reproduced from period sources, and these are outstanding.  Ms. Hartley's interpretations of medieval dress, however, are not always on the mark...page 103, for example, has a drawing of a "sleeveless coat" which is actually a mis-interpretation of a fur-trimmed sideless surcote.  Also confusing is the "loose side piece" in her diagram of a hunting tunic on page 57...nothing in the period illustrations would indicate a garment cut and worn that way, and it just doesn't make sense.    So...like a lot of other costume texts published in the early 20th century, don't take everything in this book for gospel truth, and double-check the details against other sources if you're looking for true authenticity 
 I bought this book as I have been asked to start using PERL at work.  All I can say is what a waste of money. It has a tiny index (9 pages).  In a programming book, the index is the most important part of the book.  I get programming books and look-up things when I need help.  If I can even find anything in the book, it points me to the PERL documentation.  I offered it to a fellow co-worker who has been using PERL for a while now and he says it doesn't have anything that a beginner can't pick up using a free online tutorial.  So, don't bother with this book 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 This book could have been written by the "the N.I.C.E" from C.S. Lewis' That Hideous Strength.  This is quite simply the most cynical book I've ever read. There are no positive messages or characters. The Heart of Darkness, an exploration of evil in us all, is cheerful in comparison.  The setting is a religious (Catholic) school called Trinity. The teachers and administrators are called brothers (Jesuits?). The brothers are all either completely corrupt, complicit or psychologically weak. The main character who fights for his own road, in the end, recants. His friend, the only other marginally moral character is portrayed as both weak and unwilling to go against the group, no matter what the cost. The other characters are either portrayed as amoral (Archie) or unwilling to stand up to the promptings of their conscious.   I guess this last point is the most disturbing yo me. There are many characters who are prompted by their conscience to act against some kind of wrong, they all ultimately FAIL TO ACT ON IT.  The main message: Life is pointless and filled with selfish and hateful people. Trying to fight against this (no matter what your conscience tells you) is futile. Those who are the most self-serving and manipulative triumph in the end.  I found this book fully out of touch with reality. I have been down some dark roads in my life and in 42 years have yet to meet anyone as selfish and malevolent as Archie or Brother Leon. The sheer numbers of bad and weak-willed in one school is just absurd.     
 I don't know Tim McGraw the person and therefore cannot comment on this man's character. However, I CAN comment on Tim McGraw the supposed singer/musician. He has a terrible voice and cannot sing, as evidenced by anyone who's ever seen one of the rare clips of him singing live. Nor does he write any of his own songs (even he freely admits this). Nor does he play any musical instruments, unlike country singers such as Brad Paisley, who has real talent at strumming a guitar. And on top of that, Tim McGraw's songs aren't even country music songs (at least not according to the tried-and-true definition of this once great musical genre). I can't really think of any quality of his that should have allowed him to become as 'big' a musical figure as he currently is. So it's external factors - marketing, hype, and of course, that old maxim that "there's a sucker born every minute." And those suckers, of course, are those people who lap up Tim McGraw's 'music' and actually pay money to buy his albums, including this one. Tim McGraw is NOT a country artist. If you want to listen to real country music (and better singing voices to boot), then go look for another artist - they do exist out there, even if they don't have the same hype that applies to Tim McGraw 
 These are not your typical teens. They love Broadway musicals and want a life of singing and dancing on stage. So here they are at "Camp Ovation" honing their skills. One of the teachers is a song songwriter. Because he is also a "one hit wonder" he's an angry alcoholic. The other characters (teenagers) are a "fag hag", a cross dresser, a chubby girl who has her mouth wired shut, a bleached blonde who thinks too highly of herself and her meek sidekick and a rare straight boy at the camp who lacks self-esteem.   There is a three good scenes that made this film worth watching but in general mediocre movie. If you like musicals, you will proberly like this but might bore most people.  
 I ordered 2 of these pedometers and neither of them count steps accurately.  One only counts about half the steps I take and the other is usually 2500 steps behind that.  I wore them both for a week and got the same results everyday.  I could understand if one didn't work properly but I got 2 at the same time with the same problem.  I would not recommend this product 
 This book has generated so much hype, and yet I fail to see how a Christian cannot be other than offended at the way Tenney treats the Bible. I picked this up to read, as it was recommended to me by a number of people, and I put it down again after the first chapter. He talks about the Bible as God's 'old love letters to the church' and defines a God-chaser as someone who is not content 'to camp out on some dusty old truth known to everyone'. I have listened to him preach at a conference and the same derogatory approach to the Bible and its doctrine was evident. So Scripture is not enough? Historic doctrine is inferior to Tenney's direct revelations? The teaching of Scripture is just dusty old truth, not the living word but 'old love letters'? Sorry, but this is nothing but plain mysticism. Tommy Tenney might think he has privileged access to new revelations and experiences of God above and beyond Scripture, but I don't accept it and have no intention of reading a book that so denigrates Scripture. Looks to me like nothing other than a revival of gnosticism 
 I certainly agree that Portis is a talented writer, but I just didn't find him all that funny.  Perhaps I'm missing something, but I thought that the characters were strange enough, not amusing, just strange.  I was frustrated by the characters and the world that they inhabited.  I forced myself to finish the book and I was rewarded by the one funny line in the whole book, which comes at the very end of the novel 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 In this writing the author starts out with an opinion that the disciples were not intellectuals.  What is the basis for this statement?  His basic premise is that Jesus refuted and did not choose the intellectuals of his day.  This presupposes that an intellectual had to be a part of the orthodox establishment.  Where in the Bible does it state that the chosen could not read or did not communicate with others on philosophical or religious matters?  They were all common men classified as laborers, fishermen or clerks.  I will not assume that people of these vocations are all ignorant and unsophisticated.  The author essentially is spurning people of mental capability as related to thinking capacity.  The book is essentially the presenting of the author's own belief system using the disciples as his puppets for story building.  I am indeed struggling through this work anyway.  If you want a heavily romanticized story of the 12 chosen ones this fits the bill.  I was looking for something a little more realistic I suppose.  The disciples seem to be a bit cartoonish in this work. There is a lot of moralizing written in these pages.  The work is better suited to sermonizing then getting a feel for history.    Truth is illusive in this one.  I can't help but feel the disciples might even feel offended by some of these characterizations, if not be humored by them 
 I'm not familiar with the book on which this film is based.  But I am a long time fan of Disney animation.    The quality of this film reminds of the straight to DVD garbage that Disney puts out now.  The story is boring.  The artwork is dreadful.  I fell asleep halfway through watching it 
 I saw the "Young" part.  I even saw the "Black" part.  But "Gifted"?  My God!  This was such a waste of time in my busy life.  I can't believe I was subjected to read such boring nonsense.  If you're thinking of reading this book, DO NOT.  You would have more fun  being dead 
 About this book and author - Since being in the lifestyle for many years my wife and I have been very fortunate in our experiences.  We have been invited into many homes and attended many parties.  It doesn't matter if you're a CEO of a large corporation or a bus driver all are welcome, it's a very level playing field based on trust, honesty, and just people getting to know people.  Now the author of this book and his wife were also invited to some of these parties, homes, and clubs using fake names, Terry and Debbie.  Turns out they're named Jerry and Susie.  Then they move out of town and write a book using everyone's real names.  What's that all about? Sometimes it's not what you do but how you do it.  It's a shame Jerry never had someone to teach him some values.  If this book was about the lifestyle that would be one thing, the truth is it's about a very short 52 year old guy with a Napoleon complex and the love affair he has with himself.  He writes about how all women love him and all men are inadequate or oafs.  If he was entered in a contest at a club and didn't win it was fixed in his opinion.  That's the whole book.  I just saved you $17 bucks.  This is not a swinger's handbook.  If you are already in the lifestyle or thinking of getting into it or just want to know more I would not suggest this book.  It's trash 
 The book basically covers three subjects.  First, a political and historical background of Iraq and Saddam - Excellent.  Besides the history primer, Mr. Keegan also has some thought provoking, if negative,  remarks about Islam (or at least some of its variants) which I may research later.      Second, the events leading to the second gulf war - Poor at best.  I agree that Saddam had to go, preferably sooner than later.  Failing any political progress, war was a likely outcome.  Having terrorized his citizens, started two major wars and having a record of NBC/WMD weapons research he wasn't someone anyone felt comfortable having around.  The UN embargo wasn't working and medical/food shortages were killing up to 50.000 civilians a year, according to some pre-war estimates.  Mr. Keegan jumps firmly, but clumsily, into the pro-war bandwagon.  The issue of missing WMD is never really addressed very well.  Did the Western intelligence agencies really drop the ball?  Or did the US and the UK lie to their citizens in order to drum up support for an unpopular military intervention?  If it wasn't a lie, could the intelligence agencies have done any better?  If not, what lessons to learn from that?  His characterization of opponents to the war is lame.  Mr. Chirac?  "A braggart".  Europeans? "idealistic Olympians who do not recognize the need for force".  And so on...  Now, I dislike Chirac myself. But a skilled author owes his readers some balance and, especially, more justifications.  The French do have a long and shameful history in Iraq.  Selling weapons.  Having their defence minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, refer to Saddam as "a new Napoleon" (which is praise, in France at least) after 1988.  Looking happily to the end of sanctions to sell more stuff in an area without US competition.  Given all that, France deserves criticism, but Mr. Keegan doesn't bother to argue his case by mentioning any of it.  The BBC also gets nailed for its "biased coverage", again without any arguments to support that position.  Personally, I rather liked their coverage and thought its bias less visible than Keegan's.  And, no, I don't think that hoping for a future without wars is silly.  It might not work out, and sometimes (Rwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia) it is better to go to war after all.  It is necessary to resist dictatorships such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.  But you can't fault pacifism as being only for silly idealists.  It has, for now, all but stopped wars among Western nations and it has instilled a healthy distrust of "colonial interventions" by most of those nations' citizens.   Third - the war itself - Not all that great.  There is some high level analysis of what units were moving where, and what they did.  Some coverage of local action, plenty of other interesting stuff.  Keegan is in in element here.    What there isn't is any interviews of Iraqis.  Or any detailed info on Iraqi activity during the war. No Iraqi is mentioned by name outside the usual suspects covered by CNN.  Everything is from the Allies' viewpoint.  I don't blame Mr. Keegan for staying out of Iraq right now.  But it makes you wish that the book was written ten years from now, with Keegan having been able to do his usual world class research.  Nor is there any analysis of how the US should face the Iraq insurgency, despite the 2005 addition to the book.  With current events being what they are, we need people like Mr. Keegan to reinvent themselves as analysts of low-level, guerilla warfare, terrorism, etc...    But this book is more informative about the perils of writing history books too soon, before the facts emerge fully 
 Dashiel Hammett, author of such classics as THE MALTESE FALCON and THE THIN MAN, certainly deserves credit as one of the originators of the noir genre. Unfortunately RED HARVEST doesn't live up to this reputation.  	RED HARVEST starts with the Continental Op arriving in the mining town of Personville (sometimes called Poisonville). He has been hired by the editor of the local paper, who turns up dead. This editor is also the son of mining magnate Elihu Willsson, who had called in a collection of hooligans to break a strike. What he had not foreseen was the inevitability the criminals would take over the town.   	Originally I had the idea the "red" in the title had something to do with the socialist workers movement or the Wobblies, a logical assumption since Hammett was a communist, but Hammett settles for the obvious, the red meaning murder after murder as  the Continental Op turns the criminals against each other.  	A blurb on the back of the book lauds Hammett for "sharply and economically defined" characters. They're sharply defined all right, so sharply defined that they all run together. Pete the Finn, Lew Yard, Max Thaler and Noonan, the chief of police, could be the same character. At the beginning of the novel, the Continental Op learns the history of conflict from Bill Quint, an I.W.W. organizer from Chicago, but that's pretty much the last we hear from him.   	About the only interesting character in the whole book is the femme fatale, Dinah Brand, but her sole motivation seems to be money.  	Hammett also has problems with resolution of conflict. When painted into a corner, he simply kills off another character.  	Even the Continental Op is pretty much a cipher. He doesn't seem to have much of a background, other than that he's somewhat afraid of the Old Man, who runs the Continental Detective Agency. We know he smokes and drinks too much and even takes cocaine, but other than that he doesn't live up to his cool name. Unfortunately all of this reads like a bad comic book. Even Hammett would have a good laugh at what the New York Times said about RED HARVEST, I would assume in 1929 when it was published: "RED HARVEST is more than a superb crime novel: it is a classic exploration of corruption and violence in the American grain." I'll give him two stars for noir dialogue, but the rest of it is pretty much dreck. 
 Half-hearted adaptation of Ernest Haycox novel is weak.  Scott is good as Owen; Knox is equally good as the baddie, but the film is missing movement.  If there were ever a Razzie award at the time, it would have to go to the  title song 
 This book is a relatively boring account of a CIA agent's career.  The author egotistical and conceited, and his description of the CIA is rather superficial.  For the most part he does not delve into the intricacies of the nature of his assignments (this could be for security reasons) 
 I don't want to sound critical, but it looks like this book is written for a blue-collar Michael Moore-style person who cannot understand why in the world his town is in shambles, and, well, I don't think this book would convince Michael Moore that this is how it is supposed to be. Marina first tells the evident -- that corporations are not that benevolent now as they used to be (well, if you consider their old state as 'benevolence', which is a completely separate discussion, of course) and then tries to prove that this is how it is supposed to be. Well, let see, if somebody has an illness and it is not cured, the person dies. That's natural. But you can try to cure it, right? Not just state that dying is natural? So, where is the cure? Marina does not have it. Suggestions of portable life insurance and more tax dollars for retraining may be a pain killer at some time -- albeit not very powerful -- but hardly a cure 
 I found this paper on Amazon as an accessory to the Olympus Camedia P-400 Printer.  This paper does NOT fit the P-400 because this paper is TOO wide.  Thus, with the P-400, this paper is useless 
 Like another reviewer stated, it sounds corny and fake. I must agree.  Some of it is ok, but it sounds like commercialized North American Indian music, which I suppose it is 
 I had the clever idea to compare this version with the new movie.  What a mistake.  The original pink panther is an absolute bore.  There is really no story. Essentially, Peter Sellers spends much of the movie trying to get his wife in bed.  Major parts of the story make no sense.  Don't waste your time 
 If you have heard the songs on the albums covered, and ever read the album covers, save the ink trees and paper wasted on this lame caper. The lyrics and songs are full of misquotes, nothing novel or of note was wrote, paraphrasing the misheard words of spitfire rhymes I've heard a thousand times and apparently this punk "author" had transcribed. Other reviewers explained that is was a lame biography but showed stories that transpired that inspired the spirit of the lyrics you hear, but they obviously were as frightfully uninsightful as the writer. Let me save you the six bucks for the used with the truth: When it's slim spittin' about drugs, it's for fun and humor...When it's Em about family, it's addressin' the rumors...When it's a diss it's clear and every lyric is what your hear and means, love Em or hate `im, what is said verbatim. 
 I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was "Big top Pee-Wee", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.  In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.  The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.  The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good.  
 === quote   Pay no attention to the negative criticisms by those who are obviously Moonies. This is should be required reading. Nansook Hong had the courage to endure and to finally escape the clutches of this dangerous cult led by the Korean flake who thinks he's God.  === end   Funny, so people should not listen to the story of those who are still within the UM, why is this?   Also Rev. Moon himself doesn't claim to be God, this is always said by others, Rev.Moon stresses the point without God he would be nothing... 
 I was searching for titles on Peter of Cluny because an article in Christian History magazine showed that Peter understood that the only way to defeat militant Islam was to approach Muslims with love, learn what they believe, and attempt to share the Gospel with them.   Peter opposed the Crusades. He understood that while the Crusaders might win military victories they would not eliminate the ideas that motivated Muslims to conquer most of the known world because Jihad is commanded by Koran. Peter actually traveled to Toledo in former Moorish Spain and had books from Islam's vast libraries there - including Koran - translated from Arabic to Latin - he even hired a Muslim to be sure the translations were correct.   Peter then wrote two books, the first to Christians explaining what Islam teaches and the second to Muslims refuting Islam. Interestingly, Peter noticed that much of Islam - including the rejection of the deity of Christ - was simply a regurgitation of Christian heresies that had arisen and been refuted before Muhammad was even born. As such Peter saw Islam not as a separate religion but as a heretical form of Christianity.  As a lawyer working on a Ph.D. I know there is a bias prevalent in academia today that views all religions - and anybody who acts on the basis of his faith - with contempt. But true scholars know that you can only judge a religion on the basis of what its authoritative documents teach, not on the basis of what its supposed adherents say or do.  It adds nothing to our understanding to show that anybody can be intolerant, regardless of the faith he claims to profess. But it is important to understand that both Judaism and Christianity teach love your neighbor as you love yourself, a rule not shared by Islam.  I have not read Order & Exclusion and have posted these comments based solely on  the publisher's synopsis, which definitely desuades me from purchasing the book. It seems likely the author does not present Cluny or Christendom in light of the real differences between the teachings of  Islam compared to Judaism and Christianity but rather in light of the current academic contempt for all religion.    
 Dr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner.  He goes thru the motions of "doing his job" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.  I find Jose Saramago's "Blindess" to be a far superior book to The Plague.  Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving.  The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.  I found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over.  I would pass on this book 
 This book was relevant at the time it came out, if nothing for the fact it helped pump the patriotism and zeal to go to war.  However now, after we know the true facts, the lies, and the totally corrupt and inept administration running this country - this book serves no purpose.  I recommend Bob Woodwards new book, "Bush at War Part 2:  Denial", where he illustrates in detail how bad this administration has bungled up everything.  Skip this one, it is no longer relevant.  The only thing Bush is at war with anymore is his own conscience and moral fabric - which is woefully lacking 
 When Bob Clark gave us the original back in the 75 and threw a young Margot Kidder in as a boozing sorority sister who along with the rest are being terrorized by a killer living upstairs in the attic his intentions were to give us a scary movie and not much blood.As a result it worked for the most part.Oh before I forget, Rest in peace Bob Clark.He died at 67 in a head on which also killed his son last week.This version directed by Glen Morgan brings gore and eye balls popping out every chance he gets.Hey there's even a scene where an icicle falls off the roof and pierces through Andrea Martin head.Its laughable! She would of had a better death if she let the killer did it.The acting is so-so but nothing worth noting.They're spoiled girls and very vulgar when they speak.You'll probably do what I did after a while and root for the killer 
 This I by far the worst Scarpetta book in the series. What a shame that Cornwell let this amazing series of books get away from her. First of all, this book does redeem that terrible ending to the preceding work, `Black Notice' in which for the umpteenth time Scarpetta foolishly allows a serial killer into her home for an inevitable dull climax. And this book does have a very engaging premise in which Scarpetta is the victim here on trial, and her name is being sullied. But aside from that, this book is a disaster.   I hated the ending of Black Notice and was furious with Cornwell that she devastated a remarkably taught book with it. Other than that, I thought that the writing was the best she had done and was looking forwards to this new one because it seemed that Cornwell grew as an author from one book to the next. Also I felt that it was well past time that she tried to get away from the very predictable plot line that she has used in every single Scarpetta book up to this point. But for some reason, Cornwell's prose just falls apart here; it is dull and lengthy, without a shred of the suspense that I have grown to expect from this fine author. And the promising plot just collapses as she tries with all of her might to force it into the conformity and safe harbors of her past novels.   Some of what I hated most about this book are that there is no detecting here, Scarpetta just happenstances upon the end solution, its as if Cornwell became tired of writing and just hurried through the last couple of chapters to bring this book to an end. Secondly, Some of what could have made this book interesting, such as Scarpetta's supposed guilt over a murder from `Black Notice' never becomes a full-fledged possibility. Instead Cornwell skates around this alluring plot, spending half of the book building it up, but never pushing it over the edge. Thirdly, what's the point of having any extra characters such as Lucy or Marino? Marino never seems to add anything but bluster, why does Scarpetta always say he is the greatest homicide cop ever? All Marino ever does is leap to the wrong conclusions. Secondly, Lucy and her Last Precinct firm never get off the ground. Why was the Last Precinct firm even in the book? What did Lucy do to help her aunt?  The only interesting thing this book offered was two interactions. One was with the psychiatrist Anna and the other was with the ADA Berger. Both of these scenes either reminiscing over WWII or walking through some evidence were well done.   Cornwell, if you read these, break the mold. Do you have to have serial killers in every novel? Do you have to follow the same plot line?  
 Even the title contradicts itself, proclaiming it to be a true story while also declaring him to be an "accidental" soldier.  Had Crawford been under the impression he was joining the U.S. Rowing Team rather than the NATIONAL GUARD, perhaps he would be just in his incessant complaining.  Instead, he sounds like that guy everyone of us who have served in the military knew, constantly unsatisfied, except in his dissatisfaction.    While he gives, what I assume, an accurate portrayal of the hardships of war, it is hard to get past his constant grumbling.  As with most hardcore fault-finders, he offers no solutions, only grievances...one of the easiest of endeavors.  Crawford seems a paradigm for too many of our young people today.  Shame on us baby-boomers for promoting a mentality of entitlement that would accept the concept of "free" education, only to shun the payment of that bill when/if it comes due.   One thing that comes to mind when reading this book is the concept of "hero," which is bandied about daily in the media coverage regarding our fighting men and women.  In my opinion, this book shows that heroism goes beyond putting oneself in harms way, or obeying orders to do so.  Heroism also includes doing the job right - even when it is hard.  John Crawford is to be commended for following through with his commitment, but not for the way and the attitude with which he portrays his service.  I only hope he has not found a way to make a life-long career of criticism as it could be a miserable existence for him and his future readers.  Bottom line...save your money and time. [... 
 The Greens cookbook is a shoddy, carelessly dashed together list of recipes suitable for use only in a fully stocked restaurant kitchen. Another review pointed out that the recipes are not designed for use outside of the Greens' kitchen. Most recipes require (usually included in small print in the recipe itself) the previous completion of another exceptionally complicated recipe (often fanciful stocks, for which no substitutes are ever given). Some recipes require the previous completion of TWO other recipes, vegetarian shepherd's pie, for example, which should be a fairly simple recipe. Nearly a third of the recipes are pizzas, which I don't need a cookbook for) and the pizza dough recipe (again given in small print at the bottom) is for one 10-inch pizza. Who, I ask, is ever going to make individual pizzas at home? There are also no pictures. This is by far the most useless, arrogant, and user-unfriendly cookbook I have ever tried to cook with, the culinary equivalent of a punch to the kidneys 
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 the last trumpet was great. this is not. some stories have an amazingly weak plot. some are simply not interesting. some are not horror  at all. some i don't even understand. it is well written, i'll give him that. but he needs better plots than this. it seems like he wrote these stories sufferig from an overdose of literature after a vacation. perhaps he will do better next time. promising battle descriptions in one story. some regular fantasy stories a la Robert E. Howard by Rainey wouldn't be a bad thing. i'll buy it if you write it, Rainey 
 This was my first reading of Jamaica Kincaid. She has a short, concise style, which made me often feel like I was reading poetry. However, I felt that it also had some downsides, like stifling character growth. In Lucy, the title character comes to America to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters. Lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother, who for some reason she hates. I wish we knew a bit more about Lucy, like why she hated her homeland so much. It was  an alright quick read, but had it been longer, I doubted it would have held my attention 
 This book was written in 1969 and tells about how it is better to bury a son or daughter than to have him/her loose their chastity.(pg. 63)  Bishops give this book to teenagers when they have commited a sin without even reading the book themselves, not realizing the contents of this book.  We hope that this message will help teenagers not believe what is written in this book. God is forgiving and loving and in the Bible it says to repent to him, God, not a "elected" man (bishop) who has no training in counseling or phychology to give advice or give you this book.  Page 196 states that "it is better to die in defending ones virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle." Remember, all of this is what the author thinks and not what God thinks. There are no quotes in this book from the Bible, only the books of the LDS church. Please do not read this book for it breeds guilt, sorrow, humiliation, and sadness for the rest of your life. Thank you, a previous LDS member. Been there, done that. Still recovering from 1986 
 This film is a spoof of a lot of other films in the same tradition as Not Another Teen Movie and Scary Movie. Only those films have redeeming qualities while the entire existence of this film is one big goof.   Eddie Griffin does a pretty good job considering the bad material he was given; but this movie is just ridiculous.  I only chuckled 4 times: 1. One scene involving a Britney and K-Fed spoof. 2. An Eddie Griffin line when he's spoofing Robert DeNiro from Meet the Parents. 3. When the main male character (I don't even care enough to remember or look up their character names) is parodying Brad Pitt from Mr. and Mrs. Smith during the psychiatry session. 4. During the Hitch spoof, the midget guy is pointing to pictures of all of the celebrity couples he's responsible for putting together even though they are no longer together. e.g. Tom and Nicole, Ben and Jen, Brad and Jen, Matt and Ben, Anne and Ellen, etc.  Bottom Line: Pass; unless you want a movie to laugh AT instead of WITH. But you'll probably be more disgusted than anything 
 this cd is not worth the 14 dollars it costs. It was a complete waste of energy and money. no matter how hard u try, you just can't dance to any of mariah's songs. This dyke troll is getting really weak and her beats are starting to get old and boring. she'll never fit into anything at dressbarn, for those of u who dont know, that's a plus size store. that nasty oreo is a straight hooch and she cant sing, she just screams and whispers like a man. she cant find a note and her face can stop a clock. lose weight! all the ppl who gave her good reviews are just trynna support her cause they're oprah lovin trash who think mariah represents compton even though shes a troll. done 
 Tiger Rising is about a young boy, Rob, whose mother has just died.  He and his father move to a new and very small town and are living in a motel.  He makes friends with a girl, Sistine, who goes to school with him.  Together they explore the woods near where he lives and find a caged tiger.  Sistine wants to let the tiger go free.  Rob isn't sure.  Soon circumstances arise that make Rob a part of keeping the tiger caged.  The book wasn't subtle.  Similarities between the caged tiger and the people trapped in their own ways were really spelled out for me.  Willie Mae, the maid who befriends Rob, points out the moral to most chapters.  It wasn't bad so much as it just didn't feel right.  A strong point to the book was the characters.  Many side characters had some depth to them and throughout the story Rob and his father are more and more revealed as they deal with Rob's mother's death.  This isn't a bad book, but I still didn't like it.  I don't recommend going out of your way to get it, but don't avoid it either 
 I loved ECW.  So everytime a dvd or book comes out about ECW, I do a double take.  I could write a really long review on this book, but I'll condense it really quickly to save you the time:  1.  Thom Loverro may be a respected and longtime journalist, but he obviously knows nothing about ECW.  He can't even decide if the name is Mike "Nova" Bucci or Mike Nova.  The writing style is drab and reads like someone took a pile of notes and threw them on a page, then made barely-conscious transitions.  2.  It's a dvd rehash.  That was obvious from the beginning but I was hoping it would provide something interesting.  I was wrong.  If you have the dvd there's no point in reading this.  3.  The innacuracies are frustrating.  One would think at least one fact-checking session could have been devoted to this.  Taz is even labeled as Mikey Whipwreck.  Small children, after watching one show featuring the two, could have noticed there's a difference.  I would have given my eyeteeth to recommend this book and I rarely consider reading even the silliest books to be a waste of time, but this really was a waste.  It's sloppy, badly put-together, many times inaccurate and totally devoid of any real passion.  If you really want to read it try to check it out at a library 
 The cover of this album describes it as 'Leave-taking from the British Folk revival 1970-1977' and that was indeed a period worth commemorating.  This collection, sadly, does not do it justice.  There are only 13 tracks (and only 9 artists, as 4 of them appear twice) and what there is in no way represents the best of the period.  The Watersons were a great group, but Lal Waterson, singing solo on two of these tracks, is painfully out of tune.  The other performers on this album are fine, and are well worth a listen, but you will find them all better represented on other albums.  I realize that this selection is restricted to recordings from the Trailer label, but I cannot believe this is the best they could do.  Both quality and quantity are lacking.  A sad leave-taking indeed.  
 I was given "Videohound's Horror Show" as a Christmas present the past year, and just finished working my through it the other day. I have to say I was really disappointed overall. As other reviewers point out so well, why are "Alice in Wonderland", "Platoon" and "Wizard of Oz" included here? There are so many movies that may have horrific elements in them, but they are still not horror films. Even if you take those films out of the mix, the biggest issue I have with Mike Mayo's work, is that he is approaching and reviewing these films with a main-stream sensability. Mayo's approach to most of the films presented in this book are written as if for a non-horror fan audience. Most horror fans know what to expect with a "Halloween" sequel, we aren't looking for quality film making like "Shakespeare in Love". We just need to know if Michael is creepy, what's the body count, and are the special effects worth the ticket price? I was hoping to find some "new" titles here, but to be honest even a casual fan of the genre, will be pretty familiar with the movies listed here.  The one aspect of this book that I did like, was that Mayo was not into giving away spoilers. Rarely does Mayo spill the beans about any twists or shocks pertaining to any of the films he reviews, and that was a breath of fresh air.  As a horror fan I would recommend you check out "Legacy of Blood: a Comprehensive Guide to Slasher Movies" by Jim Harper instead of VideoHound's offering. "Legacy" doesn't cover nearly as many films, and sticks just to the Slasher genre, but it is well written, and features reviews written for horror fans by a horror fan. Jim Harper "gets" horror, and knows what a horror fan wants 
 This CD really had a lot of promise and could have been just great. In fact when I popped it in my CD player it started out great. From reading the liner notes I already knew that the last track was also to be found on another compilation album, Arabesque. That album BTW is a must for almost any music collection. It turns out however that no less then four of the ten tracks of "Mystic Groove", all on the last half of the CD, are lifted straight out of "Arabesque". It would have been so easy to replace those tracks by different ones from the same fabulous artists. So, to make a long story short, save your mon and buy the much better and longer "Arabesque" instead. Don't support this blatant rip-off 
 This book contains an interesting, but never really captivating story. All concepts that make this book worth reading are already present in the first third of the book. Subsequent developments are in line with the story, but I felt little value was added for most of the middle part of the book. Only in the very end, the pace picks up again into a dramatic conclusion.  If the book had been one third the size, I would have enjoyed reading it to the end. Now it just felt like a burden to complete it 
 I must disagree with the others who gave this book a poor review. I do believe the book is not exploiting fear. It is depcting the truth of a horrible subject and those who downplay this are in some denial. Unfortunalty, how the book conveys this is sub par. It focuses mainly on the offender's mind and the type of horrible crimes offenders commit, but it is often redundant. It briefly departs from its overly dramatized narratives to cover types of offenders, but for the most part I found myself having to hunt for information. Many passages in the book read like a novel with the author trying to play up the drama of the situation which will be almost like culture shock to nayoen used to reading typical psychology books on this subject. It has a lot of filler, I think, and is certainly not a concise information packed book.  The book does drive home one very important thing, though- sex offenders can be anyone- your neighbor, your friend, your pastor and that is the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 
 I tried setting up the router, but was unsuccessful. The web interface didn't work with IE7, and web pages were being displayed garbled. I had to download Firefox to talk to it. The 1 gigabit output switch worked properly, as did DHCP. I set up the router for my cable modem, with static IP address and DNS servers. I couldn't connect to the Internet, even though the router thought I was connected. After a frustrating interaction with Linksys customer support, it was decided that the router was defective and I returned it. I also found from customer support that this model is not being supported under Vista 
 This book was advertised as though it would be valuable for any professional. This is absolutely not the case. This book covers very, very basic guidelines and does so in an overview type fashion. I would recommend this book for college graduates or those who are employed at entry level jobs and are seeking advancement 
           J. M. Buchanan's(JMB)book is completely mistitled and out of date.Nowhere in any of Keynes's writings does Keynes ever advocate a policy of deficit finance,which is actually the brain child of Abba Lerner,a member of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis school of economics.Lerner used the term functional finance to describe deficit finance.During a visit to America in 1944 as the representative of England's Treasury Department,Keynes totally disagreed with Lerner's approach.Keynes's approach is an advanced version of the cyclically balanced budget first laid out in clear terms to the Pharaoh by Joseph some 3,700 years ago-build up a surplus in the good years that will cover the deficits of the bad years.This is the first statement of what economists call a countercyclical fiscal policy.Keynes's additional provision is that the budget be split into two categories-one of which would be a capital budget.The government could only run deficits in the provision of capital projects in public infrastructure(building dams,reservoirs,water projects-irrigation networks,seaports,airports,public transportation projects,public schools,colleges and universities,public research laboratories,etc.,)that would pay for themselves in the long run.Nor was Keynes an advocate of tax cuts in an economic downturn except for temporarily suspending the  social security tax for workers only.Keynes's major policy recommendation was the maintenance of low interest rates combined with a central bank policy of eliminating loan availability for speculative undertakings(greenmail,leveraged buyouts,hostile takeovers,margin account loans,corporate raiders,junk bonds,etc.).The correct title for JMB's book up until 1981 is"Democracy with minor to moderate deficits:The Political Legacy of the American Keynesian-Neoclassical Synthesis School".After 1981,JMB should have retitled his book as"Democracy and Catastrophic Deficits:The Political Legacy of Laffer,Reagan,and the 12 years of the Two  Bush Presidencies" .The national debt when President Reagan took office stood at 925 billion dollars.As of July,2005,the national debt will have surpassed 8 trillion dollars.The Libertarian-pseudo conservative policies of tax cuts,borrowing and excessive spending of  8 years of Reagan and 12 years of the two Bush presidencies has increased our national debt by a factor of 9.JMB needs to completely rewrite his book.First,he needs to incorporate the theoretical foundations of the story of Joseph and the Pharaoh from the Old Testament.He will probably need to purchase a bible in order to correctly cite verse and page.Second,he needs to obtain a copy of Keynes's General Theory and read what Keynes actually wrote and not what Henry Hazlitt claims what Keynes meant in his 1959 "Failure of the 'New Economics'".   
 How to Write a Book Proposal explains how to get a non-fiction book published. It explains various important aspects pertaining to writing effective non-fiction book proposals. The aspects highlighted are how to test-market the potential of a book idea, choosing the best agents and editors and trying to influence publishers to make a good offer.  I have read several hundreds of books but somehow with this book failed to impress me. I was in the process of writing my first book, but I could not find this book to be of much practical use to my book writing project. The title of the book to me did not relate to the contents and the flow appeared haphazard. Each chapter in isolation could be readable and make sense but one chapter does not logically lead to the next. I read this book having completed reading another one entitled "Writing Nonfiction- Turning Thoughts into Books by Dan Poynter". The contrast could never be starker. I had hoped that the book would be a natural follow on after reading the delightful little book by Dan Poynter. However, I was very disappointed and the book was a waste of my money. 
 I simply cannot comprehend the anti-capitalist rantings on this and other sites. Bill Quinn is a bitter old man. He is bitter about his life and about his life choices. He obviously resides in a fantasy world in which nothing changes and progress is unheard of.   Is Wal-Mart evil? No, because even though corporations are considered persons for business purposes, they in fact have no persona. That is, a corporation cannot be evil because a corporation is not a living being. It is a legal entity comprised of physical assets and managed by people.   I will repeat my usual comments with regard to anti-Wal-Mart individuals.   1. If you think Wal-Mart is a horrible employer-don't apply for a position there.  2. If you think Wal-Mart is a horrible buyer-don't deal with Wal-Mart.  3. If you think Wal-Mart is not a consumer's best friend-don't shop there.  Wal-Mart does NOT put the little man out of business. The only "little man" harmed by Wal-Mart (ie. by the customers)is the mom and pop that is open M-F from 9:30am to 4:00pm with an hour for lunch. It is the mom and pop that offers a poor selection of shoddy merchandise at ridiculously high prices because you cannot get this merchandise anywhere else. Then, when Wal-Mart comes to town, the people who have been held hostage by small-town economics choose to shop at Wal-Mart. Low prices, convenient hours, great selection, no hassle return policy, and a clean shopping experience make Wal-Mart the retailer of choice. Certainly there is a reason why those with a choice, the consumer, choose Wal-Mart.   When our new super Wal-Mart opened, it spawned two seperate shopping plazas, including a new Giant Eagle, a Target, A Dick's Sporting Goods, Sam's Club, Starbucks, Quiznos, numerous restaraunts, clothing stores, pet stores, shoe stores, jewelry stores, office supply stores, etc. All of these stores are thriving. Given the arguments posted here, there should be 20 empty storefronts and one evil Wal-Mart, still open for business. Reality over Rhetoric, people.  Finally, the economic impact. I will not mention Wal-Marts substantial charitable endeavors. Rather, I will mention the 1.5 million jobs and millions of indirect jobs. I will mention the nearly $300 billion in stock market wealth created by Wal-Mart. I will mention the billions of dollars in wages, taxes, and benefits to local communities. I will mention the billions in income taxes paid each year. Finally, I will mention Wal-Marts contribution to the GDP. Not only does Wal-Mart contribute to top line GDP growth, it also contributes to productivity by decreasing the cost of purchased goods billions each year. American consumers save anywhere from $10-$20 billion a year because of Wal-Marts downward price pressure. That money is used to benefit consumers everywhere.   Think about the facts before you begin a debate about a subject most of you do not understand. Oh, do I welcome responses 
 Anyone who objects to describing this mess as elevator muzak has no defense - the sad fact is that Gaucho is playing in elevators and restrooms around the world at this very moment!  Where to begin? The backup singing is absolutely atrocious, the piano tinkling so lame you find yourself swallowing hard to keep from vomiting, and the list goes on and on. Mark Knopfler was apparently in the studio for one song but the only evidence of it is the song credits. To top it off, this CD finally concludes the series of new liner notes by Becker and Fagen written for the re-mastered discs. Following the trend from the previous CDs, these notes are pretentious, uninformative, and too cute by several orders of magnitude.  Thanks to Aja and Gaucho, few in the late 80's or 90's bothered to wonder where Steely Dan had disappeared to - the concensus was that if this was all they had to offer then thanks for the first five albums and so long - it's been good to know ya 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 There are some great acoustic music superstars on this DVD.  Sam Bush, Bela Fleck, Jerry Douglas, and Tim O'Brien are clearly at the top of their game.  But, other than the one Hot Rize performance, this is not bluegrass in any traditional sense of the genre.  It does present some really great extended jam band music, often with acoustic instruments commonly associated with bluegrass.  A quick check of the credits at the end of the film suggests that there were, indeed, some true bluegrass artists at the concert, but they were clearly left out of the DVD lineup.  If you like the Sam & Bela show, this DVD is for you.  If you are looking for a bluegrass video, keep looking 
 A book not good enough for beginners ...really more of a how-to-paint magazine lacking actual info on how to paint...better to study masters and take classe 
 I'd never read Berry before, but as far as I can tell, this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory. However, it's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm. There are two related problems with the book: one of presentation, and one of tone. The problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there's no room for specifics. So, while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of Berry's vision, there's no detail to back it all up. The problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at. Of course, some of the pieces are lectures, but there's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book. It comes out when Berry uses certain words such as the three As of "appropriate", "authentic" and "adequate". When these are used ( as they often are), there he's obviously made some kind of value judgment, but the reader is never let in on it. The end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic -- which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir.  Which is unfortunate, since I tend to agree with Berry on a lot of things (though not his anti-abortion stance). Small farms are good, agribusiness is bad, stewardship of the land is good, extraction industries are bad, treating the body as an organic whole is good, and things of that nature. Alas, he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful. Two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate: "This is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed." and "Communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people, country life, and country places."   Berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses. For example, in one essay, he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine, untouched state, and that's all. While there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way, they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with Berry's views on stewardship and land use. It certainly doesn't help matters that his view of small-scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose-colored glasses. His claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition. However, it ignores the fact that, historically, small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins, was subject to all kind of external instability (weather, vermin, etc.), and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level. In farming, cash is scarce, that's why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself, such as in WWII, when all those defense-industry factories were opened in California. (Of course, in Berry's vision, you don't really need cash, because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors.)   Berry's exhortations to create small-scale communities is worthy stuff, and even in cities people are creating this. The growth of CSAs, farmers markets, and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this. However, to achieve the large scale results Berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection 
 Nickel Creek fans, obviously, will love this syrupy solo album by the guitarist of the aforementioned famed popgrass fusion band.  Presumably this mostly-instrumental outing is intended to demonstrate Watkins' chops as a picker, yet it follows so closely in the saccharine tradition of Nickel Creek that it doesn't do much to differentiate his work from theirs.  The album opens with "Neo's Song," which sounds like a watered-down version of Tony Rice's note-bending flatpicking style; the rest of the album gets progressively muzak-ier and Windham Hill-ish.  Watkins has lots of technical facility, but his artistic instincts are hopelessly bland 
 All the songs on the album, except for When You Were Young, are a drag. It sounds like the songs were written on the fly. What happened to the melodies and retro synth sounds from Hot Fuss?! (I really liked that album.) I am not sure what direction The Killers were/are headed---I think they got lost in Sam's Town. To answer "we hope you enjoyed your stay" in track 12.... Not really. Sorry 
 The publishers should be sued. Maybe we should get a class-action together.  Imagine taking an instruction manual for the very first Apple computer and putting a new title on it "How to use your new home computer" and selling it in bookstores today. This book is doing EXACTLY that!  Also, it is highly doubtful that the tactic ever worked in the first place. The author's website vanished years ago. In a thinly traded NYSE stock if you try to repeatedly front the specialist with 2000 share orders he will simply move the price 50 cents against you immediately following your next purchase. Game over.  [... 
 This book is a long winded explanation of the features of SharePoint 2003.  It provides redundent how tos with little explanation of how to do anything that is not vanilla out of the box.  I suggest simply becoming familar with the Administrative Guide that Microsoft produced.  You'll be you degree closer to the source and 33 dollars richer in the pocket. 
 As soon as I read this book, I wished I was the type of customer who sent back books of little value.  We have just began the process of adoption and we are exploring the different avenues available in domestic adoption so I thought this book would be helpful, but instead I found the same information I was able to obtain in less than one day at the computer, by entering "Adoption" in my search engine. The chapter containing the laws of every state was concise and puts it all in one easy package but I am not sure if that is enough to make this worthwhile. The book also lacked any real material on the homestudy process, what you might excpect from agencies versus attorneys versus state agencies, and the pros and cons of each.  So if you are completely new to the process of adoption, want the facts and nothing but the facts, are pretty sure that you want to use an attorney and conduct your own search for a prospective birth mother, then this book is for you.  If not you might want to look elsewher 
 In WPF, Plantinga tries to provide an account of warrant that is superior to rivals such as Goldman's process reliabilism.  The work suffers from the following defects.  First, he is too quick in dismissing rival accounts.  Second, his arguments against evolutionary-naturalism will only convince those who already think that evolutionary naturalism is false.  Third, while he is quick to dismiss rival views, his own positive answers to philosophical problems are entirely unsatisfactory.  Consider his 'solution' to the Benacerraf problem.  It seems that mathematical statements refer to abstract objects.  It also seems that there must be a causal connection between our belief forming processes and the objects of belief if those beliefs are to be thought of as viable candidates for knowledge.  Plantinga says that this is not a problem for the theist who is willing to say that mathematical principles are structures of the divine mind since surely the connection between God and God's subjects is not problematic.  How one could think that Benacerraf's problem is a genuine one and that this is an adequate solution is beyond me.  While his WCD is to be recommended to those wanting an introduction to epistemology, this book is of limited merit 
 When I saw this book, i thought it was a good book for me.  but when  i began to read it (after i bought it), i noticed something that i hadn't before: this was a woman's book.  and not only a womens book, but a businesss  womens book.  i am not a woman, nor am i a business person, so i couldn't relate to the author AT ALL.  So, I wouldn't recomend this book to boys, guys, or men; nor would i recomend it to women that can't relate to business-type stuff (which i can't).  i feel bad that i wasted my money on a book written for the oppisite sex, but oh well... it was bargain price! My ratings is innaccurate for the appropiate adience of this book, though... 
 Okay really, bands like Kittie make it seem like chicks can't do metal. Kittie make cr a p p y bands like Otep and Evanescence look like Arch Enemy or The Gathering for fu c k's sake! None of the band members can play their instruments properly, they just play simple riffs without soloing. The vocalist just screams like an as s. The lyrics are more whiney emo/metalcore cr a p about how they broke up with their boyfriends or how they want to slit their wrists. Kittie fans have dumb Myspaces with names like "Dark Princess" or "Bleeding Roses". Of course I'm going to get negative reviews because I'm not supporting this junk but instead of this, listen to real chick metal like Arch Enemy, The Gathering, or Nightwish.  Burn in hell Kittie!! 
 This book was extremely difficult to understand. Full of big complicated terms that could have been said in simply easy to understand words.  If all my texts had been like this, I'd never have made it through school.  Not at all appropriate for undergrad work.  It's the only text I sold back, and was glad to get rid of it. A total waste of money. I had to buy another HBSE book just to figure out what this one was trying to say. 
 The theme of the plot & story are very good, but after reading Rattlesnake Crossing, this was a disappointment. Maybe Jance is trying to develop her characters & their relationships here. But there is so much superfluous dialogue it becomes boring. A couple pages later you get lucky & she returns you to the story. A previous reviewer stated his least favorite chapter was #20. I agree. Unfortunately Chapter 20 is where the book's climax takes place. More superfluous nonsense in the middle of the story with the introduction, ever so briefly, of another character & a dog. Unneeded fluff. The book falls flat on it's face in it's ability to tie the story together well at the end. Possibly Jance was so distracted by other dialogue. Save your time & money unless you need a sleeping pill. Dead to Rights will put you out in short time 
 I have been an extremely devoted SMB fan since the very first time I laid eyes on it. I own ALL of them, and so when I stood in line all night Saturday (and through Sunday morning, 8am), I made sure to grab myself a copy of SMB: Banana Blitz for my brand new Wii. I bought an entire set of controllers, anticipating the mini-game fun with all my friends. (We're huge SMB fans, all of us. It always makes an appearance at our parties.)  But now I'm really angry. They completely gutted our favorite mini-game(s), hitting Monkey Target worst of all. I can honestly say I don't care that there are 50 freakin mini-games, because now Monkey Target is completely worthless. Instead of the amazingly subtle game play with bonus items, increasingly difficult levels, magnets, velcro, double bonuses, wind speed and direction, and the all-import ramp run-off you have... a cannon, one level, no wind or wind direction, no bonuses, and no special items.  Who cares if I can SORT of pilot a submarine on a single level? Monkey squash -- no joy there. A lot of the controls for the mini-games are terrible. And so on, so forth. The new mini games suck almost unilaterally, but gosh darn, there are 50 of them! But volume does not make up for lack of quality.  I love traditional SMB levels and the ones on SMB: Banana Blitz are nice. The graphics are beautiful and fun. But the best part of the game for me and my friends, is now gone and dead. None of the reviews I'd read mentioned the fact that this favorite of most SMB players was killed like this, and if they had, I certainly wouldn't have wasted my $50 plus tax.  If Sega people are reading this: BRING BACK MONKEY TARGET. That's what people play at parties when they're slightly drunk and sick of listening to Super Smash Brothers, and way too awake to enjoy Mario Party 
 This was my first Sidney Sheldon and surely it will be my last. I only picked up this audio book, because I wanted some mindless entertainment on my long drive down to LA from SF...and it was one of the few audio books at my local library...anyways, the premise was interesting. But the twists and turns were just preposterous, unbelievable.  I found myself laughing at the characters' predicaments. The dialogue was inauthentic and made me wonder, 'who would say such a thing in a real conversation?'. Perhaps it was the bad actress who read the book?  I wonder how Sheldon became so famous with this kind of pedestrian writing. Thank goodness I didn't purchase this book. For this genre, I much prefer Dean Koontz, John Sanford, and even Mary Higgins Clark.   
 My daughter loves to learn new words/signs, however, these were not ones we used regularly, so it was not as useful as I thought 
 Ted Rall is a cartoonist and in way's we can say that he lives in a cartoon world. He very much wants to believe in the greatness of socialism, he wants to believe that everything good in this world has arrived from socialists and that everything bad comes from conservatives. Living a life like this is hard and causes one to make gross fabrications. To Mr. Rall superman, spider-man and wonder-women exist. But to us, slightly more well adjusted persons, we view these characters as fictionalized cartoons. Unfortunately Mr. Rall's book is that of cartoon-land so filled with these fabrications, that it really becomes a work of fiction.   It goes without saying that from the-1940's - 1980's, America was pulled brutally to the left. The Conservative Party was weak and simply capitulated to the powerful democrats. During the 1980's the American people realized this country's slide toward socialism, they also began to see that the policies were failing miserably to create the supposed utopia of the left. So starting from the 1980's to current day the pendulum has begun to swing back towards the center. The problem though is that the center now has been moved so far left that the republican party of today appear more like the democrat party of the 1960,s. In essence we do have a one party system, Socialist party A or Socialist Party B. But there are still some differences.   Rall doesn't quite understand that in our current situation, in which Democrats, whose domestic policy are carefully tailored to benefit a narrow socioeconomic segment of wealthy individuals, unions, lawyers and fringe special interest groups has become unpalatable to the average middle class American. Across the country, from California to New York, the hard leftist democratic candidates were unable to motivate their own base, let alone attract the center voters required to win close races. What Rall doesn't seem to get is that the Middle American doesn't view the Democrats as targeting the Republicans as opponents, instead the Democrats target America and the way of life that Middle America lives.  For example, Teddy has himself in an uproar because of GW's tax cuts "that favor the rich" Unfortunately this hard-left mantra just isn't true. Anybody who has simple cognitive skills can reed the CBO report that was produced at the request of congressional Democrats. It confirms that tax cuts since 2001 increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners. INCREASED!   It increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners, while decreasing the tax share of lower and middle-income groups.   Hello, automata on the left, are you paying attention, go back and read the CBO report about Clinton's draconian tax increase on the MIDDLE CLASS. It very clearly stated that lower and middle-income groups had their taxes RAISED disproportionately, while the top earners received little if any tax increase.   If you favor the middle class you have to vote republican, not for elitist billionaire candidates like Kerry, who would only hand out more favors to his fellow billionaires.   Ted and his ilk are so out of touch with the average Middle American that this doesn't make sense to him. They don't understand that people don't like being lied to. The biggest problem is that Ted believes that you can say whatever you want, this doesn't work anymore. With today's access to information you can show a lie so quickly it just doesn't make sense to say one.   For example, Ted lies about 2000 election on just about every count. First of all the state was called for gore 70 minutes before the polls closed in Florida. (Sorry Ted your lie that it was 10 minutes is patently false.) This early and fraudulent call was a concentrated effort by the liberal media to help disenfranchise the states voters. Democratic (yes, democratic) pollsters put the number of disenfranchised voters at between 10,000 - 15,000 that decided not to vote in the panhandle region. This, btw, is predominantly republican country.    But what is even more appalling is that the exit polling by all major news outlets was showing that Bush was winning. The extent to what liberals will do to swing the vote unethically in their favor is atrocious.  Gore's slide into win at any cost came quickly with his lawyers filling a petition to stop the counting of oversees military ballots. These ballots, btw, were never counted and added to the official total. Since most of them would have voted Bush and by counting the disenfranchised voters Bush easily won the state.   Now remember, the only reason the Supreme Court got involved was because the socialist state judges refused the follow the law. Gore only wanted the most liberal of all counties to be counted, but the state rules said all the counties had to be recounted. The first Supreme Court decision was 9-0 the second was 7-2, both of these decisions said in effect that the whole state had to be recounted. Ted's argument that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction is merit-less, the presidential election is FEDERAL not a state election.  In the end the state recounted the ballots 4 different times and in all 4 Bush one.   Then a bunch of hard left media outlets got together at a cost of nearly $1 million bucks to try to PROVE that Gore won (NORC).  Cartoon-boy tells us that "Media Consortium Statewide Count of `Undervotes' and `Overvotes' Proves Gore Won Under Any Standard." (PAGE #)  This statement is blatantly, undeniable False, a big fat Lie and you can download the NORC document yourself. The NORC reports that they recounted all of the votes using 9 different methodologies. Bush won eight out of the nine and he won by a larger margin than was officially certified.  Sorry Cartoon-Boy your lies are great for the socialistic automata; for me I prefer to remain in the middle and support the truth. 
 If it's true that everything is good for something, even if it is a bad example, this book might by used accordingly, otherwise, don't waste your time.  Each chapter of this book is written by a different professional writer, each with a story to tell about her particular life, relationships, etc.  I found it to be a disturbing and even appalling read on many levels.  For one, these women are not "typical" in that they do not represent the rank and file of American women, wives and mothers, at least not the ones that I know!  They are professional writers who are urban, educated, liberal, and comparitively affluent.  These women live and work primarily in academia.  The book is a compilation of chapters in which these writers rant, whine, confess and obsess about their relationships, careers, etc. It misses the point of getting views from women of all walks of life and social status.    I found this book offensive in that because they have, as writers, the platform to flaunt their deviance and dysfunction (sexually, morally, politically, etc. ), they play it off as normal and representative of the rest of us.  Perhaps in their literary or academic worlds, they are the norm, but for the vast majority of us wives and moms out here in the real world, I don't think so!  I got the impression that many of these women thought it was somehow a display of their writing prowess if they divulged more dark, freaky, wacko secrets and shocking confessions than their sister in the previous chapter, be it on their affair with another woman, a married man, or their open marriage.      The Hannah Pine piece is particularly disturbing and I can see why she uses a pseudonym; had her real name been used there would be no reason why this pitiful woman would not be carted off to the mental health ward.  She writes of the affairs she and her husband have had with other people and her obviously unsuccessful, yet frighteningly denied, attempt to justify the affairs as anything negative or unhealthy, even priding herself on chosing to not be angry over her husbands habit of sleeping with other women.   Afterall, that could put a damper on his lust and we wouldn't want to restrict him in such an negative and oppressive manner...  PUH-LEEZE!!!!!    
 A fascinating story that succeeds somehow despite the terrible writing.  It as if the authors simply assembled at random the chapters and, in many cases, whole paragraphs within any given chapter.  There is no discernable  flow or organization to the tale -- chronoglogical or otherwise -- and it  is difficult to follow the events being described.  As acknolwedged in one  of the introductions, it appears that the book was all too hastily thrown  together in the face of a looming deadline.  Still, the story is worth  reading for software engineers, entrepreneurs and others involved in the VC  industry 
 This filter does seem to work well, however, I am returning it due to the excessive noise that it makes.  If you look at the other reviews (for the HFD-130) you will see the noise described as "white noise"; let me explain the noise that it makes a little better than that.  The unit does make a white noise that is associated with the moving fan blades.  However, underlying this noise is a lower pitched motor noise that is more of a whining sound - like a vacuum cleaner.  This noise is less than the white noise on the low setting, about equal to the white noise on medium, and overpowers the white noise on high.  The other quality of the whining noise is that you can hear it from a further distance than the white noise.  So when you have the unit on high, you can hear the whining noise resonating throughout my home, i.e. through the floorboards and through the walls.  I think that one of the greatest considerations with an appliance such as this should be noise.  I cannot understand why the Honeywell engineers have not done a better job considering this 
 We are HUGE Amazon customers and we have always been so pleased with our purchases.  However we were shocked when we went to use 4 out of 6  of these expensive wine glasses.  THEY FELL APART!  The glass is tissue thin!  Perhaps from shipping there are many fine fractures????  One fell apart in my guest's hand...three fell apart later that night while being rinsed out.  we handled these glasses so delicatly...I have 2 more and we would like to send them back and be reimbursed for all 6. 
 As many other reviewers have noted, the scene with Janeane Garofalo and Randy Quaid is hilarious.  The rest is a waste of time.  Go to the chapter with Janeane, and you'll be alright.. 
 Reading this book reminded me of how you sometimes watch a bad movie just to see how bad it can get.  I did a lot skimming (fast forwarding) to see if it was consistent right up to the end.  It was.  Don't waste your time.  This was my first Iles book and will surely be my last 
 I totally agree with the last comment.  A lot of you gave this book five stars because you feel "minorities" are acting paranoid, acting out.  You're thinking, i've never had a racist thought in my life!  Never called anybody names!  My people give other peoples freedom, gives them jobs, saves their souls, and do nice things like correcting their English.  if you say that, then chances are you don't have any close friends who are not "White."  If you say you do, then they probably act and speak like you.  It's time for American writers to start talking about racial conflict in this divided nation openly, instead of pumping out these passive-agressive texts using political correct language.  Thumbs down to Schlesinger's one-sided book 
 A Business book does not have to be boring, this one is. And, if you can keep your eyes open long enough to read it, you will be lucky if you learn two new things per chapter. This book may be suitable for someone who is thinking about changing profession from lumberjack to design sales person, but there are still better choices. To be honest, I only read half of it and now I am back on Amazon looking for another book on the subject... 
 The timing in this story is achingly slow, compared to many of today's novels...the language is not particularly metaphorical or even colorful, although the sentences are short.  But lacking dialogue it remains dull, dull and I am unable to visualize the characters - more description is needed, and frankly, if it wasn't for previous success he may not have been published.  I feel you have to be an anglophile to appreciate this book 
 Song writing - 5 stars all the way Roger never a doubt. Here is the thing and it's just one mans opinion. You don't have a strong enough voice to sing lead vocals. Your strength in harmony is undeniable, your strength in song writing is undeniable, your skill as a musician is second to none. You just don't have what is needed to fill the role of lead vocalist. That is the only thing that will keep this release from the ears of all who unfortunately will never get to appreciate it 
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 unlike the set from last year that was great!!... these have a cheap feel and a thiner and bendable blade they do not even carry the Laguiole name on the blade now.  not worth the money.   came in a  broken box that was pieces of two or three others that would not fit together.   a pure wast 
 Franken is a DLC Democrat and he really believes we can prevail in Iraq. This is his biggest downfall, he and other DLC Democrats must realize when a war is lost.  Only peace can be negotiated 
 First off, Starship Troopers is one of my top ten books period.  Well done Mister Heinlein.  This book?  In a word--UGH!   The dialogue is laughable at times, noxious at others, and sometimes entertaining enough to keep you reading to see what comes next.  Sometimes what comes next is plausible and exciting and entertaining.  Sometimes it is none of those.  And at one point, it's jaw-droppingly shocking and nauseating:            Main male character, former military officer, is someone you learn to like a lot as you read through the book.  Until you suddenly find out he's bisexual around page 300.  And had a homosexual experience he didn't find unpleasant with a Boy Scout Leader when he was a kid.  Thanks for springing that on us just before the end.    Bottom line:  Do not recommend.  But Starship Troopers--get 2 copies...one to read, one to lend out 
 Purely on the merit of hearing one of their fab early singles on the radio, I took a risk and bought this album hoping for more of the same. Save track 5, what I found however was a real horror story of a let down- an atypical sterile eighties sound barely redeemed by the intermittently thought provoking lyrics. A poor mans Smiths, I consider this group to be the most over rated 'under rated' band of the eighties and regard said album as personal insult to a purhaser who spent three hours flipping burgers in a hot sweltering kitchen to pay for it 
 As a Muslim woman who covers herself, or is "veiled," we are in no need to find the truth -- we have the truth and that is Islam.   I don't know why others are so hellbent on trying to convert those who follow the fastest growing religion in the world. Maybe because the authors and Sara the dreamer, are insecure with their own faith.   Nowhere in Islam does it encourage forcing religion down someone's throat, yet in Christianity, you can't find a place without some missionary forcing food and the Bible on some child in a hungry city in Bangladesh.   It's actually quite sad when you have no faith of your own and thus prove it by using all your energy to try to change others. Why don't the authors use their energy to become better Christians and leave Muslims alone?  I work with Christians and Jews, agnostics, and atheists and I have never had a problem. No one has tried to convert me, nor have I tried to convert anyone. I show my religion by my actions and vice versa.   Many good people I know are Christians, please stop making them look bad. 
 I purchased this camera right before we had our first child. Needless to say, I would have rather donated the money to charity! The flash recovery time is ridiculously slow, but that I can live with. The 4 out of every 5 pictures that come out blurry, I can not. Now I have a photo album of blurry baby pictures that we can reflect on. Needless to say I think we will try a different brand when we purchase our next camera 
 I have had nothing but problems out of mine. first off, the screen went out due to a factory defect only 3 months after buying, got it fixed, and went out agian. I just took the piece of junk nad threw it away. I wouldnt waist my time with it. 
 I was hoping for something with easy recipes that the whole family could enjoy together, but this is not it. A lot of the recipes are really unsuited for babies, and they instead give "baby" versions at the end that consist of reserving one of the ingredients (e.g., brown rice) and pureeing it plain--not exactly nutritious. (These are often followed by "children's" versions that necessitate picking out selected ingredients that may--or may not--appeal to kids.) There are too many grain-based recipes for my taste (deep-fried millet croquettes...red bean quinoa chili) and a lot of nuts (bad for babies), sea vegetables and permutations of soy (tofu, tempeh, tamari) which I personally am not interested in serving due to all the recent scrutiny of soy products as hormone disruptors (also a possible allergen for babies). It is really sort of an Asian-inspired/macrobiotic vegetarian cookbook (Tempeh Bacon is one of the recipes). "Whole Foods," in my mind, should feature fresh, minimally processed, natural, localized ingredients, but this seems to require endless trips to the health food store to purchase products such as seitan and kudzu. There is a lot of great nutritional information at the beginning of the book discussing babies and breastfeeding mothers, and some seemingly good sugar-free desserts, but I am sort of disappointed that the majority of the recipes are not palatable for the whole family (or easily modifed so that older babies can enjoy what everyone else gets). 
 Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist.  He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution.   His retelling of the Divine Comedy, which appears to be based on earlier translations, is reasonably accurate and readable.  The problem comes with his notes.  They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive.  Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications.  This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as "that most heinous of sins".   And there are other similarly personal and inappropriate remarks. This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally of tune with Dante, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD.  There are many superior translations out there.  Mandelbaum's is excellent and has good notes.  Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and informative of all.  What the Modern Library had in mind when commissioning this translation, which is neither scholarly nor distinguished as poetry, remains a mystery. 
 This is an unbelievably bad book. "Unbelievable" is the correct word. Lunn has trouble with sentences and paragraphs with a single subject are quite beyond him. Logical flow of thought does not occur either. Worse, as a "historian," he accepts as facts, concepts which are in great dispute or have no documentary evidence (too many to mention, but start with Mary Magdalene in France and even the existence of Arthur in England). Try another source for decoding 
 As an enthusiastic student of chado and the Japanese arts in general, I bought this book thinking I would learn something new about wabi and/or sabi. Simultaneously I also purchased the Koren book Wabi-Sabi: for Artists, Designers, Poets and Philosophers. In an oddly disturbing way, both books have uncanny similarities in their conceptual and pictorial approaches--except that the Koren book is vastly more insightful, more beautiful, and was written nine years earlier! What's going on 
 I don't mind using bisquick or jiffy mixes but packaged soup mixes and canned soup have so much sodium.  I'd have preferred to see use of fresh ingredients, they don't take long to prepare 
 ok they either have the wrong description or the wrong photo/title. the review is for Invasion of the Boy Snatchers. com'on people!!!XP only 1 star for the idiots at amazon.                                                               
 Wild Card is the best song on this cd.  The rest just didn't do it for me and I didn't care for the Latin flavor.  This cd was a mess.  If the rest of the songs were along the lines of Wild Card, I would have kept the cd.  This didn't say Rippingtons to me. 
 I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars.  If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him 
 Aries Spears is cool, but I guess that I set my expectations too high for this one...I should have bought "I Ain't Scared" instead...I'll be selling this one immediately 
 I have a few concerns with the words Willie Jolley writes and speaks.  Never quote the bible then talk about going out and doing all you can to make more money. Do you really believe Jesus condones the desire to gain "worldly" things Willie? You talked the entire time about your riches and have the nerve to quote proverbs...   I have a little tip for you Willie, when you write or speak, don't use Microsoft  / Bill Gates as examples of success. You do know that they were found guilty in a court of law numerous times of illegal practices to get where they are right? They lie, steal, and cheat to get ahead.  Will you be endorsing Martha Stewart and Enron next? Maybe use Tyco or Halliburton as an example of how to succeed and make loads of money.  I have a little tip for you too Willie, maybe a little something you can throw in your speeches or possibly your next book: Tell the people you talk to, that no matter how much money they get, that in life, happiness is what really counts. Just, do something everyday that makes you smile. You don't have to brainwash yourself by repeating affirmations of "I am happy" 800 times a day. You don't have to force yourself to be a type-a personality. You don't have to climb the corporate ladder of achievement to have a wonderful fulfilling life. No Willie, all you need is to accept you for who you are, and strive to be happy. I smile everyday. I don't have to brainwash myself to get there.  You're either the bee or the windshield? Too bad life isn't so black and white as to only be reduced to such.  I say, seek out the fields of flowers and avoid the highway altogether.  
 I bought this book for my Numerical Analysis class.  It proves theorems very un-rigorously.  I've only seen the first 3 chapters so far, but a frequent phrase that comes up is "and by the results that we will show in Chapter 6, (statement) is true" 
 Please please please don't belive hardly ANYTHING this author tells you about the "ancient history of celtic handfasting". All of this God/Goddess duality is GREAT for Wiccans, but please please don't believe that that is how the "ancient Celts" actually practiced and worshiped. We have hardly ANY evidence for the prehistoric Celts, and what we have is skewed, slanted, and possibly even misinterpreted (archaeological evidence is VERY difficult to interpret). The author does a decent job of giving you things to think about for planning your wedding (such as date, place, altar objects, etc) but I wouldn't say that she does a super job of anything, really 
 This was a very disappointing entry in the Doc Ford series. I would like to be more specific, but I read it two months ago (why does Amazon wait so long to solicit reviews?) and have read several dozen other books since then--all of which I have enjoyed much more than I did Dark Light. 
 I didn't feel that this was his best work.  I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes.  Too much detail on mundane stuff.  Suspense picked up on Tape 6, but wasn't the same type of suspense like "PREY".  Enjoyed it, but would've liked more suspense 
 Ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up. I first bought the book, 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on, so i bought the audiobook (5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on).  Now im stephen kings No1 fan and have loved the majority of his work, the talisman for me was a fantastic bolt on to the dark tower quest. So naturally i thought this would be the same. The book is one of the slowest drawn out books ive ever came accross, not a patch on previous work. I forced myself through the book expecting more, and im sorry to say this one doesnt deliver on any horror, excitment etc, do yourself a favour, get a tin of paint and watch it dry - more happens in that and at a much quicker pace than it does in this book. This book is for die hard fans only... but even diehards will find this a chore 
 Maybe I grew up on the wrong side of the Mason-Dixon line (that would be north of Jackson, Mississippi) to appreciate the humor in this book, but I didn't find it all that funny.  With the exception of a few ancedotes this book was disappointing and did not live up to the rave reviews I'd heard about it.  Some of the advice handed out in this book was good (I agree with the author regarding toupees on men).  A couple of the anecdotes were side-splittingly funny (such as the one about the Queens most-prepared woman award).  Even a couple of the comfort-food recipes sounded good (the chocolate pudding in particular).  But overall this comes off as just a bunch of frustrated women over-40, who need therapy because they never got majorette boots as children.  Personally, I had a difficult time finishing this book and don't care to read any of the subsequent books that have been written by Ms. Browne.  As she explains how the Queens came to be, she attempts to draw you in with some "good girl talk" to make you feel part of the gang.  The author turned me off with her definition of the Sweet Potato Queens as an exclusive sorority with it's group of wannabes, who supposedly grovel and beg to become a Queen.  Give me a break!  Even if this was meant to be funny, it wasn't. It was just pathetic.  My good, sound advice to you on this book -- save your money and don't buy it.  
 I never quit reading books. I could see how this story would be confusing and hard to understand. I was able to keep up with the reading and understand it, but it was just plain boring. This book I just wasn't into. I didn't look foward to reading it. So I didn't finish it. Morrison jumped around to much.. once I started getting familiar with characters, she would switch it up. I don't know how it ever ended, but I wasn't patient with the book to find out 
 Dr. Richard Lert, not "Dr. Hans Lert," was the long-time conductor of the Pasadena Symphony. He conducted Keel in a Handel oratorio (not "aritorio," as is stated twice). When Keel was performing in London in the mid-1940s, "Robert Donat dined with a lovely actress named Catherine Deneuve." Ms. Deneuve was born in 1943. The first (U.S.) 3-D movie was not "Kiss Me Kate," as stated, but was "Bwana Devil."  I gave up halfway through when I realized that I could no longer trust what I was reading. 
 As a major Ja Rule fan i was very disappointed when i bought this c.d..  i bought this c.d because i had the last c.d pain is love and that was good so i tryed this one and now i regret it. i dont even think it's worth listening to. this c.d. was so bad that it mad me stop buying real c.d's before i listen so now i get burned copies. it's not even worth burning.  the c.d gets 2 stars  1 for effort and 1 since im a fa 
 The examples in this book were too advanced for the project I was working on. In the end it was just a waste of time. I wish I'd spent my money on a book more suitible to my needs. Nuff said 
 Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.  
 Having read only brief publications about TR, I can only claim partial qualification for this review. That said, I found this book to be highly insulting and disrespectful to the memory of Theodore Roosevelt. The author paints a picture of a man that was emotionally disturbed at best. How can she come to such far fetched conclusions when she has never even spoken to the man? The analytical process the author uses is  abstract. Nearly every page is filled with modern feminist language that I found to be very out of place in a book that is supposed to be about an important American icon.  I'm truly sorry and ashamed that I even picked up this book, let alone read it. This is revisionism at it's most rank. 
 I can't beleive this guy's arrogance to try and re-record songs that are essentially and always will be Sinatra's domain. Any idiot will tell you that once Sinatra got hold of a song it was and always will be identified with him. Fact. Ask Tony Bennett or any other great singers and they will tell you. Sinatra IS the voice and then this upstart thinks he can do better. Not only does he murder 'a very good year' but also attempts (badly) 'mr. bojangles' even attempting to ape Sammy Davis's mannerisms. I had the misfortune to hear this once and came to the conclusion that is was a)a joke or b) a blantant attempt by Williams to crossover to boarder appeal. Now i see it actually meant it. Robbie you will never be able to sing standards and please don't attempt the Rodgers and Hart songbook (though i suspect you will if your latest album bombs) your voice is flat most of the time and your attempts to look cool on the cover can't cover up your mediocrity. The only time i'd like to see you swing is from a lamppost. Stick with 'songs for swinging lovers''come fly with me' to hear the real thing. An insult to classic songs 
 There are a few gems here, but for the most part, these essays are the same well-written but dry, uninventive slop every other high school senior dribbles out: how the abroad student haf a Life Changing Experience! how an athlete Crossed the Finish Line! how when pet Fluffly croaked it was a Formative Experience! If you really want insight into how to write a well-crafted, unique essay, with sounds suggestions, seek out the great book by Harry Bauld 
 Gerd Ludemann writes, "historical research shows with definite clarity that Jesus was not raised from the dead...we must acknowledge...a worldwide historical hoax", (190). A summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support.  Three streams of thought permeate "The Resurrection of Christ": gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish, invent, or explain away; Peter and Paul experienced hallucination and "vision" experiences proceeding from self-deception; belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific. Each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions, or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter-Christian polemic.   In his chapter "Translation and analysis of the Early Christian texts on the Resurrection", Ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles "purpose and tradition reworked" (re. Gospel writers), and "historical elements". In the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic, or perhaps (he intimates) to cover up some element of embarrassment. For example, Ludemann asserts that we may conclude that Joseph of Arimathea was a member of the Jewish Council (which condemned Jesus), but that Mark (earliest gospel) "likely" invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of God and had become a disciple of Jesus. But Ludemann needs to discredit such notions, for all four gospel writers record Joseph as the rich council member that buried Jesus in his own tomb. Ludemann's case will be much weaker if Jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances. Ludemann gets carried away with himself when he, in tabloid fashion, suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to "disinfect a tradition...of a dishonorable burial" of Jesus. This is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze. Ludemann goes so far as to accuse Matthew, Mark and Luke of being anti-Jewish! (Refer to the ridiculous Appendix 3).  Is Christianity a "history of self deception"? Ludemann invests in the rather high-risk prospect of hallucination; for the burden is on Ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of Jesus available in the New Testament. That any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid. Ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence. 1 Corinthians 15 is the New Testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of Jesus' multiple appearances. Even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text (vs. 3-5) to the early 30's AD. The discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection, three physical events. Also, the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of Jesus eating and offering his body for examination, as well as being hugged! Ludemann though, convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above, and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions, introduces hallucination. What accounts for these hallucinations? "Peter's vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning" (165). Paul's "event had a character of light and, like the vision of John, happened in the spirit, i.e., in ecstasy" (47). But Paul does not report "I was in the Spirit" as John does (see Revelation 1). John is deliberately conveying a non-physical experience. Paul is not. When Paul does have opportunity to convey an actual "in the spirit" experience, he does so in terms appropriate to that experience (2 Corinthians 12:2). So we have record of Paul's ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual. Ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages "modern depth psychology" to explain Paul's conversion from zealous persecutor of Christians to "Apostle-in-Chief of a new program of salvation" (170-171). So, we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of Paul's subconscious state, than from the widely accepted facts of Jesus death, burial, empty tomb and appearances!   Ludemann's examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural. Historians look for the best explanation of the evidence. Yet Ludemann writes, "Who decides at what point of historical study a `theological explanation' ought to begin" (201). This is rife with misunderstanding. One need only confirm that an event occurred in history, regardless of theological implications.  Also, simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism (thus supernaturalism) is an entirely logical proposition. Yet Ludemann quotes another author, "[the disciples] believed in phantoms; ... imagined that they were surrounded by miracles; ... took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time." (175). This ignores the New Testament textual evidence that initially Jesus' disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened, and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works. Even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle!   Ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with Paul that if there is no resurrection, we should abandon Christianity. Sadly, he reaches the wrong conclusion. Self deluded by a proliferation of "one can imagine", "seems to indicate", "likely enough", and "one thus suspects" reasoning, Ludemann boasts "accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer Easter vision". (210). May the reader decide otherwise 
 To listen to an obviously unhappy man about how to be happy 
 It would seem that this book has not been updated in some time since The Blue Man Group hasn't been performing at Luxor for over a year 
 Be warned - this book is over 600 pages long and every character is a talking cadaver.  Yes, there are seven narrators, but, as many critics have noted, their voices meld into one - this lack of differentiation undermines the basic intent of the novel. Instead of being in the company of seven different characters, I felt I was in the company of a single person, the author - and he wasn't feeling that great.  The book reads as a dreary confession, one that would have any self-respecting psychiatrist reaching for his prescription pad.   * There is far less ambiguity here than you might imagine, and in more ways than one.  A change in perspective never overturns any basic fact about the plot or, more surprisingly, regarding a character's motivations - rather than being akin to Rashomon, where each view radically conflicts with its neighbour, here the narrators simply take turns telling the same undisputed story.  This lack of conflict between their vantages leads to a lack of tension; and in itself deprives the voices of individuality.  Yes, one character can see things which another can't, but it's more a case of adding to the overall picture, instead of actually angrily erasing and painting over the space.   * The rhythm of the sentences varies little from chapter to chapter.  This is not Faulkner.  The vocabulary is similarly uniform (as an example, "perfunctory" and "insensate" are used by Angela, while for Joe it's "obfuscate" - these being the two allegedly less educated characters).  The characters all achieve a similar level of insight into, and reflection upon, themselves. Perhaps most disappointing is the chapter voiced by Simon, the literary minded precipitant of events.  For all his alleged passion for poetry, his writing is bland and his references to literature rather limited - his voice does not breathe life into the bones of his character.  The dialogue is poorly written - in most chapters it would be difficult to tell who is speaking without prompts, and the overall tone is awkward and dead; perhaps the Dennis Mitchell chapter escapes this criticism. * The two prime female characters are drawn as stereotypically beautiful.  We are carefully informed about the size of their breasts, and the allure of their eyes.  In intellectual matters, they respectfully defer to their male superiors, be this the soulful stuff of art, or the technicalities of card-counting in blackjack.  Yawn.  There's not much evident irony in Perlman's choice of such representations.  When Anna reveals that: "He played me like a musical instrument", I had to check the cover to make I sure I wasn't reading Judith Krantz.  If parts of the book read with the flattened affect of an airport novel it could be because his characters, and his handling of them, share many qualities.  Then there's is the central issue of Simon's obsession with Anna - the narcissism inherent in this is impressive, but its exploration is limited - it might be raising the standard too high, but Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina' shows how multi-faceted such an exploration can be. * Perhaps, more than reading the book itself, it's interesting to ask why so many people found it so stimulating.  The very flatness of the style does make it easy to read.  The attempt to begin a meditation on character by invoking childhood influences, adult relationships, and unpredictable events, is, as everyone says, ambitious.  It could be that the analysis proceeds at a depth which is comfortable for most readers - it allows fractions of honesty to become visible, while a veil remains over much.  Of course, fractions can add up to a sizeable sum.  My overall reaction to the book was negative, and reminded me of the mood created by reading books by Richard Powers - both authors construct plots which shape a superficial interest, and pen characters with surface complexities, but the crucial insight required for true empathy to be established is missing, as is a winning sense of humour.  At best this is a novel I might admire, but not one that I could love 
 With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult comes down a level in terms of quality.  Rather than narrowing the scope and developing it well, this novel is a pinball machine of ideas, people and issues that never come together.  I kept holding out for an ending that would redeem the rest of the story but was disappointed till the final word 
 I will join in with the others that this book is highly dangerous, misleading,unscientific and just plain awful. I cringe when I see it on a counselor's bookshelf.This book has almost certainly done more harm than good.Please seek professional help before turning to this book 
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 Normally, Lonely Planet is hands down the best in travel guidebooks and literature. When LP published "The Cities Book" recently they reversed that trend. Once again the liberal writers have found every possible opportunity to take shameless cheap shots at conservatism not just in the US this time but in just about every country in the world. The pro and cons are great for a 60's gay, pot-smoking, big business protesting, secular, Green peace loving, socialist, tree hugging, anti-Christian, vegan hippy. Of course everyone agrees that meat hardy meals are a big con for restaurants but yet vegan friendly. This is coming from the same book which lists cultural traditions as a pro but traditional dishes (heaven forbid they have meat) are a con. Just tell a third world country, "Your thousand year traditions are a pro but as long as they fellow our loony liberalism". The writers should just say patriotism is unacceptable for any country to have. Sarajevo lists "nationalism" as a con. Luxembourg lists a con of "conservative attitudes". These are not true pros or cons at all but more of the personal disagreements of each city's public opinion .  Would it really matter to a the world  traveler whether or not we know about Lonely Planet's personal political views? How about listing some pros and cons about it city that are actually relevant towards visiting or living there?  The only surprising aspect of the entire book is that Amsterdam is not rated #1. Who would of thought the worldwide Mecca for liberals didn't receive enough praise following the theme in which this book is written. If you don't believe me look at a pro for Amsterdam; "Liberal attitudes(world's first homosexual marriage and legal euthanasia). Of course! We all agree that is a tremendous pro for a city to have. Thank god I know Amsterdam legalized euthanasia, that is really going to come in handy when I visit. Although Amsterdam does get a gold star for "Liberal attitudes", surprisingly it is not #1 for the Lonely Planet publishers. The authors are quite simply too blinded by their own ideology to produce an honest book about the great cities of the world.  Would this book be a good educational reference for children? Highly doubt it. The pictures are full of nude sunbathers, topless women painted in "body art", transvestites, and people drinking at a bar on every other page. Is that really the best photos you can find that would represent a famous city that has so much more to offer?  From the laughable pros and cons to the complete butchery of  some great cities such as Austin. Out of all the pictures of the great city of Austin all LP could come up with is a picture of "where will the chicken poop", someone eating chicken, a dog fashion show, and a women getting a tattoo on her thigh.   By the end of reading "The Cities Book" you can move on to "Das Kapital" next. Read between the lines not so carefully and you will see the anti-capitalism all over the pages. The Havana page shows a man with Hugo Chavez and a shackle and hammer captioned with "A cool commie shows off his true colors". "The Cities Book" is a clear attempt to discredit cities who do not share the same liberal ideological views as the publishers and want us readers to have the impression that that city is "bad" or has many negative aspects because of it. Point overall else is; this book is very laughable from Pros & Cons to the pictures "representing" each city. Don't waste your time or money unless you choose to see the world through Howard Dean's eyes and not from your own.  
 I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help 
 I picked this up after seeing Bookslut cite it as one of the year's best reads.  The brief premise for the book sounded ok so I took a gamble.  Half way through the book, which was pathetically slow going, the only "thin" thing going on is the plot. Not that there is one.  Davis seems to get some major names dropped in-line with hers, so maybe -although doubtfully, I'm missing something. Or maybe she just swung and missed (big time) with this particular novel and her previous work is (at least) good. Although I'm not excited to give it a try based on this vapid effort. The occasional well written line and almost vaguely interesting characters (with no story though) but hardly worth a gamble. Or a dead tree.   All in all an unreadable book that is hardly the best of anything, let alone a stand-out for a year's worth of books. Try Simon Ings' _The Weight of Numbers_ for the *easy* winner of that prize. 
 It should have been titled, Making the Most of Harvard: Students Speak Their Minds.  We were required to read this book for an English writing class.  Some of the suggestions in the book are helpful, like time management and getting help if you are not scoring well but only if you read this book *before* you go to college.    Light makes suggestions that may not be feasable, including finding a class with very few students because it will be benificial.  Our class also felt that Light's suggestion of picking roomates according to race is ludicrous.  
 At first we loved it. Then it began to jam. When we cleared the pepper, it worked for a while and then jammed again. Early on I had bought six for Christmas presents. I haven't heard from the recipients. I hope their's work better than mine. V.T. Abercrombi 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 I can't tell you how happy I was to finally find Temple Bar!!!  I haven't stopped listening to this CD!  It's a shame that the record company at the time didn't promote it properly.  This CD is simply AWESOME!  There isn't a bad song on it, this is definately John Waite at his best 
 The mexican cartels absolutely wouldn't have allowed this  guy living on the border to exist in their territory as it  relates to grass smuggling.In Nuevo Laredo and Laredo,Tx. their have been 170 drug territory related killings year to date. This isn't even close to logical.Further,if his ranching business was broke and the bankers were knocking he could not have been anything more than a petty grass-runner.The mexicans have plenty of these types.With no money--you're a mule.This is however good fiction reading.The mexicans-including ''El Chapo'' of the Gulf cartel would laugh at this one.An individual cowboy on the Mexican border that is broke?C'mon.Mexicans fiercely protect their business.FICTION!Anyone who knows anything about this business knows that this story just ain't happening 
 Whatever felicity Edwards manages in this work, do not credit the ideas represented to Edwards himself.  All of his central points on freedom are no more than a Christian appropriation of secular English philosophy in Hobbes, somewhat in Locke, and certainly of David Hume.  In the old philosophy, choice is an illusion, because in any course of action we are determined necessarily by our nature; Edwards agrees fully, adding only that our nature gets some extra help from God when it comes to sanctification.      He advances the idea that in every snapshot of human life, we make decisions in accordance with our nature and disposition.  Free will is compatabilist in that we have no autonomy other than to follow our greatest desire in any given instance.  Not only does this exposition rule out the chance for true virtue--some good thing we do which we might not have done--but Edwards also has a hard time explaining how God is not the author of evil, given that human decisions are consistently determined according to a divine decree 
 ~I bought the MVSV3-1m cable and put it between my Pioneer V555 DVD player and SONY WEGA tv KV-27FS12, I was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality, color, sharpness. Same as the result as I used the composite cable came with the box. I really don't know why. I have to say, my TV is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even I don't use DVD player. Unfortunately my DVD player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience. I don't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one, I was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance. we just don't have a benchmark to evaluate it. 
 I don't think this title can qualify as a guidebook. It feels like it was written in a big hurry. Using it we found big holes. The advice in it is dated and there were so many discrepancies we had to buy another guide mid-vacation. Then our vacation took a big turnaround for the better.       Maui is a real beautiful place for a family vacation if you know where to go. The traffic was pretty bad but there are certain tricks for getting around all that 
 I found this book to be more high tech than possible for the average reader to understand.  It was not helpful at all 
 As part of a book club, I forced myself to read this book to the end.  It was so boring and drawn out.  I would speed read/skip to look for any interesting sections.  I personally found his descriptions of sex/romance practically repulsive.  I haven't read a male author in awhile.  It was a turn off 
 James has always produced until this album.  Laid is outstanding and their previous albums have more of a full connection, but this is definitely an attempt to assemble Booth's poignant lyrics with music...all in vain.  If  you like James and lyricist Booth, get the sheet and read that greatness 
 Although I'm very fond of all the music in the movie, and this isn't necessarily a bad CD, it could be a lot better. It lacks many of the live performances as well as many of songs featured in snippets in the background thoughout the movie. This disc does not contain even half of the music featured in the movie. 
 All the poems are smooth and clever and slightly (or more than slightly) ironic.  They sometimes make me smile, but they seldom make me feel much.    I was recently at a poetry reading Collins gave, where he was greatly applauded.  He mentioned that sentimentality is a cardinal sin in poetry.  That's true.  But I couldn't emotionally connect to the self-consciously witty voices speaking out of his poems, and by the end of this collection I didn't really want to.  When I first read Collins, I was hoping to find the accessible poet illuminating the everyday world I was promised.  Instead, I found an extremely polished poet whose engaging tone almost makes up for his persistent lack of emotional depth.  Sentimentality may be a poetic sin, but sincerity isn't.    Even funny poems should display a little emotional risk.  But Collins never seems to risk anything.  And because he takes small risks, we get small rewards.    Go ahead and get this book.  Read it.  Smile a bit.  Appreciate the cleverness and talent Collins displays.  These poems are likeable, and I wouldn't be surprised if you liked them.  But if you are looking for poetry that will feed you, go somewhere else 
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 I bought a 10-pack of TDK tapes in April, 2005 - The boxes say:  "TDK - SUPERIOR QUALITY - Standard T-120" - "VHS Standard Grade" - "Videotape for everyday and repeated use recording".  The tapes that do work so far, have grainy and blurry pictures and the colors are not vivid and the sound quality is horrible and distorted.  The packaging was not up to Amazon's standards.  The video tapes were not wrapped or protected inside the box and this is probably why I have at least 1 broken tape (plastic on cassette broke off).  They were not protected in the box at all.  I'm very disappointed with these video tapes.  Not sure if "TDK" is going down hill or if all the big name brand video suppliers are lowering their standards.  This was the first time in a few years that I bought new VHS tapes and they have the low quality I would expect in a generic no-name brand tape.  Since I need video tapes now, I was forced to order tapes from other companies.  I will be trying some other brands to see if TDK's standard tapes are the only brand name tapes lowering their standards.  I'm going to try some Maxell and RCA standard tapes and hope for better luck 
 I rented this movie because I like Luke Wilson and I was in the mood for a romantic comedy, but I was very disappointed. There's just about no chemistry between Wilson and Kate Hudson, and she was just terrible. Throughout the entire movie, I could practically see the acting wheels turning in her head--her portrayal as a somewhat prudish, somewhat mousy character was both unnatural and incredibly annoying. If not for her bad acting, I would have given this movie a higher rating, because it did have its funny and some sweet moments (if you can ignore the implausible plot). There just wasn't enough "good" to compete with Hudson's "bad. 
 ...but all the recipes come out very bland.  I've tried a few of them and there's really nothing that stands out.  I'll try a few more before I sell this one.  It's a shame, because the book is put together rather well and is easy to follow 
 I purchased this in June 2006. The software on the CD for viewing the jpg files is worthless. The documents included on the CD are in German with no translation. The book consists of a very detailed history of mostly german or dutch slide rule makers. Makers of very specialized rules. I did not find any discussion of makers of standard rules or methods for production of standard slide rules. If you want pictures of slide rules dealing with alcohol, aviation, concrete, artillery or loads and fuel reserve for planes, then this is the book. 
 As a Classics grad student, I have to say I do not recognize the Classics departments he describes in this book. The Classics scholars I know (and I've met many of them; it's a small field) are dedicated fair-minded scholars, not 'careerists.'   Furthermore, Classics was one of the first areas of the humanities to acknowledge the debt the West owes to the East (back before it was fashionable) and if Hanson thinks the venerated M.L West was some dippy postmodernist, he'll have to go through me.  Finally, Classicists have never gone wholesale for the New Historicism/cultural relativism that has paralyzed, say, academic English departments. The whole academic world needs to be dipped for these ticks, but Classics less than most.    I think Hanson is endorsing the same antique parody of the Classics field that our multicultural critics use against us: tweedy, irrelevant conservative white supremacists. Classics has not been like this since the days of Basil Gildersleeve. Classical scholars of the 20th century have achieved the difficult feat of balancing progressive ideas with sober scepticism, and they deserve some kudos for it.  Let's let Victor Hanson go duke it out with Martin Bernal, and let the rest of us go back to teaching, writing and keeping the flame alive 
 I felt like I was taking a piss on myself the whole time I listened to this album. What happened to the 40 water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1, 2pac, and mc breed? This clone of 40 raps with the likes of Lil jon (wack as hell), washed up 80 year old too short, and a bunch of losers I have never heard of. The album only gets props because eightball and mjg are on the album and ugk. And they almost played themselves by appearing on this god awful so called "album". E-40 has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk called "hyphy" in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless career. The album has some decent beats on it but there is no kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. E-40 wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Krs-One cd. This cd is wack simple and plain, Pee-40 is a beat waster, and he needs to find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!! 
 BEP was one of my favorite hip-hop acts of the late 90's. Their Debut album "Behind the Front" and even their Sophomore album "Bridging the Gap" continued a musical approach and ideology more akin to Tribe Called Quest, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, and the Roots than the current Gangster Rap trend.  After this however, BEP apparently figured out that they can make more money with intellectually depraved dance tracks than they can with original music. And it's a shame.  Money Business is a perfect example of an album crafted from bottom to top for pop appeal. In 2004 (with Elephunk) BEP left the Artistic music community and joined the commercial music community. It was sad to see them go 
 Save your money. These authors have better to offer, as does the science collective as a whole. Look elsewhere for insightful musings 
 First of all, the recipes in this book are NOT especially "quick and easy, so you can spend more time on the beach."  Most of them looked pretty time-consuming to me.  Secondly, they're all recipes that you probably already have:  Gazpacho, grilled shrimp, lobster rolls, mango salsa, pasta salads with chicken, lemon-glazed poundcake with berries, apple crisp...  I have to confess that I didn't try any of them (because nothing seemed the slightest bit new or original).  The recipes may work fine for all I know -- but I think that if you already have cookbooks like Barefoot Contessa, Silver Palate or any of the other classics, you really don't need this one 
 This book reads as if it were written in one marathon sprint, the plot racing from one bloody event to the next, with barely a pause for character development or background detail.  What could have been an intriguing novel of mercenary killers and political upheaval is instead a throwaway pulp crime novel 
 Other reviewers have given the story outlines so I won't waste time repeating them.    Suffice it to say, thank goodness I borrowed this from the library rather than spending actual money on it.  I have enjoyed Davidson's "Betsy" books over the years but these stories come no where near the level of those books.  Perhaps if each of the stories were longer and more developed - and eliminated a lot of the gratuitous sex - I might have enjoyed them better. As it is, I was not disappointed when I finished the book, only surprised that I had actually finished it 
 Wow... was I surprised after seeing all of the reviews... I hate this CD... It has to be the worst choice I've made in 5 years... this CD should have never been linked to any suggested site other than garbage.. Oops!! my bad.. I like the band Garbage... what a huge waste... huge.. 
 Marx'claims about the timing and the manipulative origins of nationalism do not quite fit the facts. I will show that one consequence of Marx's thesis may be a variant of Hugh Trevor Roper's view of  Hitler as a traditional European statesman. Viz., Hitler fostered German development toward an enlightened society [the Federal Republic?] by conjuring religious [/ethnic] disharmony to consolidate Nazi power. [Of course, as Sauer has shown about the Gauliter system, fascists aimed at a return to pre-modern, de- centralized, charismatic forms of organization. So not all nationalism serves a centralization aim.]  Marx's  mistaken thesis rests upon tendentious examples. Neo- [Karl] Marxists have maintained since mid- 2oth century that elites manipulated antecedent nationalism to achieve political cohesion against foreign enemies. T Marx merely takes the thesis that nationalism was manipulated [e.g., in WWI] to subvert class solidarity, next internalizes it to apply to intra-state cohesion, then projects this twisted commonplace backward as a sort of genetic fallacy. Rather,the most portentous exclusionary[eliminationist?] European nationalism was ultimately the Germanic variety. But its genesis (e.g., Herder, Goethe- the latter being the quintessence of liberalism qua Aufklarung] plainly predated any serious political centralization efforts beyond Joseph II's. Marx' move here must be to claim there since there was no nation-building before Bismarck, ergo the prior nationalist movement [e.g., resistance to Napoleon] does not qualify as nationalism of the right sort [did not culminate in liberal state?? but cf the Hitler rumination above]. Ergo, the German experience is disqualified as a counter- example and so cannot count as evidence against his statist incubation thesis. But dismissing this counter- example by disallowing it demonstrates that, at bottom, his thesis is a mere recommendation about how historians should use the honorific "modern nationalism". That is, his enterprise is revealed as attemppting to establish a stipulative definition of nationalism. It is not a historical account of nationlism's development. Alternatively, he must modify his conclusion so that royal centralization did not originate nationalism, but deformed it into his procrustean mold. But when did state- induced nationalism arise, even in German lands?      What about Marx' temporal claim that nationalism was the product of [royal] centralization in the early modern epoch?  The dynamic of centralization, particularly in France [but also in the Holy Roman Empire] began centuries before. It did not start with exclusionary cohesion/ religious factionalism in the 15th century, but with a conflict with the papacy in the 11th. The Investiture Contest with the Pope ostensibly concerned the king/ emperor's rights vs that of the Pontiff in nominating bishops to be invested with consecrated ecclesiastical -- and political/ temporal-- authority. As bishops were among the super- castellans of that feudal epoch, this effort to create a national church - one in liege service to central authority- was at least a progenitor of the nationalist phenomenon Marx attempts to explain. Not a mass movement, Marx objects?  Perhaps the later Reformation era factionalism mobilized and augmented the nationalism implicit in the 11th and intervening centuries. But nationalism was not the product of that later conflict 
 This may work well, but the cuff size is not as it is in the description. It says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches. Not even close. My arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far. Sure, you can get the cuff to go around your arm, but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly, and there was just no way to even come close 
 I can't believe this book was a finalist for the National Book Award! Although it was well written in the sense of grammar and vocabulary, it was not an effective vehicle to introduce readers to the subject. I live in Appalachia, and I feel this book in some way demeans the practices of these persons religion. It starts out with a reporter covering a murder trial where a "snake handler" forces his wife to be bitten in the hopes that she will die so he can have another woman. I would have loved the court dialog and more of a background of the alleged "crime."  I definitely would have found more background information on the snake handlers interesting, and also more information about the strychnine; where they get it, how they know ratio to mix with water, etc. Strychnine from churches around my home has been found to be "non-lethal" doses.   As it is, with it's wide margins and double/triple spacing I think it would have been better printed as a long article in the New York Times, for which Mr. Covington writes about the South 
 I was disappointed in this book. It was confusing in that the author tries to juggle too many lines of analysis at the same time. The lines that I could follow were helpful, but it read like a book whose pages had gotten mixed up and they couldn't remember what order to put them back in. Especially for a beginning player, this book will be confusing. It follows only one variation (Karpov's Be2 line for white) of the Najdorf. I was mislead by the content description to think that most variations would be covered to some extent. It was hard to finish.  
 This is just a REALLY bad book.  First I blame James Patterson, but I really REALLY blame his editor.  What editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published?    The villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains.  Just - over the top. The plot line is unbelievable.  Aside from Alex Cross and the two villains, nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever.  Alex Cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the FBI to foil the villains.  This is supposed to be one of those "the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world" type thriller but - there's no sense of urgency, and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched, and inept (but not deliberately written that way).  I could go on and on but it's not worth the words.  This book is REALLY a waste of time.  I can't believe anybody published it 
 The M-Audio Revolution 7.1 is listed as being Mac compatible but with all the issues it has currently, I am not sure how that is true.  I own a G4 Mirrored Drive Tower and have had nothing but problems with this sound card. Currently there is still no driver for anything past 10.4.6 and if you upgrade any higher the card will not work in Surround Sound. Besides that there is constant speaker popping and horrible buzzing and squeals when switching between programs, sometimes even when the computer is not in use. It has been flakey with surround sound when using DVD Player and Quicktime, as well. During the 10% of times it works without a hassle the sound is great through my Logitech speakers, so it is quite sad when it doesn't work. It seems that this is the only option for Mac users to achieve surround sound that I know of, which is also very saddening.  I have a feeling I will be selling this to a PC user in the near future and just settling for good ol'stereo 
 The centuries surrounding the beginning of the Second Christian Millenium are a relatively unknown time even among those, such as myself, with an interest in History.  The light that was shed on this time by the book was interesting to me, as were the concepts of Paris as a small town and Europe as a wilderness.  While some of the characters were interesting, the narrator spent too much time telling what was happening rather than showing it (i.e. through dialogue).  The made the book difficult to get throug, especially in the final chapters. *spoiler* The symbolism of the book was unclear as well, most especially the strange cottage to which the young black slave fled after stumbling on it.  I felt some of the sexual descriptions were gratuitous and unecessary and while the refusal of the author to give the wives names seemed to echo the tendendcy in the Bible to do the same to women, the Bible does give names to those who play an important role.  Although I disagree to the reveiwer that this was done with mysoginist intent.  Unfortunately the symbolism was either too subtle for the average reader or it completely missed the mark, and I lean toward the latter 
 Yes, the history of Maria's, tequila, and the margarita are interesting.  Some of the "tidbits" are also interesting and useful.  There's a foreward by Robert Redford to boot.  But the fact still remains, this book consists of one basic recipe repeated again and again and again.  And I don't buy the argument about the careful match of tequila to a liqueur. After reading the book, I couldn't shake the sneaking suspicion that I'd been had. If you're looking for some margarita recipes, search the internet and skip the book, I just don't believe it's worth the price 
 3 cups? I don't know where this teeny thing would equal that- not even 3 demitasse/espresso cups.  Amazon really should make the 'See larger image' say 'See life size' (try it)... or better yet show something for scale- like 10 coffee beans- the amount it holds.  So, I'm already kinda down on this Liliputian trinket and I check instructions to see if I can heat the water in the microwave- like I do with my other 'real size' French press (without the top).  No, nothing saying that should be a problem...  2 minutes later the rubber bottom mat is burning furiously in my microwave !  I'd hope Hugo had a 'BonJour' because I certainly didn't.. 
 This article is a reprint of a 1913 magazine piece written by Joshua L. Chamberlain to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Gettysburg.  While it's interesting to read his first hand depiction of the battle, all readers should note the story is approximately 15 pages long.  The publishers have tried to beef up the "book" by adding 15 additional pages of photos, but it does not make up for the lack of content.  I was very disappointed with the purchase 
 This book was a huge disappointment. Sue Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had been committed.  Save your eyesight! Do not bother picking up this book 
 Pierre Bourdieu is a tremendous intellect, and has produced far superior  work to this book.  _Distinction_ is a fascinating book, particularly for  those interested in French society.  Yet its relevance cannot really extend  to America, which has a markedly different system of class.  The French  have deeply entrenched class consciousness, in both a pragmatic sense and a  Marxist sense, whereas 90% of Americans consider themselves "middle  class."   	Bourdieu shows that the French are at pains to  symbolically express their class differences, and he does so with aplomb.   He compiles statistics and data which show ways in which the French produce  their own class position through consumption, education, and taste.   	      But his observations are less applicable to the vast American  "middle class."  Class mobility, education, and stylistic  expression are much more democratically distributed in America.  So while  many French are content with their class position, vocation, and  traditions, most Americans see themselves as "middle class,"  striving for better, and free from tradition.   	    _Distinction_ is  an interesting and accesible book, but those looking for Bourdieu's  contributions to social theory will be better served by some of his other  works 
 Well, I would like to give this duet of horror stories two-and-a-half stars - almost three. It's not bad. But it just didn't make much of an impression on me.  The first story, "Incident On and Off a Mountain Road" is like a video-game version of the excellent horror film "Wolf Creek." In fact, it seems to land the heroine in a torture shed setting almost identical to the one used in Wolf Creek.   However unlike Wolf Creek, which has a sort of terrifying inevitability to it, this story has - I wouldn't say a twist ending - but a turn-the-tables sort of ending. But that's not enough to bring it up to the level of a really good horror movie. The villain here is an unrealistic, cartoonish figure. And the action devolves into pure gore fest.  "Chocolate," the second story on this DVD, is a little more imaginative and intriguing. But again, another movie does it better. In this case, Chocolate's theme is trumped by the 1970's movie, "The Eyes of Laura Mars."  So there are worthwhile things about this diptych of thrillers. But if you feel the press of limited time and limited life, better to just watch "Wolf Creek" and "The Eyes of Laura Mars," which come off as classics in comparison. 
 I'm a fan of anything Nick Bantock and had looked forward to this one for quite a while. I even ordered it early, to get it as soon as it was released. The story starts off being readable and interesting, with quite a few sensual moments, but the ending is a huge let-down. It also does not have the usual images I've come to expect from a Bantock book. Some of them felt recycled from previous works and none of them had much to do with the story. They just sort of made the pages pretty, if you can even claim that. I'd much rather read The Venetian's Wife for the fifth time, than read this one (again) 
 Having received this book as a gift, I opened it hoping for a lot. What I had was a lot of annotations for many obvious words, as well as editorial interpretaions that I feel are limited and incomplete, indicating that the editor is unfamiliar with Austen scholarship. JANE AUSTEN FOR DUMMIES teaches you a lot more about ALL of Austen's novels 
 The power connector on my FS108 is very sensitive - try to shift the unit or move the power cord in any way and it goes into a fit, flashing all lights and all connected devices indicate they have lost their network connection. My friend reports the same problems with his. Mine is being relegated to the spares drawer as soon as I purchase a replacement - not another Netgear. A shame, it is otherwise a nice switch 
 This was purchased as part of a gift for my brother-in-law for Christmas. We gave it to him with several other small items, but I don't think he was impressed, and I don't think he used it. The kit itself is a small one, like the kind you find in bookstore check out lines and would make a much better stocking stuffer or easter basket accent than a real gift. I would not have picked it out if I had realized it's size 
 I order a book (interplay)from this person about 5 months ago, and I still do not have my book. This person still not even giving me back my money !!!!!!!! 
 In terms of vitalism spiritism supernaturalism, I particularly enjoy this line: "the organic foods you eat have a spirit of their own, one that will blend with your spirit and strengthen and empower your vital force [p.354]."  This one is good too:  "when the right herb is selected [...] its vital life force works synergistically with that of the patient [p.004]."  Maybe this is my favorite: "a plant, which is a living and breathing entity, has the ability to understand and work in synchrony with the body's internal needs, in harmony with the vital force within us, to heal and give life [p.094]."  Generally, 'like curing like,' 'as X' curing 'X,' is known as sympathetic magic (SM).  These quotes are of the vitalistic spiritistic supernaturalistic (VSS) herbalistic strain of sympathetic magic (VSSHerbSM).  As apposed to the homeopathic strain (VSSHomSM).   -rc 
 Don't be fooled by the cover of this book. Trudeau's real mission in his comic strip is to play politics with the president. You would definetely know this if you have read a biography or encyclopedia article about him. Playing politics with his own personal white whale (George W. Bush) has been the aim of his comic strip, Doonesbury, which he generally uses for political purposes. This is what he has done for the past twenty years, since the Reagan administration.   And also consider the fact that while I am sympathetic to those who have lost loved ones in the Iraq War, I do not think that we should give up. The 2,500 Americans who have died in Iraq does not equal up to the 12,000 who died in the Revolutionary War, the 620,000 Americans who died in the Civil War, the 116,000 Americans who died in World War I, the 400,000 who died in World War II, and the 60,000 who died in Vietnam. These men died for the freedom of America, even though they really didn't deserve to die so young. It is so shameful why people would want to use such a tragedy for political gain.      
 This novel deserves 5 stars.  I was given 44 Scotland Street as a Christmas gift. I assumed it was a "detective story" given the author's previous well known work. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the book was like nothing else I have ever read.  I have lived in Scotland and have visited Jenner's department store in Edninburgh, as well as some of the other landmarks mentioned in the book. I can assure readers who have not been to Edinburgh that the descriptions and the characterizations are very real, for example, the rivalry between Edinburgh and Glasgow.  Although it may be difficult for non-Scots to fully appreciate certain elements of the book, the characters can be found practically anywhere and in any time. For example, the narcissistic Bruce and the class-conscious Sasha. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and especially homesick Scots.  I can hardly wait for the sequel 
 1.They run extremely small. I wear a ladies med.. I ordered a man's small which I normally "swim" in and these are skin tight. 2. Then, they shrank on low heat, damp dry. I gave them to my 11 year old granddaughter. 3. Even though they are called "Heavy Weight" they are light weight at best and not even heavy enough to keep away the chill on an Arizona winter day.  
 I am building my own house and find myself frequently referring to this book. There is much useful information; I only wish it were more up-to-date. It was published 12 years ago, but much of the info was out dated even then. And plumbing isn't exactly a rapidly changing field. The sad thing is that there aren't really any books out there that are much better. There is some info that is just plain wrong. I followed the book's instruction to use 45's to keep my sewer line from sloping more than 1/2" per foot, at great effort and expense... turns out it is not required, just an old plumber's legend. Be careful about following any of the advice in this book. Does anyone still use cast iron or copper dwv pipe? The book specifies a Kelly fitting for cleanouts. Is there any code which still allows that? Can you even buy a Kelly fitting? Most houses in the faster growing parts of the country are slab-on-grade and have been for years, but this book only devotes a few pages to this "new" concept. If you buy this book you need to be aware that much about plumbing is regional and code specific, and much of this book was out of date before it was published. It can still be a good source of info if you keep that in mind. 
 I can't imagine anyone wanting to write a book about this man.He was nothing but a vulgar,lazy,lying alcoholic.Half of the things that he says are nothing but B.S.For instance,Chicago police officers murdering suspected gangsters @ black men for 200$ a pop.I could go on @ on but you should get the idea.Save your money.As for me, I am going to line my cats litter box with my copy 
 I bought this DVD in september, 2006. But I have never received it 
 I think it would have been better in print, some of the concepts are hard to follow on tap 
 Aidoo gives new meaning to the term "female whiner". Her brief "novel"(about 132 pages) is a trying exercise in whining about being a woman, and being an African. She may have cause to whine, but please spare us the long poems that break up the text. If I wanted to read poetry, I'd buy a poetry book. I hate it when authors insert poems in midstream. It breaks up the text, and detracts from the action. Anyway, Sissie is a Ghanaian who visits Germany, makes cute with a German woman, and reflects on how bad colonization and Africans can be. Not recommended except for insommiacs 
 It is already the 15th of September and as of yet i have still not received this book. I e-mailed the bookseller and i am waiting for his response. 
 I am not a fan of this book. He begins by saying Do not use complicated words when a simple one will do. Then he continues by using complicated words throughout the entire book. He proceeds by telling the reader to do everything they were told not to do: use "I" and start sentences with "but." He is the only person I have heard of that is pro "I" and I refuse to do poorly on future essays because he likes it whereas no one else does. Much of his style is completely subjective--he doesn't explain well why he likes some phrases and dislikes others. One thing I'm sure of, no matter what I'd write, he'd hate it, including this review. In my opinion, the author can be described by words he uses frequently in the book: pompous and utterly (he'd say that word is unecessary but oh, I think it is) pretentious 
 I have only used it once and it broke (made out of cheap plastic)! It for sure is a "one time use only" and the way it is shown on TV is not the way you really use it, not so smoothly - I think they have used an already chopped onion. I would say it is better for soft vegetables such as tomatoes (which also is very messy because of the juice). It was just a waste of money. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
 I was very disappointed with this film.  I had hoped to learn about the "Birth of a Nation" and "prenatal" life in the region.  But the entire film is about postnatal fighting.  The film is appropriate for people who find fighting to be glorious - for people who like to keep score of battles and casualties like some kind of sports game.  This ugly film depicted the entire society as being barbaric.  In fact it sanctified the barbarism as being something heroic.  Surely the beautiful people and the rich culture of this region deserve more than this.  Surely the viewers deserve more than this History Channel pandering.  
 It is handy to have such a tremendous number of quick breads in one book; this one has more recipes for quick breads than all my other cookbooks put together. Just flip to the chapter you want and leaf through all the recipes until you find one that suits you.  Unfortunately, I am not confident enough in the reliability of the recipes as a whole to recommend it. Interesting, but best avoided.    The author claims to have tested each recipe, but I doubt the veracity of this statement. It almost seems as if this book did not have an editor at the publisher. This is definitely a case where quantity trumps quality (I would be happier with fewer but higher quality recipes, but then you probably would not have a 1001 of them, either).   In the muffin section: 1) it is humorous to see basically the same recipe 500 times 2) the batter measurement and/or yield information is often wrong 3) each recipe has a picture, but many pictures are either wrong or next to the wrong recipe 4) textures ranged from pasty to dry to undercooked 5) few recipes worked correctly 6) sub-division of this long section would have been helpful: sweet vs. savory, flour vs. whole grain vs. biscuit mix, mix and dump vs. whipped egg whites, etc. 7) author uses 4 different muffin pan sizes, seemingly at random (the sizes are: 2.0, 2.25, 2.75, and 3.0 inches diameter).  8) many recipes are wrong: missing ingredients, missing recipe steps, incorrect ingredients.   9) the yields go all over the place, ranging from 3 muffins to 4 dozen; would it have been that much trouble to standardize all the recipes to yield 6 or 12 muffins using one size muffin tin? 10) the recipe names are not consistent: some muffins that use cocoa powder are called "chocolate muffins", while others are called "cocoa muffins".  11) the amount of baking powder seems to be excessive in many recipes.   12) some of the ingredients make no sense: "lecithin granules" (fyi: 1 teaspoon of lecithing is enough for 20 -40 pounds of product)? 2 T of "dried grated orange zest" for only a dozen muffins (perhaps the author is thinking of candied orange peels)? 13) muffins with egg and fat only, no liquid 14) a majority of the recipes have one or more whole grain ingredients, so if you want a muffin with just plain, old flour, your choices are limited (many of the recipes seem to be cribbed from cookbooks from the "health concious" 70's and early 80's).    I have similar complaints about the inconsistency and sloppiness of the other chapters in the book (here, I am referring to the editing and recipe quality, not the mess it makes in your kitchen). Consider, for example, mixing methods. The one used for muffins is perfect, the one for biscuits is wrong, and the one for coffee cakes is hopelessly confused.  Page 295 has the ingredient "Whipped Cream Topping (see recipe page XXX)"; good luck trying to find it, because it is not listed in the index and I am not flipping through 480 pages of recipes to find it.  Contrary to what the author states on page 307, the origin of what we know today as "quick bread" is English high tea, not holiday celebrations.  Many of the quick bread recipes did not have enough liquid; they make adequate substitutes for gypsum board, but were not suitable for human consumption (I would love to make a joke about even the dog not wanting to eat them, but I do not have a dog).  It is also the only cookbook I know of that calls for distilled spirits in generous quantities as a baking ingredient, from 1/2 to 1 cup of rum, brandy, kirsch, creme de cacao, etc.  The quick breads come out of the oven looking and tasting like masonery bricks. Most of the scones I tried looked and tasted like hockey pucks.    It has chapters on muffins (236 pages), biscuits (18 pages), cobblers (6 pages), doughnuts (10pages), quick breads (118 pages), pancakes (10 pages), popovers (6 pages), scones (28 pages), and waffles (12 pages).  In general: 1) in each chapter, the recipes are arranged alphabetically by title 2) index is correlated by ingredient only 3) a master list of all recipes would have been helpful 4) index needs to be cross-referenced by recipe title, not just ingredients 5) does not specify how flour is measured (scoop and sweep, spoon and sweep, etc.)    
 I tried to like this CD but Mr Tyrell just doesn't make it work.  He lacks the style/charisma of an icon like Frank Sinatra. The songs come across as lackluster 
 After the hype on this book, I was extremely disappointed at how it rambled along with extraneous detail that never made a cohesive whole. I kept at it, hoping it would improve but alas, dear reader it does not. 
 Mr. West writes about the Vatican not about the Roman Catholic Church. If he had not been a priest i would  have understand some of his descriptions  about Catholic Church. Since he has enouph information on the subject it  seems he wants to "reprove" some of the Church's institutions by  providing information he knows not beeing totaly correct. Saying half a  true it is the better way to say a lie Maria Santo 
 The picture is good and the combo was convenient.  However, after 1 year, the DVD broke.  Now I have just a TV.  This is the problem with combos.  It is better to get components separately 
 Filled with bizarre generalizations, and the most pretentious phraseology I've seen in years, this book has the dubious honor of spotlighting all that has gone wrong in academic research in this country in the last 20  years.  Jodi Dean shows an appalling lack of understanding of the workings  of culture, history, politics, or even writing style.  It seems she should  have spent more time with Turabian's Manual for Writers, than surfing the  web or watching Sienfeld 
 ....I have ever read. Not the worst either. But I didn't enjoy it. I see that alot of the other reviewers thought it was great, but, I guess it was just not to my taste. Bummer is I bought it new. (lol)I am not going to go on with the series...why throw good money after bad 
 This movie is not worth Sam Elliot.  I was very dissapointed, I will most likely thow it away 
 Some thoughts on "A Carnivore's Inquiry:"  A narrator can be both sympathetic and unsympathetic provided that they are interesting to read about. Katherine's closest relative, Hannibal Lecter, knew more about wine, food and culture than we did, and we envied him for it.  Katherine Shea knows very little about anything other than what brands surround her, and her ambivalence towards horrific events is merely adolescent rather than indicative of humanity.  Murray's exquisite skill at painting a scene is akin to eating nothing but Creme Brulee. Inside the twelve course meal that is the novel, one craves a greater variety of ingredients. I am sure her short stories are marvels.  Her characters are not convincing actors; their motivations for action are suspect when they are present, which is not often. We are asked to believe that our distant, dilettante narrator inspires lust and love in every man she meets.  This is implied and not convincingly rendered.  The historical recreations fail to reflect, augment or amplify the novel's main theme: man's hunger for literal or spiritual wealth (laid down in a paragraph on page 286).  Thought was given to their rendering, but not to their overall thematic importance.  We cannot believe in her resourcefulness as a character because chance plays too large a role in her life.  For a gourmand, she is surprisingly chaste about describing sex or her carnivorous meals.  Murray's talents would have been put to great use here. 
 What a waste of time. This was like sitting through a very boring business course. I was never interested in turning the page. I would have liked to see more of Carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this story.Instead I felt like a robot was telling this story.Very much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else. I forced myself to finish this. A huge diaappointment.Don't waste your money 
 There is no need to pick up this book and read the reviews on the back because they are misleading, and there's no reason to read the book unless required for a class.  You can capture the essence of the story from the beginning and believe, me the story doesn't change throughout.  I forged on to finish the book thinking there would be some wonderful climax to the story or turn of events but found the same old boring characters and story with lack of depth, and if I'd stopped at the beginning of the book I wouldn't have missed anything.  Leopards don't change their spots and neither did Dangerfield.  As far as the writing goes, a grade school child could've written half of it.  Not a literary wizard in my mind.  I was recommended this book when at Greane's bookstore in Dublin and was told it was very funny.  Not so.  Not funny.  Don't read it and be led on that it must get better as you go because it does not 
 This book is absolutely painful to read.  If you have to purchase this book for class, be prepared for chapter 7, 10, & 11.  These are the most painful chapters in the book.  In these chapters it is very hard to follow the text (i.e. main points).  Other students and I got migranes from trying to prepare notes for these chapters for a test.  Just horrible 
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 A much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story.  The end was a disappointment and the middle laborious 
 I've read this book with my third graders for the past several years.  They love it.  They enjoy having a candy corn contest of their own while reading the book 
 The book tells us little about Shakespeare himself. Rather, it is a chronicle of Elizabethan times in England. We learn more about his contemporaries, e.g. Johnson, than we do about Shakespeare. There is even more information in the book that touches on the physical layout of the Globe Theater than the playwrite. The book is, however, a fairly concise, yet informative listing of his plays 
 Virtually all the ideas in this book are already practiced by most successful company's - they just describe them differently. There is nothing new. My other problem is how the author uses the book to promote a personal agenda. And talk about ego - his family, friends, and other business initiatives are promoted in the book. And most of the pictures have nothing to do with the title of the book or how it is positioned. If it's going to be an autobiography, TELL US SO. I should have known something was up when most of the reviewers were either politicians, friends or other people that have never ran successful businesses.   And speaking of business success, a share of stock in Jan 1994 (around the time Mr. Bakke became CEO) was trading at an adjusted $5 per share. Seven years later in December of 2002 (the year Mr. Bakke retired), the share price was $3.02. No thanks - I'll put my money in GE. Need I say more.   Look, I'm sure this guy is a great person and he is obviously super smart but I do not think this is a credible book. 
 I used this text a few years ago when I was writing a paper on ethics of pesticide use, and it certainly details information well. However, the general tone is often anal and the writing style is extremely drab. Most of  the diagrams included were generated using low-budget graphics software,  and  it shows.  At 811 pages, this is an overly long book and not all the  chapters (24 total) can be covered in a single Echem course. Also, there is  no solutions manual and the problems Manahan gives are challening (a  section of numerical solutions placed in the back of the text would have  been nice...)  This is a good reference text, but  if you're looking for a  semester-long or short-term text to use for an Echem course, use Baird's  text, not Manahan's 
 The iRock's sound quality is on par for most of these FM transmitters, they all sound bad. I was aware of the sound limitations when I bought the iRock, my big issue is the design and placement of the power button. It is set up in such a way if you put it in your glove box (or just about anywhere) you can guarantee something will press the power button and run down the batteries. Very frustrating. The iRock also limits you to only four station radio choices, 88.1, 88.3 etc. Since I live in Boston, a fairly large city with many, many colleges, those frequency are being used. So the iRock is useless for me when I am downtown. As soon as I get out of the city I'm fine. There has to be a better unit out there 
 Lauren Slater was prescribed Prozac in 1988 when the pharmaceutical first came out.  She recalls having an almost immediate and "blissed out" feeling.  Slater says that Prozac made her "high" and goes on and on about it obsessively as she describes her reaction to Prozac as, "the single most stunning experience of my life."  This is rather melodramatic.  I have tried Prozac and I have been depressed throughout my life.  Taking a pharmacetical like Prozac does not make a person "high."  I have a real problem with the way Slater portrays Prozac as her "drug."  She pontificates as if taking an anti-deppressant for DEPPRESSION is shameful, secretive.  Slater becomes an intern at a half-way house for "boozers" and is informed that staff member's sign waivers allowing the administration to do random urine screens.  Athough Slater does not use any illegal drugs, she panics at the thought of "being revealed."  Slater compares herself to the addicts who live at the half-way house.  Describing a client, she says "he stared straight at me, one junkie to another..."     It insulting to those of us who have struggled with addiction to have Slater describe herself as a "junkie" because she is over dramatizing her experience with Prozac.  It was persribed to her for the treatment of a disease and she was NOT abusing the medication.   (I am in recovery and have been clean for 3 years).  Slater later also considers herself "drug-dependent" and tries to convince the reader of her claim with her interpretation of what The DSM IV calls addiction.  I don't buy it, and I don't think anyone who has struggled with drug or alcohol addiction will either.  Maybe a reader without a history of addiction and/or depression won't notice that Slater is a phoney and an alarmist.  Nobody is buying the "addicted to Prozac" crap.         
 The authors speak of real problems, but address them ineffectively.  By peddling generalizations of the white race, they perpetuate the victim/victimizer dichotomy which divides instead of uniting.  Further, the boundary between victim and victimizer is drawn rigidly along racial lines.  They fail to recognize that any progress has been made in the decades since the civil war toward a more loving, color blind society.  This truly dishonors the memory of those whose blood and tears watered the garden from which African Americans now harvest financial and educational opportunities as well as self worth.  A better discussion, in my opinion, can be found in Joel Kovel's book by the same title 
 My 9 month old has lots of favorite board books (Mirror Me, Pat the Bunny, Goodnight Moon, etc) and this has never been one of them.  I think this book is a little too much for babies, although it sounds like toddlers really enjoy it.  I guess we'll pull it out again in another six months or so 
 This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. "Saturday Night Fever" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.  I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.  Physically, Beales is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.  But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.  The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out "the Limey" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.  Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right ("Saturday Night Fever" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director. It's a shame 
 This is a wonderful movie - with much more artistic content than the earlier shorter Christmas story video.  It is great except that for half the movie people are calling Charlie Brown names.  Blockhead, worthless, etc etc.  We had to stop the movie while our four year old was half through.  I should have prescreened it.  I don't trust peanuts videos now - for my impressionable four year old.  Maybe when she is older.. 
 It was great to see something totally different come out of Asia. While their ghost stories aren't the only ones being produced they are the most popular over there and in the States.  It's sort of like American slasher movies if you look around the 80s were dominated by them, but that isn't all that was made in American horror.  After my last viewing of a ghost movie, which was the South Korean movie The Red Shoes I decided to take a break. While not bad it just suffered from the same basic formula of past movies.  In Bloody Reunion there is no Asian ghost girl to be found, which was a nice change. I have wanted to see this movie for quite some time, but what I got wasn't what I really wanted.  I'll skip the plot rehash since there is already a description here on Amazon. A lot of people have compared this to Friday the 13th due to the whole deformed kid.  Besides that Bloody Reunion has very little in common with the Friday the 13th flicks.  The first half of Bloody Reunion is quite slow as we meet the characters, but around the midway mark things start to come out as we learn of past grudges.  While, Bloody Reunion has an interesting set up my problem was there was no sense of dread and doom lingering. I never got that feeling something bad was gonna happen.   John Carpenter's Halloween had it with Michael Myers always lurking in the back round. Dario Argento did it with Deep Red despite the killer only appearing when they killed. Director Lim Dae-Woong doesn't do a bad job, but he just doesn't create any mood in the first half. He did try, but it just wasn't working.  The 2nd half is when things pick up and the killer starts knocking off all the characters one by one. But the problem was the killer shows up and attacks.  It's not always about the kill scenes its more about how it's built up a lot of the times. The best parts of movies like Halloween, Deep Red and the original Black Christmas were the set ups not the actual kill scenes. Bloody Reunion had some graphic murders, which is fine, but again there wasn't much of a set up.  The characters were ok and maybe if I cared more about them the approach would have worked better.  None of the characters really stood out and honestly they were all alike. I'll give credit to the makers for going for character development. We do learn a little about them, maybe more so then your average run of the mill slasher flick, but when all is said and done none stand out enough.  Asian horror isn't really known for their gore these days, but I have noticed they are getting a little bit more violent. Bloody Reunion has some violent murder scenes and while they are cool looking I just wasn't all that interested.  The one thing that bothers me about horror movies these days is the twist endings. It seems like every horror flick has to take some kind of twist at the end.  Some work and some don't and some just seem they are done for the sake of it. At first the twist in Bloody Reunion might be a little confusing, but it's all pretty much explained. But my problem with the twist without giving anything away it sort of renders everything that came before it rather pointless.  I've seen other movies with a twist like this, but I don't know they seemed to work where as here it just didn't.  I really wanted to like the movie and while I didn't hate it I just walked away thinking how it really could have been so much more than it was.  It's a nice change of pace though for Asian horror. The ghost story really seems to have run its course.  I like slasher movies, but not as much as I did when I was a child. For those into slashers and Asian horror you might like Bloody Reunion. Again I didn't hate it, but I do feel it could have been better.  In my opinion it's more of a 2 and a half star movie, but since that isn't an option I decided to go with the 2-star rating.  Bloody Reunion doesn't come highly recommended, but it's not bad for a boring night with nothing to do. 
 President Clinton's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries.  It frequently appears as though the brief, daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added.  It does provide an extensive recap of President Clinton's life events, so if that's of interest you may want to check it out 
 Mosher's central thesis, well documented with error, misunderstanding and paranoid bias, suggests China has been hell-bent on world domination since Mosher's ancestors were living in caves (possibly they still are). Fast-forward to the present, he finds a yellow menace in every teapot of the "Middle Kingdom" (which properly translated means, literally, "middle" or "center" "land", not "kingdom", a common misconception of non-Chinese speakers).  If you have a taste for right-wing paranoia, this makes an amusing read.  BTW, another reviewer, Chuck Devore, who writes a glowing review, happens to be the co-author of another of Mosher's paranoid fantasies "China Attacks" (Taiwan).  No further comment. 
 I recently ordered a Kodak camera from Amazon.com. With that I also ordered this battery & the camera bag. Everything was delivered as expected, EXCEPT the camera. Over 2 weeks later I was notified the camera is not available. Now I'm stuck with a battery & camera bag that I can't return because they came from another seller. The camera I bought from a different seller came with the bag & uses a different battery. Now I'm out the cost of the battery, the bag & the shipping charges! Thanks a lot 
 We wish we had not wasted our money on this juvenile, violent, lousily acted series. How this survived as many seasons as it did is beyond our comprehension! Our eyes glazed over right from the first segment. We couldn't believe how bad it was. The second segment never made it into the DVD player. What a waste of time 
 My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years; however, the items received were nothing like the picture.  The pictured item was exactly what she wanted, lace waistband AT (not below) her waist and high-cut leg openings; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different (and unsatisfactory) fit.  She'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return 
 I love Victor Hugo's writting ability. No one can write confrontational scenes better than him. I believe his book Les Miserables is the best fictional book that has ever been written, bar none. I also love the Hunchback of Notre Dame, to me it's one of the top five to ten books that I have ever read.   Anyone who has read any of his books knows that the climaxes of his books are extraordinary.... no one comes close. No one can write confrontational scenes better than him. They also know that his writting is more beautiful than just about any other author who has ever lived.   People who have read Victor Hugo's books also know that he likes to go off on tangents that get away from the story for numerous pages. For instance, in Les Miserables he goes on for countless pages describing the convent and the sewer system. These tangents that he loves to go on are extremly unnecesary and take away from the story in his books but you deal with them because the story is worth it.  The Toilers of the Sea is also a great story but the book is so marred with these tangets and over explanation of EVERYTHING that it just totally bogs the book down. It's a good story but not good enough to fight through everything.   The first half of the book is very difficult to get through, the first fifty or so pages is just an explanation of the surrounding islands... the next 150 pages or so are overkill explanations of the plot and seeting it up. I honestly don't believe half of the people who start this book will make it to page 200 unless they are forced to for a school project etc.   The next 230 pages are a lot more interesting but Victor Hugo's over explaining every detail and his constantly annoying habbit of saying the same thing ten different ways really makes this book difficult and rather boring.  Gillete, the main character is really a awesome character (he reminds me of Jean ValJean in Les Miserables)and there really is a good story here about him, Deruchette, Senior Clubin and Miss Leherity (I'm probably buthering the spellings.... sorry) but I honestly think very few people will make it through the book. If Victor would have had an editor who could have helped clean this up and shorten it I think it would have been a lot better.  P.S. I also hated the ending.... what Gillete did to himself at the end of the book just totally annoyed me 
 The Psycho Realm sounds like a cross between Cypress Hill and the Gravediggaz.  At first many of the eerie beats are catchy, but too many of the songs sound similar and soon the novelty gets old.  Not a bad debut, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone unless they are a huge fan of B Real and the Hill 
 This is a good book for people who want to learn more about the great  Italian luthier, but it definitely has its flaws. The book was written  around the turn of the 20th century and its style is very stilted and  convuluted. I often had the feeling the authors could have conveyed the  information they give us in two pages in one paragraph. Also, their worship  of anything related to Stradivari gets to be a bit much after awhile.  Still, this is the book to turn to for information on this great violin  maker 
 "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" is a history of that villain we all love to hate from the L. Frank Baum children's classic, The Wizard of Oz. I hate to write a completely negative review, so I'll start with something good. I finished it. Even that is not saying so much, since I rarely abandon a book in mid-read.  My most lasting impression of Wicked is that it just doesn't fit with the characters as I know them. In this book the Wizard is a corrupt tyrant; the Wicked Witch of the East is an (admittedly disliked) political leader and religious influence in Munchkinland; Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, cares more about fashion and society than true good works; and the central character, the Wicked Witch of the West, is not really wicked, nor is she technically even a witch, though she is still decidedly green. The lengthy philosophical discussions of politics, religion, animal rights, the nature of evil, and the presence or absence of souls felt empty and out of place with the colorful and imaginative Oz I love. Here, Oz seems dreary and unrecognizable. I don't dislike philosophy, but I missed the fantasy. In author Gregory Maguire's telling, life in Oz is bleak.  I had hoped this book would give me a new appreciation for why the witch (named Elphaba--a take on L. Frank Baum's initials) is the way she is. What I got instead was a mostly uninteresting character whose story went nowhere. I admire the attempt to humanize a villainess, but presenting her as a (somewhat) complex and (somewhat) sympathetic character makes her actions against Dorothy, not all of which are documented here, so much the less believable. Sometimes the villain just needs to be a villain! Confusingly, Maguire has taken too many liberties with the original The Wizard of Oz, ignoring some key scenes and reinventing others to suit his purposes.  It's nearly impossible to separate this book from its roots in the work upon which it purports to be based, but even as a stand-alone novel, it fails. Maguire hints at ideas and plot points that either never come together or are completely abandoned. The bottom line is that I love books I can't put down. This one put me to sleep. Literally. I finished it, but only because I really wanted to like it and hoped for some redeeming conclusion. It simply did not live up to the potential of its intriguing premise 
 i wear earplugs at night and i could still hear this humidifier....  how is that silent 
 I have been using Norton Anti-Virus since I purchased the Compaq Presario 4000. The reason I have stuck with Norton because this Presario came with Norton Internet Security 2002 attached to it. I never used the NIS 2002, though, but I purchased the Norton Anti-Virus (NAV) 2003 which I have bee using for the last three years. In fact I used the NAV 2004 for two straight years without any response from Symantec, then all of a sudden that subscription was eventually retired by Symantec. I liked the NAV 2005 (which Symantec six months prior to its due date subscription, which made me mad and hence my wanting to try NIS at a subsidized rate) because like NAV 2003, it could tell if someone or something was trying to intrude into your computer. It is after purchasing and trying NIS 2005, that I realized how low and base Norton can go with its software. First when I tried NIS 2005, it blocked all my websites. I couldnt access them and I could not read my e-mail (Whenever I tried to read my e-mail, the response would be that, that action has been cancelled). So I reformatted my hard drive and the NIS 2005 appeared to be working quite well until I tred to install Adobe Reader 7.08 and couldn't allow me to proceed. Moreover, it was snail slow in allowing me to read one mail to another. So I uninstalled NIS 2005 and installed NAV 2006, which appears to be working well. I have now purchased Tend Micro PC-cillin 2006 as well as McAfee Viruscan 2006 at subsidized rates, should Symantec pematurely terminate my NAV 2006 prematurely i.e. before the 366 days of subscription are over. I think one of the reasons why NIS could not work is that it is a program that it is trying to do more than it can chew. It tried to be an anti-virus, personal firewall, privacy control, antispam as well as parental control in one. It reminds of the days when it was better to purchase a cassette player separate from  the radio, since the technology at that time could not produce a good combined raio cassette player. I think Norton Internet Security is in that mode. It is not yet competent to produce a combined solution that is both antivirus and anti spam,anti-spyware at the same time. Hence the many complaints of its being a buggy program. At this stage, I would stay away from any program that calls itself "Internet Security." I may try Trend Micro internet Security which has received rave reviews from a couple of its users, but that will be if something goes wrong with my current NAV 2006. Otherwise, I am still wary of those programs that pass off as "Internet Security" such as "Norton Internet Security" or "Trend Micro Internet Security," pending their perfection of this technology at some future date 
 It's always difficult for a beginner to review a textbook, because there's always the chance that your reactions are entirely offbase. It is possible that some people, trying to learn to hold their breath longer while underwater will value 360 pages of advice as "Getting Dressed. Start by putting on the trousers: insert the legs, first one then the other," and "We complete the scaling of the existential levels by passing to the colour violet, where we stabilise a contact with our most intimate reality, that which we call the spiritual dimension," while foregoing any significant discussion of strategies for dealing with the sensations of holding your breath.   To me, this book is infuriatingly short of relevant information. Not only do you get advice on how to put on pants, there are sections that seem relevant (the 2.5 pages on the circulatory system, say), that jump between streams of grade-school exposition ("The heart is a hollow muscle that has the capacity to function like a pump; expanding and contracting, it sucks blood that is delivered continuously by the veins and pushes it to the peripheries of the body through the arteries....") and trivia ("...[blood] is propagated by their elastic walls at a velocity of 9 meters per second. However in the arterioles of the periphery the velocity drops to one millimetre per second....") without actually introducing any relevant facts (does blood velocity have something to do with freediving? Maybe. I wouldn't know it after reading this book. And the book is packed with clearly irrelevant information, such as 2 pages on the Beaufort wind scale).  To reconcile my reaction with the 5 star reviews from those who can do statics of 5+ minutes and so forth, I can only say that perhaps they skipped the trivia, don't need practical advice on breath holding, and valued specific advice on, say, finning technique.   The 30 pages of chapter 11 "Training for Apnea" will _possibly_ take less time to read than finding equivalent advice on the Web, but are hardly worth $40. For me, this book was an utter waste of money. 
 you cannot indirectly blame other cultures for the evils of the world, ignorance is a far greater foe. I pity the Author for an otherwise well informed book, she has let herself down in her lack of education of other cultures and ignorance. when writing a book research is important, and so is education, that is the ability to understand what you have researched. In a world often rife in racism and persecution, another coal in the fire. Clearly the Author does not have sufficient knowledge of Wicca or eastern religions, which in 2007 is abismal. may your soul have peace Dion 
 While Black and Blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse, it is rather difficult to identify with, like, or even feel anything for the protagonist.    Black and Blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband.  First of all, the book seems to me like a Lifetime Movie, almost cheesy if you will.  Half of the things the main character does, you are screaming at her in your head to not do them.  She is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie, who runs up the stairs instead of out the door.    I found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist.  While I was rooting for her, it was because she was the victim, not because I actually liked or understood her.  She seemed weak, in that she really didn't do much of anything to help herself or her situation, either everyone else did everything for her, or things just kind of happened. Yes, it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband, however, that was the only thing she ever really did for herself (pick up the phone).  Everything else was done for her, mostly without her knowledge.  She was doing something that was so hard to do, she should have felt like a strong woman to me, but she didn't not in the least and I attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non-actions of the main character.   One thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks.  While they were integral to the story, they came at the oddest moments.  Sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else, if it was actually happening in real time, or it was all in her head.  In the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a 2 or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation.  This left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real-time conversation was even about.    Overall, the basics of the plot were interesting, as were some of the characters in the book.  The book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse; however, it was not captivating.  I will not buy, recommend or read this book again. 
 Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? & second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? & then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. & then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. & for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film 
 I bought this for my son, who will be leaving the military within the next year.  I was disappointed at the number of schools covered, especially in Ohio. It did not cover public Universities such as Kent State or University of Akron. I am still not sure what group of students this book has some use for... 
 To say this film is self-indulgent is a masterpiece of understatement. Almost every joke in this movie that didn't center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to one of Smiths other movies. Maybe if you are a great filmmaker you can get away with that, but if you have only made 4 other films (very poor ones too by cinematic standards) then that just means you have the worlds biggest ego.  The film looks as if it was written by a highschool kid, although the humor really dosen't reach even that level. Here is a recap of the types of humor in this film. Making fun of fans, fart jokes, scatological jokes, profanity (yes this is actually supposed to be funny in and of itself), making fun of miramax, making fun of the viewers for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film (I swear I am not making this up), and any number of inside jokes involving the cast and crew.  This movie comes across as crass, tasteless, profane and generally an abject debacle in all respects.   Thank God I borrowed this movie and didn't pay anything to rent it. I won't be watching another Kevin Smith movie anytime soon 
 If you're looking for Billie in her prime, look elsewhere.  All the music on this CD was recorded between '45 and '47 after she had lost her voice.  Look for the classic recording of Strange Fruit from '39 on one of the other CDs available.    
 Brick's biggest hit, "Dazz" is spectacular in its long version, with its whistling/flute combo which I've never heard before or since in any musical genre.  You'd think it would naturally be included on the greatest hits album, since they are essentially a one hit wonder.  No such luck, as this compilation contains the short radio version of the song.  "Dusic" is the only other song which is halfway decent, but hardly warrants shelling out $10.  What a disappointment.. 
 I had seen other reviews for this book, raving about it.  To me, it indicates that there is a dearth in the art curriculum arena.  I need to quit my day job and start writing.  The book is colorful and has some merit, but is really nothing more than someone's collection of pictures for children to copy.  Somewhere, somehow, I would love to find an art curriculum for children that is deeper than a creek bed but also practical.  
 This clock includes a chip that was designed to change the time.  When the new daylight savings time was effective the clock would not reset to the new time.  Interestingly the manufacturer has not removed the clocks from inventory or attempted to inform buyers of the issue as of yet. Other than that it is a beautifull clock 
 This is a weak book that rehashes other books on the subject. Save your mone 
 I have some Surrender Cinema stuff and they are really good softcore. But, this DVD is not. It's completely censored, if you buy it, you're gonna miss all the good parts. It lasts only 70+min when it's supposed to last 90. Don't buy this unless you get a really uncut version 
 Let me say right out that Sasha and Digweed are fantastic DJs, each in their own right, and that the Delta Heavy tour was an epic experience.  Unfortunately, this DVD does not pack the expected punch of the actual performance.  Make no mistake, this is NOT a concert footage DVD.  Instead you will find interviews galore detailing the logistics and documenting the events surrounding the Delta Heavy tour.  The music, for the most part, is not even live.  Too much talk, waste of money.  Pick up Sasha's Involver or Digweed's Fabric instead, forget the DVD.    
 After trying (and failing) to stay awake whilst reading the novel, I can recommend it as a sure-fire cure for insomnia! Aside from that the book is boring, badly written and a real disapointment 
 Heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture, there's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal Swarovski crystal, in other words, no colors shine at all. Same thing in on other sites for like $1.  Speedy delivery was the only positive 
 The Tomtom has great features.  But I returned mine.  First, the maps are very dated.  This makes it iffy at best.  It has terrific potential, if it worked.  You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip.  It's amazing.  But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints.  But I tried a local test first.  I used roads as waypoints, main roads.  This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes.  I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database.  I set up a local route, and started to follow it.  It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem.  But it would not go past the first waypoint.  I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!.  I did.  Then it said take another u turn.  It had me going in circles.  Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would.  The manual was no help.  Support was no help.  So it went back.  I have ordered a Garmin i2.  Hope this is ok.  I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330.  The Garmin has maps that you cannot update, but got me to my destination no problem.  I don't recommend this TomTom.  Do research.  Go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals.  Hope this helps 
 When the title of your book is "Confirmation: The Hard Evidence of Aliens Among Us" it would probably be a good idea to produce some hard evidence. This book is the loosest of innuendo; the shakiest of suppositions; and probably hurts more than helps the UFO movement. The so-called "hard evidence" - the shards of foreign materials found in a few people are classified as alien, even though not one of them is of a foreign substance not found in nature. I love a good UFO tale, but this book proves absolutely nothing and isn't even a provocative read. Whitley has completely milked the alien abduction genre, and I'm sure he's not done... It's been too profitable 
 Robert A. Heinleins novel "Starship Troopers" still creates controversy, generations after it was first published. Indeed, the well-known movie "Starship Troopers" was actually a veiled criticism of the book!   Is Heinlein's book racist or fascist? Is it a Cold War allegory? Is it anti-democratic and militarist? How does this novel square with Heinlein's reputation for being a libertarian and near-hippie? These questions are still being hotly debated.   "Starship Troopers" describe a future society in which only people who have served in the military enjoy full citizenship rights. Only honorably discharged soldiers have the right to vote and run for office. Strangely enough, the non-citizens enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of worship and the right to start businesses. Heinlein's future society thus looks like modern America, but with a Marine Corps-like military caste superimposed on top. In the novel, humanity wages a never-ending war against several races of intelligent space aliens, including the collectivist Arachnids, who resemble spiders. Many people take the Arachnids to be a symbol for Communism in general or Red China in particular. Imperial Japan is another possibility.   Heinlein's novel attempts to solve that ancient question: how can a society make sure that the best people serve in office? This question is particularly acute in democracies, where anyone can stand for office, and everyone can vote. Heinlein's solution is to limit the franchise to those who have served in the military. In this way, only the best are selected for the job. And those willing to put their lives on the line must be the best. But does that really solve the problem?   A military is not necessarily a good administrator or politician. The best in times of peace might be different from the best in times of war. Heinlein's system only works if a total and never-ending war is raging. Indeed, the war against the Arachnids certainly seem to be such. But if so, it's naive to expect freedom of speech or extensive rights for non-citizens. The system would become a military dictatorship pure and simple, like in the movie "Starship Troopers".   The soldiers in the novel are probably inspired by the philosopher-kings and Guardians of Plato's "Republic". After rigorous military training, the officers are given courses in moral philosophy, history and politics. But there are also similiarities with ancient Athenian democracy. Every citizen of ancient Athens was expected to serve in the army or navy. There was a connection between rights and duties. But note that many non-citizens in Athens were slaves!   Ultimately, "Starship Troopers" is unconvincing, even naive. You simply cannot give political power to the military, no matter how the military is recruited, and expect everything else to stay the same.  
 On page after page of this book, Western Imperialism shines through. It's over, Mr. Bell. The Empire is no more! I could not bring myself to finish this book. I was that offended by the apparent xenophobia and the preposterous plot 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 "Page's book is a quick glance over Tarantino's films from literary studies perspective. A good companion if you want to check out approaches on how to look at the films. Everyone who hasn't read the indispensible trio Bernard-Holm-Smith yet, or everyone who just wants to read a simple, fast and uncomplicated analysis of his films, should ca nit, but the book just is not really more than that." -Sebastian H. (Full review available at www.tarantino.info 
 THERE WAS NO DOUBT I WASN'T WARNED BEFORE PURCHASING THIS, WHAT I WAS GETTING.  IT'S SARCASTIC, PARTS ARE FUNNY, BUT I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO WASTE ANY MORE OF MY TIME BY FINISHING THE BOOK. HOWEVER, HIS BOOK ABOUT THE WOLF & 3 PIGS WAS MUCH MORE CLEVER AND ENTERTAINING 
 The intro to TAPI starts out well, but many in depth TAPI features are not well covered.  Most noticeably missing is more than a perfunctory coverage of transmissing/receiving data through TAPI. The book's main thrust is  voice emulation.   This book was recommended to me, but I would have  difficulty recommending to anyone else 
 Chingy, one of the few people in the world that can't change his facial expression. His music is ridiculously bad, his beats are annoying, and his face alone is enough to make me want to kick his teeth in.  Do yourself a favor, and flush this turd down, along with all your fiddy cent and D4L CDs

 A friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday after someone else recommended it to her. We decided to read it with a group of friends, so then we could all see what it was about. Having just finished the book, I can say that I really did not enjoy reading it and had to force myself to finish it. The mix of Spanish and English may appeal to some, but to a non-Spanish speaker, it was more of a hindrance. The plot goes way off the deep end, and before there is any real character or plot development, the reader is suddenly overwhelmed with a major event, just a few pages into the book. Various details included in the story seemed rather useless and excessive, being tossed in and never brought up again, at least not in a major way. For example, the interruption of the plot to discuss the lesbian couple from Oakland was not much than that, just an interruption. The effect of these characters was so subtle that a few of my reading group friends didn't quite understand the reason for its inclusion in the book. In this example, the author seemed to lack the ability to tie it into the overall plot, merely hinting at the ramifications. However, actually bringing these minor details into the book may have been even worse, only because the book would have been longer then! If you're considering reading this "novel", I'd suggest you find a better, more well-written book to spend your time with instead 
 I was looking for a real thriller, and thought I would try one by David Baldacci. I had read a very favourable review a while back, and I have also seen and enjoyed the movie version of Absolute Power.  After reading reviews at Amazon, I picked Last Man Standing. However, I was really disappointed. For me it wasn't thrilling at all. Several times I had to force myself to pick it up again to continue reading. For me, a good thriller is a book you can't stop reading, even if it's getting late and you really, really should try to get some sleep instead of continue reading.  Examples of great thrillers I have read are: The Firm by John Grisham, The Day After Tomorrow by Allan Folsom (nothing to do with the weather-related movie of the same name) and Angels and Demons by Dan Brown.  But Last Man Standing was quite the opposite. Sure it had its moments where it got exciting for a while (the final shoot-out for example), but those times were quite rare.  I've been trying to figure out why I didn't like it, but I can't say I know why. I do think that a lot of what happens in the book is quite far-fetched (especially the reason the hero Web London froze during the ambush) and that the characters are pretty one-dimensional, but that's not enough of a reason. Both The Day After Tomorrow and Angels and Demons have plenty of far-fetch twists and one-dimensional characters, but they were still exciting reads. I can't come up with a definite answer as to why I didn't like Last Man Standing - I simply just didn't care for it.  Writing a negative review like this will probably earn me a few unhelpful votes, but I think it is important to also review books you didn't like. Otherwise you risk getting an unbalanced view. However, I do admit that it is much more fun to review books you really liked.  But to finish, if you are looking for a good thriller, skip this one and try one of the other three I mentioned above. 
 I bought this book to learn some interisting new facts that I have not heard about before. Well this book didn't do that. Most of the stuff in this book I have read in other places and it was written better. Like The "Red Queen" by Matt Ridley & "Why is Sex Fun" by Jarod Diamond.  This book relies to heavely on statistical data to come up with anything very interisting. I found myself skipping complete pages and chapters because of the boredom for having to read to many statistics. If you are looking to use this book as a resource to quote statistics about sex then you are in good shape, this book will give you plenty of that. Other wise i recomend that you stir clear of this book. 
 I was one of Entertainment Weekly's charter subscribers way back in 1990. It started out great -- a different, intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage. But financially, things were shaky, so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience. I couldn't blame the editors. It helped them reach the needed tipping point, and they gained their needed mass audience. EW remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus, and I kept resubscribing.  Until 2006. These last few months, EW has fallen off a cliff. It has become entirely superficial and shallow, with hardly any substance at all. The publication design has also been degraded into a teen magazine format. I can only imagine the editors have decided that anyone over 30 is no longer part of their target audience. So, I've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly, mourning the enjoyable magazine that used to be 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it 
 I've tried for the fourth time to read this book. For the fourth time, I had to give up half-way. This book is just too dense for my simple mind.  I am sure that it contains more substance than most books on writing (hence, the generous two stars), but the packaging and, maybe, relevance compelled me, once more, to use the time I would on it to some other book more suitable for my Philistine tastes 
 I know it is spiral bound, but the cost should reflect that.  The information in it can easily be found elsewhere and in a format that is much easier to read and perhaps at a better price. Having read her blog many times, I expected something a little less dry, but I think she puts the best(and sometimes the worst) of herself in the blog and not in her books 
 This grill pan heats relatively evenly, and is large enough to accomodate four slices of bread, allowing for the preparation of two sandwiches simultaneously.  It leaves nice "grill marks" on the food, and works well overall. The press that comes with it is very nice to have, as it helps cook food faster. However, it has one major drawback: it makes a very odd smell when it is used, regardless of the temperature at which it is being heated. I thought maybe this smell would dissappear after several uses, but even after many uses the smell is still as strong as the day I took it out of the box. It is enough of an odor to make me wonder about the safety of the product.  I have a number of higher end Calphalon non-stick pans and none of them make this smell, making me think this is a consequence of a cheaper pan. Bottom line: If I had to do it over again, I would spend a bit more money and get a higher end Calphalon grill pan and press instead 
 Rhea Perlman, a short white woman, is going to teach basketball to her towering Black high school students. And even though she knows nothing about hasketball she can still turn them into winners because she's White and sensitive and wants to be their "sistah." Gag me. This whole movie is completely insulting to people of all races. The director seems so sure he can sell a hip-hop basketball movie this bad to "those people" that he doesn't even bother to hide his apparent distaste for them. Avoid at all costs 
 The book is the total chaos, alas, very boring one. I had to return it. So much paper out there waisted. Save the tree 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 Inspite of all the hype and controversy centering mainly on Leon Bings race and sex, this book is an valuable resource for gang research if for no other reason than it was the vehicle which led to the Monster Kody autobiography.  There are many holes in the structure of the book in relation to use of slang but that is understandable considering the author was obviously out of her element with this project.  Once again I would suggest reading this title for the early account of Monster Kody who was just emerging from one of his many jail stints.  The interview with Kody is far and away the highlight of the book even if the cover photo is a pathetic attempt to portray the danger of a murderous gang member as sexy.  
 The slipcover barely covered my sofa, will not cover the lower front and it barely hangs over the backside.  It keeps sliding off, where I have to adjust it several times during the day, if I could I would get my money back 
 I purchased this product about 2 months ago, the resolution is not the best but it's acceptable. After a month,it turned off by itself and wouldn't turn on again!! I sent it to repair and had to pay $50.00 !!!somenthing to do with the power button. I have it on a UPS with battery, also freezes for no reason. I don't recomend it 
 George Page is a journalist, not a researcher. Unfortunately, that does not save him from taking the posture of one who knows better. He dismisses whole fields of discourse with offhand remarks, for example: "Eventually behaviorism melded with the equally notorious sociobiology as formulated by E. O. Wilson." (p. 29) For an accessible yet scholarly exploration of animal cognition, I recommend Marc Hauser's "Wild Minds." Hauser is a scientist, who specializes in primate cognition. His writing is more lucid, and less affected. He addresses the same questions as Page, with an appreciation for subtle variaritions in the possible interpretations of evidence, which is lacking in Page's presentation. One comparison between the books: Page's bibliography is 3 pages long; Hauser's spans 30 
 This item is not worth $150, it looks like a cheap plastic child's toy.  Very disappointed, sent it back 
 Having been famous all over eastern Europe for its beauty and splendor, the amber room's unsolved disappearance in 1945 caused a true flood of unbridled speculations. The mystery proved itself extremely fertile for all sorts of fantasy-stories, mystery-novels, faked history reviews and other nonsense.  What is known & proven: after having been conquered by Adolf Hitler's soldiers in 1941, the room was transported from its palace outside Leningrad (= nowadays' St.-Petersburg) to the German city of Konigsberg (= nowadays' Russian Kaliningrad). On its way some of its items were stolen by German soldiers. Having arrived at Konigsberg, the room was exhibited in the local castle. In the second half of worldwar 2, when the danger of Allied bombing steadily increased, the amber room was stored for safety in the castle's cellars.   From this point knowledge stops and speculation sets in. In August 1944 Konigsberg was bombed twice. Its castle, right in the city centre, was hit and burned out completely. In April 1945 Konigsberg was captured by the Soviet army in savage streetfighting. In other words, from the moment of its storage opportunities for destruction had been plenty. The more so, while amber burns very well from itself.  Destruction of works of art surely was quite common in those terrible days in eastern Europe. Many of them vanished without trace. The difference with the amber room is only made by the latter's huge reputation, promptly turning its unrecorded disappearance into a legend.  I think it makes more sense to turn to the reality of our days. Sponsored by 'Ruhrgas AG', a German firm dealing in Russian gas, the amber room has been rebuilt with great Russian craftsmanship. In May 2003 Russian president Putin and German chancellor Schroder officially re-opened it.   The truly magnificent replica has been enrichened by one of its authentic panels. Presenting us with an Italian landscape made from colored stone, this panel was one of the items stolen in 1941. After having decorated an ordinary German living room for many years, it was traced by the police and returned to the Russians.  Purchasing a book or DVD on the replica surely is worth your money. You'll find them on many a German site. It makes more sense than losing yourself in all sorts of idle speculation.    
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 I read this book once. It was allright but too dark and racy for me. I like reading about vampires but this one was hard to follow in some parts and some parts I liked some but I liked Merrick better. BOOK WAS OKA 
 After reading Dim Sum of All Things, I became a big fan of Keltner's work. My biggest question was whether or not she would be able to break from the theme and writing style that worked so well for her in Dim Sum. Unfortunately, the answer is no. Dim Sum had a much better plot line and the small intricate stories she paints to animate her Lindsey character worked so well together that the reader was compelled to believe they were in Lindsey's shoes. In Buddha Baby, the overall plot is at best, weak. Keltner attempts to tell small stories of Lindsey's life, but this time, it does not work. Dim Sum was a breath of fresh air with plenty of stories that Asian people can especially identify with. The moments where you wanted to laugh or cry out loud from experiencing moments exactly like Lindsey are no longer there in Buddha Baby.  As an asian myself, a lot of her stories hit home and I have yet to read any work of fiction or non-fiction that even tries to explain much of what we face, especially being of the 1.5 generation. I have to hand it to Keltner to even attempt such a feat. I will forever cherish her Lindsey character, but her storytelling of Lindsey's Asian and American character duality has run its course. We barely get to see any this in Buddha Baby.  I will still read Keltner's next installment should she choose to continue it though. That Lindsey character she created is just wonderful 
 I read the book and I am convinced this Author did not read The Quran Shareef. She has no right to show her anti-islamic views to the world. I challenge her to read The Quran first then write. Islam is the only first religion which gives inheretance rights to woman. On one hand she does not belief in Allah, then she thank the God at the end of the book for helping her.She should apologise to Muslim poeple for lying about ISLAM & THE QURAN SHAREEF 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 One needs to bring some critical thinking to work as to what one buys and reads.  I fully agree with reader Guido.  Images are blurred, of extremely poor quality and not truly informative.  There is only a small number of examples offered in the book (as if this were an attempt to bring about a touch of reality to a text that would otherwise be even dryer and engineering-oriented).  The limited range of materials and processes is not representative of the industrial design practice.  Besides, conceptual categories which were employed to organize the book seemed to me quite confusing and not logically classified.  The author does show knowledge of the subject.  However, his approach is not particularly didactical and complete--and therefore not as useful as it could be.  I don't feel this is the right text and the right form for industrial designers.  The book, in my opinion, does not live up to the promise of its title and price 
 I just wanted the song.....Stars are Blind........instead I got a mixture of horrible music, and a part where Paris sings part of the song, but the mix is so bad, I'm sorry I wasted my money. I bought the CD.  I suppose I should have bought the DVD then I would have heard the song I wanted to hear, but I'd still get the same mix music that is on the CD.  Save your money!!  I like Paris, and her song, but I don't advise anyone to buy the CD. 
 Immigration acts, facts and proposals for the present US are surely important. However, we need a better job done on it than this book does. To be fair, this style of "semi-reporting" is popular and does sell; but, it's not what will do the job. It is full of the author's "we shoulds" when what we could better use would be "given A, if you want B, and are willing to do C then do/support E". The book is full of anecdotes, that we are not sure are representative, and of "opinions", of many "non-government organizations" and "advocacy groups". Read it to learn what is typical of what is out there. Otherwise, use your time more productivley to think and research the problem yourself and you will come out better off 
 I loved the art and rhymes in the book. However, there was a lot of fill in the blank spots for your baby's first few years. I prefer to jot my own thoughts instead of someone elses. There is not much place for pictures or extra writing either. I wish it had at least one pocket for storage of keepsakes. I will look for something that meets my needs 
 Not much in the way of humor on this one ("Easter Eggs" and "Orange Drink"-which was stolen from Bobcat Goldthwait, of all people-being the lone exceptions).  If you like George Carlin's "angry" period, where he rails against everything without being funny, you'll like this.  If you're looking for laughs, spend your money elsewhere 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 Sorry, have saved for my trip to the Far East starting next week 
 if you wanted the whole film.  Elizabeth McGovern's (who was Oscar nominated for this) scenes were cut from this edition, in order, I imagine, for it to have a PG rating.  Buy an older VHS for the original film 
 The story here dosen't matter. The main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending. Scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction, meth. Quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless. Roberts is so gay you want to smack his face. he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity. Rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius, a role he plays better than anyone today in film. BR 
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 This is the sad story of a divorce and it's aftermath. Jeff Daniels plays another jerk who turns his sons against their mother while seducing one of his female college students. He's the stereotypical egomaniac former successful writer who turns ruthless and hostile after his wife also becomes a successful writer. He can't handle the competition and it turns his madonna/whore complex on high gear. He even fights over custody of the family pet!   If your parents are divorced this may bring back some painful repressed memories. Sadly it's the story of my generation. People with kids should watch this before divorcing. The worst part is the confustion of the boys and the distortion of the facts by their father. 
 My opinion of this book hasn't changed however my e-mail  address has 
 I bought this movie after reading the rave reviews on this site.  I have to say I was highly disappointed.  Although the 2 main characters are very likeable and their acting is good, the disco-type music in this so-called scary movie was just annoying.  I also found the 'love-scene type' music very inappropriate.  The type of music they used just made me hate the movie even more.  I was hoping for a 'haunted house' theme in this movie and it just didn't deliver.  I will give this movie 2 stars because I liked the 2 main characters.  There are no gruesome murders or anything like that in this film 
 It's an amazing phenomenon...people so smart that they are stupid.  Singer falls into that category, and I can't believe the influence this man wields.  It's mind boggling.  : /  Read this to understand his influence in our time, yes.  But don't be a sheep.  This stuff is ridiculous 
 This is a difficult book to read, not for its content but for the way is presented. I started reading this book since February and still (November)can`t find reasons to continue. There is a lot of great details and information but is all over the place. Mr. Galeano is obviously anti and he feel like the vast mayority of the problem that Latin America has faced thru the years are American made. Next time, I will try to read the Spanish version, hopefully it would be easier to digest 
  How could a book about labour ignore the most important issues of social class, race, and gender?  The book is really a collection of rah-rah essays on unions in America lacking in any analysis and rigor about the lives of workers in the U.S.  An obsequious effort to gather all perspectives without taking a position.  Why is there no critical examination of issues of race in this work?  The work does not have any essay by rank-and-file workers and seems to see the unions moving ahead by continuing in their old ways.  
 Need a quick lesson in intolerance for your child? Try this despicable & poorly written book. Totally inappropriate for this age group. Lacks any nuance, and deals only in hackneyed and offensive stereotypes. It is depressing that parents feel the need to indoctrinate their children in this way, at this age. I am an educator, and I am appalled 
 Pirsig mistakes mental illness for deep philosophical thought; he mistakes child abuse for some form of "real" child rearing.  I just read his interview in the Guardian UK.   Although it has been years since I have read this book, it still leaves an awful taste in my mouth when I think about it.  I have read philosophy from classic to contemporary; I have lived in Japan and practiced Zen archery and Zen meditation - this book has only incorrect views of Western AND Eastern philosophy yet Pirgsig, to this day thinks he has contributed to the philosophical canon. This is proof that Pirsig remains deranged.  Moreover, in the Guardian UK interview he still found the time to criticize his son who was brutally murdered; Pirsig then tries to elicit sympathy by mentioning his son's murder. Pirsig is a perfect example of someone with Narcisstic Personality Disorder.  Pirsig's son should have sought court protection from his monstrous father and largely absent and/or capitulating mother.   If you are one of the poor souls who finds something "deep" in this very large pile of verbal manure then I think therapy would be money well spent 
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 ...but Lana Wood has a very autobiographical writing style. I found Wood's memoir to be incredibly gossipy. She speaks for pages upon pages about her own feelings during pivotal times in Natalie's life. Every here or there, it's nice to have an eyewitness account of what happened at certain times, but I'd rather read about the Academy Awards for which Natalie was being nominated instead of the powerful men in Hollywood with whom Lana was sleeping. There is a lot of name-dropping as well as a lack of substance in the book's context. After reading this, I read Suzanne Finstad's NATASHA and found it to be very thorough and much more detailed about both her personal and professional life. I was not a fan of this book in any respect 
 2pac is one of the best rap artists of all time, do yourself a big favor and buy one of his earlier cds that has the real versions of tracks. The production of 2pac cds is ruining his old classics and new school horrible rap artists think they can make it because they rippd off dead 2pacs half verse like awesome man 
 I heard "The Adventure" and really liked it. I can't really say the same for the rest of the CD. A lot of people seem to love it and that's great; I'm just not one of those people. In my opinion, the songs all sound the same, and with the exception of "The Adventure" just aren't very good. It sounds like some kind of futuristic, progressive sounding experiment in music and I think it would have been better if it was just more rock. However, I would have settled for it just being more...good 
 No this is not Quantum Physics, this is just another book picking little parts of Quantum Physics, removing all the math, removing a lot of the logic, and adding poetic license.  Look, if you're interested in Quantum Physics, and REAL science, there are plenty of other books that are much better at explaining real Quantum Physics on a level most people understand.  Brian Greene has a couple very good books that do just that, No formuli either.  You may have to look up an occasional word, but if your not willing to do that, I don't understand how you're going to learn anything ever anyways.  This book is much more towards philosophy than physics.  I can agree with the first paragraph, and from there on is philosophy.  And physicists don't have 'faith' particles exist, they know they do from scientific observation.  Billions aren't invested in Particle Accelerators so scientists can get faith, that would be clearly pointless.  I'm working to my Doctorate in Physics, and when they find out I'm primarily interested in Quantum Physics I am too commonly asked what I think about beliefs that are in books like this.  If you read this, you're wasting your time. The only thing it is good for, is for the author who's making money off of whoever is foolish enough to buy it, so please, find a book with real science.  A key way you can tell is real books will often try to explain concepts with examples, the other kind of books explain things with imagery and romanticism.  
 This Rugrats movie is the worst of the three. Obviously, it was made for promotion and cash more than anything. Nickelodeon didn't consider the plot in the process, so the movie suffers. The plot is complex, yet it still manages to be too simple to be taken seriously, and it has about fifty holes and sub-plots. The movie is too complex for even a 10-year-old to grasp. Since Rugrats is aimed for 3-9 year olds, they won't get it. The main promotions for the movie were the scratch and sniff sequence [also, Burger King promotion to go with that], and the fact that Spike would now talk. Hah! Spike talked in the episode of the series about Chuckie's dreams. Besides, smelling some disgusting card [that you can smell anytime, not during the movie] isn't fun. The burger smells more like spoiled milk. Anyway, the movie is fluffy and light and tries for a few forced laughs but it dosen't happen. Debbie's well-publicized line and the "That is so wrong!" line, and the Wedgie-dance, are among the stupidest things I have ever seen. Maybe an 8-year-old would disagree. Being 12, I found the humour pretty dumb. So you're aware, I love the series. This movie just wasn't creative at all, it was more of a Thornberry-type flick. And finally, it just isn't whimsical or special in any way. Not recommended for anything except a rental from the video store, if that 
 I will start by saying that I really enjoy White's writing. I was blessed and convinced (inspite of a lifetime of brainwashing) by his King James Only Controversy. That said, I was very disappointed at his uncharitable tone towards Dr. Geisler. While Geisler focused on the scriptures, White focused on Geisler with arrogance and condescension. White put forward all the well-known verses that demonstrate election but didn't seriously try to deal with verses that clearly show human freedom. It is a difficult issue that can best be solved by letting the Bible speak for itself instead of creating dogma. If that leaves the answer unclear, so be it. It's God's book. God could have been more precise if he'd chosen to. We know what he wants us to know.  White seems to think he's more pious for screaming repeatedly, "Sovereignty!" But his approach is illogical because it holds God ultimately responsible for every evil thing that's ever happened. White denies that but can't make his denial make sense. His arguments would have been more effective if he had acknowledged the difficulty of his doctrine and not spoke as if he were so much more spiritual and/or intelligent than Geisler. 
 Geisler is a fundamentalist theologian who has written numerous apologetical and theological works.  I will admit I'm strongly prejudiced against fundamentalism, but this theologian even actively takes creation science (the belief the Earth and universe are 10,000 years old) seriously and tries to dismiss any science which disagrees with this theological view.  He is familiar with Christian theological tradition, but on the whole, his works which try to prove fundamentalist dogmas are entirely unconvincing 
 The Ying Yang Twins are so bad that it is not even funny. Now if they had talent then I could buy this CD, but that is not the case.. 
 I think Taft would have been more believable if the story was actually written by a black man.  I think it's arrogant for Patchett to think she can write in a black man's voice.  I loved The Patron Saint of Liars, but Taft was a bit of a mess 
 I picked up this book from my library because the cover looked interesting and the blurb looked interesting. The book consists more musings and less research and organization. The author begins to tell a story or talk about a myth or idea, and then jumps from topic to topic, and we never see the end of her train of thought.   I stopped reading around Chapter 3, when the book turned to the "taboo" of being a redhead in the Elizabethan era without any mention of Queen Elizabeth being a redhead - not to mention that red hair during this time was actually quite fashionable 
   This is the first review I have taken the time to write on Amazon.  This toy is as bad as others have said.  So much is wrong with the design - but the worst thing is that the reflective panels do not stay in place- I wanted to think that they MUST lock in place somehow.  Has Rainbow Art tested this product?  I was hoping to read some Amazon reviews of Digidraw to find out if anyone had a remedy for the panels slipping- The remedy is to return the toy.  I will quickly say that the reflected image is a blurry shadow - my boy's can do better freehand.  Please don't waste your money! 
 I found this book to be less than informative, and very vague when it came to waterfalls. With regard to a pond it was very good, but fell very short  of how to design, install, and maitain a waterfall. In fact the waterfall  information was on about 4 pages total. Not worth the purchase 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 This is a very different story than the one told in other books, and several news sources. That in itself is a pretty dubious fact. I will leave it at that!  There are three types of books coming out of the Afghanistan conflict - Army Books, CIA Books, and SEAL books (Forgive me but I have not seen or read and USMC/USAF books). All charges of bias aside, it is natural for the author to write about that which he knows - CIA guys tend to focus own universe etc. My point in all of this is: this, is undoubtably a SEAL book.   If you are looking to fill in some blanks from resources available in print, or online by all means pick this up. If you are looking for a more definitive look at Anaconda - I would check out 'Not a Good Day to Die' by Sean Naylor 
 I received my book a few days ago. I must say I was kind of disappointed. To pay $23.95 + shipping for a small paperback book with mostly black and white pictures. I think the book will be a good read and provide me with some good tips, but I think most of the pictures should have at least been in color to really get the ideas across and easy to see. I guess I thought that even though it was a paperback that it would be a larger book with better pictures. 
 Funny people have it bad. When they're actually making you laugh they're fine. When they're failing to make you laugh they come off as desperate, flailing nerds. I was a huge fan of Stranger with Candy whose writing was incisive and brutally funny. Less so with the Book of Liz, and even less so with this book. Sedaris, Colbert & Dinello are funny people but this is an embarassment. It's abundantly clear now that they require a format (ripe for a send-up) to shine. Was there a 2nd draft or was this a cash-in for their agents? Every joke in this nervous-to-please dud is a throwaway. A tiresome type of joke starts on page 1. By page 2 you've detected the formula and by page 3 it's just grating. The plot is the flimsiest possible structure three smart asses can bounce bad puns & jokes off of. It quickly collapses. I could not complete it but I suspect the book ends up being lightweight crap. When you commit to nothing but your own funniness you never get around to questions of merit. This is a desperately nerdy book, just as the posed "funny" pictures suggest. (I've never seen less funny pictures...) Who was the intended audience for this? The dumbest person I know has a more sophisticated funny bone than this.  There's wit and then there's corn. This is a whole crop of the latter. Leave time for your own groaning if you plan to read the whole thing 
 Mr. O'Nan should have taken a refresher course in basic writing.  His skipping and skimming and throwing to and fro people, events, etc., is downright frustrating and confuses the project.  Unlike superior literary treatments (see Walter Lord's TITANIC), this book leave you with more questions than anything else and the urge to take a long, hot shower.  
 Well in my opinion, there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies, and some people have had some unusual experiences (mostly disturbing, but some apparrently enlightening), but the question is, is it all as it seems?  The fact of the matter is, various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us.  Holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys (this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events); there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario; advanced, drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now (Verichip).  I'm not saying that other lifeforms don't exist in the Universe (far from it), and perhaps there are a number of entities here on Earth carrying out agendas, but this idea that there are little, menacing Greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense COLLUSION seems suspect.  It smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us.  Historically, there's been the Barbarians, Huns, Mongols,  Pagans, Jews, Christians, Vikings, black Natives, Cannabals, red Natives, Mexicans, Germans, Nazis, Communists, now the Arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on Earth.  Even President Reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80's.  The fact is that with known technology (not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked), they could quite easily pull the hoax off.  Even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and PRACTICED (albeit "underground") than most people can fathom.  What has become another fact is the major extent to which the UFO community has been infiltrated and compromised, of which Strieber has been front and centre at various times.  My belief is that Strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign, sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups.  In this book, his "hard-evidence" is flimsey and suspicious.  For example, why wouldn't super advanced Aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue (thus not showing up on any X-ray, MRI, CT, etc)?  And design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body?  Surely, this would be child's play for Alien scientists?  Why no major discussion or mention of the human military, or NAZI connection with abductions?  There seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange "fragments" of memories that are slipping through various memory covers.  Why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the Greys?  Why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms?  Why are some speaking English, others German?  Why is there a connection with deep, underground bases and specifically Antartica?  These are things Strieber never mentions, which I find curious.  My point is, things are happening, but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what, and Strieber's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas.       
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 Look I know Full Moon went under but who knew that the next time we'd see the Puppet Master dolls it would be this awful? The plot is worse than even the worst of the Puppet Master original series titles, the acting makes the Full Moon actors look like Oscar Winners and the puppets aren't even close to the real deal!  I guess the easiest question I have is, Why even buy the rights to a franchise if you're not going to use the signatures of the franchise in the first film you make with it? Blade, Six Shooter, Jester, Pinhead are replicated in this movie so poorly it looks as if an 8 year old art student made them. Pinhead's hands even appear to be clay.  Worse is the movements. They don't have any of the fluent movements that were trademark to how the puppets looked real and there are scenes where there are massive amounts of strings showing everywhere. It's embarrassing to say the least.  The puppets weren't talkers before but they made sounds. This time they were completely mute. I wish I could have said the same for Corey Feldman who used to know how to act but in this movie comes off so over the top it's impossible to care about him or feel any sense of empathy for his character oncesoever. Most of the time you're wishing you had a gun to shoot yourself with so you could end his speaking parts.  The Demonic Toys look different and if possible even more cheap than before also. Full Moon might not have had the greatest actors, scripts or special effects but they usually spent a sufficient amount of time, money and energy on making the dolls (the stars of their movies) look good.   There is another small glitch in this movie that will annoy the fans of the Puppet Master franchise. Somehow Toulon's blood is needed for the formula to keep the dolls alive. The formula is now injected into holes in the back of the puppet's necks. For casual fans this is not a big deal, for longtime fans they know Toulon's blood had nothing to do with the formula and in part Three Toulon clearly injects them in the front of the neck area in a way that made it clear that as long as they got an injection, the puppets were fine.  Vanessa Angel is not a bad actress and has a million dollar body but she's stuck in a role and a movie that screams "I just want to collect a paycheck".   The Puppet Master theme music is blatantly absent as is the entire feel of the Full Moon series. The actors are horrible and seem to have to pause through lines in order to spit out the script they were supposed to remember and although the Demonic Toys franchise is much smaller I'm sure their fans felt disrespected by how marginalized their toys were to Angel's character, Sharpe.  Full Moon had this project announced before they folded. If only they had completed this then and not let Sci Fi skimp and cheat their way into trashing two beloved cult franchises with one movie that is so blatantly bad that it even loses the appeal of goofy and cheesy that so many second and third rate horror films fall into.  Avoid at all costs if you like either series 
 I adored Walker's The Color Purple, so when I pulled her book The Temple of My Familiar off a friend's shelf, I looked forward to an entertaining and elucidating time.  Unfortunately, the book was disappointing.  Most readers - and certainly all writers - are familiar with the maxim, "Show, don't tell."  Walker breaks this fundamental rule and has characters telling for the entire book.  For the most part, the characters sound like each other.  For the most part, the listeners sit by, accepting, unquestioning, drinking in the words and stories as if they are the most profound wisdom, their mouths as wide open as if they were baby birds, never disagreeing with or challenging what is told them.  Perhaps this is how Walker intends these views to be taken, however, remaining in a state of awe for more than 400 pages is difficult for a reader.  Besides - although I find her viewpoint interesting, which emphasizes the importance of the Goddess and the idea that all would be much better if black women ruled the world - I can't agree with it. I think that the majority of whites - admittedly, not all - don't spend their time these days thinking about how to keep black people down.  Many of us cheer when blacks do well - a successful black person is much better for society than a black who is poor and unhappy - just as we cheer when other the people of other races do well.  Perhaps I would have appreciated the story more if I could have sighed and said, "how true" - but I could not.  However, the real problem in The Temple of My Familiar is not what Walker is saying, but how she is saying it.  Furthermore, the book itself is complicated and convoluted, with tangled relationships between the characters.  And I don't mean that the relationships are emotionally complex, just that there are lots of aunts and uncles and difficult-to-diagram genealogical charts, as well as some confusion as to who is sleeping with whom.  Furthermore, the characters never seem to touch each other, again, because Walker tells instead of shows.  We are told that they are happy or that they are sad or that they are moved - but we don't feel it, because we are told instead of shown.  There are glimmers of brilliance.  The opening is wonderful - possibly because Walker was showing instead of telling at this point, and because at this point the cast of characters is small and manageable.    
 If I ever make it through the second half I might take one back.  I thought of "Bill Maher" when I read the title.  I thought this would be a funny read not a religious one.  Luckily you are not buying in haste and have the foresight to read reviews.  If you are a Christian and hate Evolution, or any other part of science that contradicts your religion, this will be an enjoyable read.  I just could not find this person nor some of his sources credible.  A lovely twisting of facts.    Enjoy 
 It is apparent that the first premise in Peck's book is that in order for humans to be a whole being, one must grow through spirituality (or enlightenment) attained through "grace" with the main purposes of gaining "capacity and understanding of serendipity" (309) and through "spiritual evolution, whereby people grow towards godhood" (270) and "become God" (283).    The second premise is that if a person is to be a complete being, one must possess a certain amount of "freedom" and grow in the capacity of love.  Freedom can be through several avenues such as sexual "self-expression and exploration" (147).    Peck's premises are secular in nature, mainly concentrating on one's self.  He confuses the true God with a man-made form of a god.  Peck instructs readers not to conform to a particular religion, but inundates them with own "religion," which is a mixture of pseudo-Christian philosophies, Eastern mysticism, and post-modern thoughts.  One of the ways he does this is by quoting Bible verses out of context.    Peck's version of love is a free-for-all deficient of morality and decency.  Sexual intimacy is devoid of commitment through a covenant marriage, and reduces it to a spontaneous animalistic act.  In fact, love is his excuse for sexual transgression of the therapist-client relationship.    It is a sad situation in our society when Peck's book becomes a bestseller.  A "road less traveled" offers what the general population desires to hear: find your own way and do as you please.  
 The already best-selling Block (he of the Matt Scudder series and others) seems to have decided to write something aimed at  "block-buster bestseller"dom for the beach-reading crowd, and adopted all the tropes of the type -- hot kinky sex, picnic-basket-busting length (541 closely printed paperback pages), unlikely connections between overblown characters each with a mini-biography, etc.   This is especially annoying since I had just finished an early (perhaps the first) Matt Scudder novel, "The Sins of the Fathers", a taut, clean read if there ever was one.    There is an interesting plot lurking in here somewhere, and we get a taste of what could have been when the book starts out with a bang -- gay, recovering-addict  Jerry Pankow is making the morning rounds of his cleaning service -- a few bars, a whorehouse, a few apartments -- when he stumbles on a body.  We're getting to know and like Jerry, sympathize with his somewhat silly situation (he'd done a masterful job of cleaning/ruining the crime scene), and want to find out what's next when ... bang ... we're in Susan Pomerance's art gallery.  And so on ... there are at least six virtually co-equal ensemble characters who have to be juggled: in addition to Jerry and Susan, the hyper-sexed art dealer, there are Francis J Buckman, ex police comish, Maury Winters, the best damn lawyer in the city, not-yet-famous author John Blair Creighton, and of course our friendly serial killer, The Carpenter.  At best it's hard to keep this many characters straight (for reader or author), but Block has a habit of not using names when switching viewpoints, and there are probably another half dozen or so characters who get nearly equal treatment, at least for one or two appearances.    Long passages of backstory and flashback (not just for the major characters, but for seemingly every spear carrier) drag the pace of the plot, and are often confusingly mixed with the baseline action or thoughts.  We even get the life history of a restaurant owner where several characters eat, drink and flirt, an intersting story admittedly but contributing nothing to the plot but distraction.  We also find out way too much about each character's stream of what-passes-for-consciousness.    And a final whinge -- it is never explained why the cops didn't find the rabbit, a big glaring 800 pound gorilla lurking in the background for almost half the book.  Or maybe that was intentional, since, according to the reviews, his Matt Scudder book "All the Flowers are Dying" continues from loose ends in this book.    That said, there is a sort of interesting plot hidden among the great gobs of flab, and the book eventually does get moving, even exciting ... about page 400.  And the hot kinky sex is, well, hot kinky sex, and keeps the pages turning where the plot doesn't.  And Block is a dang good writer, in a page-by-page sense, so there are plenty of well written passages.  This could have been an good book at half the length, though maybe that would have made some flaws more apparent.  
 When I the reviews to this book I thought to myself: this is going to be the read of the summer. So naturally, I went to my local bookstore and paid $24.00. A few hours later, I went back and returned it. It was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere. I don't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless, with no execuse for its swearing. Literature isn't trash, Mr. Carey. 
 This checklist book has some photographs of homes that were OK but the checklist and text part of the book was much too basic. None of the parts of a home inspection were revealed or included in this book. So it is NOT a worksheet with 111 checklists but only a very basic and simple guide. I could not recommend this to anyone. Get another book that has a more complete checklist that you can use and that is helpful. You will never be able to do a home inspection from using this checklist book. If you did then you will be risking a lot since you will not know what to check out and inspect if this book is your guide!!! 
 After watching Spirited Away I was excited to watch other movies by the same director. Unfortunately every movie seems to be an excuse to preach his simplistic "it's bad to hate" message. What the creators of Princess Mononoke and others like them refuse to admit is that hate is a natural reaction and even healthy when directed towards the destructive, disgusting things of the world. Yes, hate can become overly consuming, just as any other emotion can overcome us, or we an hate the good things of the world making us the bad one's,(just as loving that which is evil wouldn't be a good thing)  but placed in its proper context at the proper time, at that which deserves hate helps us avoid dangers and deal with certain problems. And the people who claim that hate is all-evil themselves hate the "haters", which I find comical.    The movie also has strong pro feminist/anti man messages.     I wanted to like this film but I don't appreciate being duped into listening to people rant and rave about nonsense 
 At last!  I can say that I know what a castrato being tortured with a power drill while an infinite number of monkeys scrape an infinite number of fingernails across an infinite number of blackboards sounds like.  Thanks, Mandy 
 Bill does a good job here explaining the problems with the current morality of American's but other then that,   he sounds as if he is constantly trying to uphold his beliefs on us, continually bitching about people who do not choose to appear on the the o-reilly-factor, and downing everyone who has a bad word to say about him..   he claims he is not conservative, yet this book shows his support for almost every republican in power..  (who in there right MIND can say that george bush genuinely cares for our country?!) and defines himself to be 'with the working-class..'   POSER! 
 I had high hopes for this book. I was sorely disappointed. The author kept going on and on with his theories about why the Roman Empire collapsed. Every time I thought he was about to get around to some IRISH history, he went back to Rome, or some other culture. I can understand setting the stage, but this was ridiculous. Halfway through, I gave up, skimmed the rest of the book, and decided it wasn't worth the time 
 I read the preceding Malloren books simply to get to Rothgar's story.  He is my kind of guy - dark, brooding, and completely in control.  I so wanted him to fall and fall hard.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the way his story played out.  Diana was supposed to be a fiercely independent, strong-willed woman.  However, almost from the start, she pines after Rothgar and all but begs him to have sex with her.  She was an extremely disappointing mate for Rothgar...he should have ended up with someone HE needed to chase.  The whole point would have been that he finally wanted something badly enough to fight for it.  For my taste there was WAY too much political information in this book.  I actually skimmed some pages because they were so mired in the politics of that time.    Jo Beverley's books may be too much history and too little romance for me.  Her characters never really grab me and hold on to me like others have.  There is simply not enough emotion and true love for my taste.  
 I agree with much that Mr. Johnson observes regarding the decline of the  American empire but I feel his work is intentionally misleading for people who do not understand some fundamental concepts about the United States of America.    As early as page 8, the contradictions begin.  On this one page, Johnson points out that George W. Bush "lost the popular vote" then later makes the claim that treaties signed by the US constitute "the law of the land" and he cites a passage from the constitution to back up his assertion.  Well, as anyone who understands our Constitution would point out, the Constitution makes no provision what-so-ever for a national popular vote. So to use Mr. Johnson's own words against him, so long as the Constitution has any meaning, talk about a "popular vote" is an elitist manipulation of  people he must expect will not know the difference.  It appears that Mr. Johnson relies heavily on using tidbits of fact interspersed with populist misconceptions about our government to stir the pot and tip voter sentiment towards socialism.  I'm sure Rosie O'Donnell's audience will lap this up. Jahfre the libertaria 
 It was truly a pleasure hearing Lang Lang in his Carnegie Hall debut several years ago playing the Grieg Piano Concerto, accompanied by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra with distinguished conductor Yuri Temirkanov at the podium. Alas, the same could not be said for his Carnegie Hall recital debut in Stern Auditorium, of which this CD was recorded partly live, and then, afterwards, in a studio recording inside an empty Stern Auditorium. Regrettably, this CD reflects all of Lang Lang's flaws, with his only virtue being his superb technical brilliance at the keyboard. Indeed, he plays 18th Century Classical and 19th Century Romantic piano music with all the flamboyance of an early 1970s Elton John, even with his own somewhat flamboyant sartorial elegance in a rather outlandish Mao jacket that he wore on stage.  I was cringing and shaking my head as he performed Haydn as though it was composed by Schumann and then, Schubert and Schumann as if their works had been composed by Prokofiev and Rachmaninov. In plain English, Lang Lang played these works without showing much understanding or compassion for these scores, emphasizing the exuberance of an Argerich or Uchida, without knowing that their exuberant styles are coupled with a deeper understanding for the works they are playing. The worst travesty was Schubert's "Wanderer" Fantasy, which I have heard played with much grace and style - either recorded or on stage - from the likes of Brendel, Kempff, Perahia and Schiff, to name but a few; however in Lang Lang's hands it had all the swagger and technical brilliance of Elton John playing "Bennie and the Jets".  Lang Lang needs to show more sensitivity and understanding of the works he is playing before I will listen to him again, either on stage or on a recording. I am amazed that Deutsche Grammophon is investing so much of its publicity on him when there are other, more mature artists such as violinist Hilary Hahn and pianists Yundi Li and Helene Grimaud who deserve such recognition. If I wish to hear Elton John play classical music, I'll see him and his band perform the next time they play at Madison Square Garden or Radio City Music Hall or see his superb DVD of his Royal Academy of Music fundraising concert at London's Royal Opera Hall once more; I won't bother hearing Lang Lang perform like Elton John at Carnegie Hall. So my recommendation is to skip this recording and buy those from the likes of Brendel, Kempff, Perahia, Schiff and Uchida for classical piano music or buy instead one of Elton John's live concert performance CDs or DVDs 
 A disappointing purchase, this cannot be the last word on the subject.  The book is a pretty dry read. Bill James has printed similar types of essays in various books in a much more lively and entertaining style.  Also, some of the methods used and assumptions made are very questionable. (I am an MBA with over 20 years experience in compiling and using statistical data.)  Felber's book can only be recommended to the really hardcore fan who is willing to wade through a lot of really boring prose 
 What it this? Disney's original animated film `The Jungle Book' was made in 1967, and after almost 40 years they released a sequel `The Jungle Book 2.' What is the point of doing this anyway?  To be fair, the sequel is not a horrible film. It has more colors (more light colors in the jungle) and comes with the original's exhilarating `Bare Necessities.' Who can dislike this song? And the introductory part using stick puppets is cleverly done, letting us into the world of the wild child Mowgli and his friends.  But after that, about 10 minutes or so, the film suddenly starts to look not-so-ambitious attempt to re-tell the story of the original, which should have been ended 40 years ago. In this sequel Mowgli, who is fed up with the rules of the village, goes back to the jungle where his friend big bear Baloo is living and dancing to that charming song alone. Now Baloo is happy to meet the boy again for he is lonely and needs a partner to do the musical number.  But we are not so happy. That is partly because their reunion virtually ignores the original film's conclusion, and partly because we know the same story has just begun again. The difference between the 1967 version and this one is that Shanti also steps into the jungle with a little boy Ranjan, but this slight difference means little to us because both of them are quite unmemorable.   After all, the problem is not the fact that the story of `The Jungle Book 2' in fact retreads that of the original because few people would still remember the details of the film made 40 years ago. The real drawback is that in `JB2' nothing interesting happens except the last 10 minutes where the bad tiger tries to kill Mowgli. The film provides musical scenes (which are decent themselves), but they only stretch the thin story. Even though I love the song Bare Necessities, I don't want to listen to it three times in a short film that only runs 72 minutes.  To me (I am living in Japan) the most shocking thing about the film is that like the so-so film `Return to Neverland' `The Jungle Book 2' was originally made for video, and then was chosen for theatrical release in USA and UK. That they can do such a thing is as unaccountable as the company's choice of the material for the sequel 
 The only things wrong with this book are the setting, characters, plot, and conclusion.  I can't ever remember not finishing a book, but I became so bored with The Templar Legacy about 2/3rds of the way through that I skipped to the end to see how it ended, and I still have no desire to go back and read the parts I skipped.  The characters are not developed, and not believable.  I was particularly put off by the bat-woman like, muslim woman who is fabulously wealthy, funding a 30 year construction of a medieval castle using only medievel techniques, and obsessed with the origins of Christianity; and the aged dutch billionaire who pops in whenever needed to save the day with his wealth.  Even the dead leader of the Knights Templar, who accurately predicted every action that the entire cast would take for weeks after his death, and planned what would happen.  It really didn't work, and I never cared about any of them.  I'd like to continue but writing about it is making me mad that I paid for this drivel.  Before you try this book, try something by Bernard Cornwell, I have been enjoying his books lately 
 There is no doubt that Mercator was a great geographer. Among his achievements were: the projection bearing his name, the first modern Atlas, and even the naming of North America. He played an important role in the amazing successes and adventures of the Age of Discovery. He truly was an amazing man.  Having said this, I found Crane's book to be lacking. I thought that the book was well researched and well grounded, but the delivery was poor. When buying a popular history book, in addition to the facts I expect a gripping story, masterfully told. However, Crane's writing style is dry and while the book is filled with names, dates, facts and figures the story telling is simply not there. Crane often gets bogged down in minute details that are distracting, dry and are simply not important to the story he is trying to tell.  In short, this may be a good history book, but it is not a book that I would recommend for the typical reader of POPULAR history 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 I read this book in French. The quotes are my translation and the page refs are to the French edition. The book is quite short. It brings together the edited text of two talks Bourdieu gave on French TV in March 1996, and an article on the same topic from March 94. The topic is not really television, but rather the effect of TV on journalism. The foreword ends, p. 8: "...I hope [my analyses] will help supply tools or weapons to those who, in the image trade itself, are fighting in to prevent what could have been a formidable instrument for direct democracy from turning into an instrument of symbolic oppression."  If this sounds sensible to you, then read the book, you may appreciate it. Moreso if you also have a taste for comments on the French lit-TV scene. (In France, lit-TV at the time took some of the space occupied in the US by political talk shows. It's half disappeared since then.)  To me, however, the quote sounds Pollyanna. (You read it here first, "Bourdieu has his Pollyanna side".) With a large helping of naïveté, it could have been reality-based back when The Honeymooners was the talk of the town (ask you grandma). Or, more to the point, when Dan Rather first stepped into a TV station. The spirit of the whole book, unfortunately, is faithful to the sentence.   It's not that there is nothing to learn, here and there, from Bourdieu's remarks. It's that at best the pickings would simply fill a scrapbook. They define no particular social phenomenon and no particular aspect of the TV domain in modern society. The book *claims* to be about television, but this is television minus the money shots (aka ads), the soaps, the sports, the generic talk shows, the kids' programming -- TV minus everything but news and public affairs, TV reduced the part where "journalists" get paychecks. Furthermore, while, at the time Bourdieu was writing TV, had been the dominant news source in France for almost as long as it had been in the US, this dominant journalism is measured by the standard of print journalism (which then as now was slipping faster in France than in the US). The French have a word for this, passéisme, past-ism.  The meager theoretical contribution in the book (mostly near the end of the second talk, and in the appended article) concerns the "effets de champ" in journalism, what in America would probably be called systemic effects, and especially their extent (emprise) within the field. Dan Rather's end-of-career misfortune will teach you more, and with a better grounding in reality.  One star because this is definitely in the lower quintile of what one would expect from Bourdieu on television.  
 Doyles section is basically the same and is why it got 2 stars in the first place. I feel the poker pros were not used properly for this book. Daniel negranu is a coward for  doing three card draw that has no merit on real card tables and he should of just declined it in the first place,he is a no limit and omaha 8 or better expert and should of wrote on that instead. Bobby baldwin was the most sound poker player during his time, kind of like alan cunningham of today. So I dont know why he didnt write the limit chapter again,  I think modern day limit players would have really been in for a treat. I have nothing against jeniffer harmen writing it but I think it was better served for baldwin. Please save your money and dont buy this book. If need be they should have it at your local library 
 I had a crush on a chick that liked this cd....then i found out how she was....hmmm oh yeah slut! anyway yeah garbage good thing i never considered buying or downloading any of her music....oops she did it again create a garbage. Oh and to add on for my not so well absent minded avril lavigne fan. "which sucks" she bought the cd and got spyware on her computer.....thanks again britney!!!  P.S: Another girls gone wild britney and madonna....lma 
 Despite an interesting title and a beguiling title page, I honestly found nothing exceptional about Robin McKinley's collection of four fairytales. Whether her stories are original or retold, they are rather dull, predictable, and written with long-winded language that makes for sluggish reading. All are centred on the interactions between this world and that of Faerieland - or to be more specific, the interactions between young princesses and the inhabitants of Faerieland. None of these girls are individuals, instead they are cast straight from the princess stereotype and all the stories end on a slightly sickly-sweet note with each dilemma that the girls' face wrapped up in a nice little bow. Faerieland is not seen as a wild and elusive place, but as a pretty sparkling land with none of the depth or hidden meaning that fairytales are meant to have. They are sweet, pretty, *pointless* tales have nothing of the ambiguity or beauty that they could.  In "The Stolen Princess", McKinley tells the tale of one of the last kingdoms that border the realm of Faery, and the anxiety that the residents face concerning the possible stealing of their children. This happened to the Queen's twin sister Ellian, and now the same thing has happened to happen to their only child Linadel. The King and Queen take it upon themselves to rescue their daughter, whilst she herself awakens in the Faerie realm to greet its inhabitants. The pacing of the story is extremely slow, the "love-at-first-sight" scenario is entirely unconvincing, and the descriptions of Faerieland are unimaginative and flat - it sounds like quite a dull place actually.  "The Princess and the Frog" is a retelling of the princess who drops her golden ball and has it returned to her by a frog. Here, the Princess Rana is saved from the malevolent power of an unwelcome suitor's necklace by a talking frog. The ending is utterly preposterous: the frog returns to his human form, and challenges the suitor Aliyander - at this stage Rana runs out of the room, down to the pond, fills a flagon with its water and rushes back to dump the whole lot on Aliyander. Presumably, since no other explanation is given, we are meant to suppose that during this lengthy interlude of running and fetching water, the two foes simply stood looking at each other, since when Rana returns neither one of them has moved. Furthermore, how Rana knows that the pond-water will destroy Aliyander is completely unexplained, and therefore comes across as random and bizzare.  "The Hunting of the Hind" is possibly the only worthwhile read, which tells of Princess Korah, whose kingdom is plauged by the beauty of a golden hind, the very sight of which drives men into madness. When this terrible affliction lands upon her beloved brother, Korah herself goes out in search of the hind to learn its secrets. However, this story too comes to an annoying ending: the hind is under a spell, which can only be broken if a person goes to the wizard who placed the curse and asks him to remove it. But to prevent the wizard from using your inner emotions against you, one must enter his presence completely devoid of any feelings. So Korah leaves her inner emotions in the keeping of the transformed hind (err, how exactly?) and asks the wizard for her freedom. That's it. I was expecting some sort of twist, some sort of test or trick that the young girl must go through, but no - that's it. To top it off, McKinley throws in a brother to the golden hind to act as love-interest for Korah - why must every Princess land herself a hubby in the course of her adventures? Can't she just have the adventure for its own sake?  Lastly is the longest story, "The Twelve Dancing Princesses" which is told from the point of view of a middle-aged soldier, and is made all the better for it - by this stage I was thoroughly tired of McKinley's flat princess-heroines. The soldier takes up the challenge of solving the mystery of the twelve princesses, whose shoes appear each morning entirely worn out, as if they have been dancing all the night long. If you have read this old fairytale, then there is nothing here that will surprise you - McKinley tells the exact same story, except she takes twice as long to do it. There is a slight shadow of intrigue with the appearance of an old woman who aids the soldier, but it's not enough to warrant the energy I used in dragging myself through this story.  As you can see, this is a rather harsh review, and if you happen to be Robin McKinley reading this - no offence! McKinley is a gifted author, and I have enjoyed many of her books, but this collection just left me entirely unsatisfied. I've tried to give legitimate reasons as to why this is simply isn't a worthwhile book, without simply ranting at it, and the truth is that it just felt completely devoid of any real magic or passion. 
 10-14 years ago Harry Connick Jr seemed to be on His Way at making His own oath Musically&He was tapping into a Sinatra zone of presentation&Overall vibe.but somewhere in the middle of the 90's Harry Connick Jr went to Being a Cat on a Mission to a Guy trying to Being a Jack of all trades&in the overall process seems just like a Mere footnote which is truly a waste just like  the first track on this set.His voice&Presentation hasn't evolved much at all&unlike a Decade ago Harry can't just have a cool run&bring you back in.at this stage of the Game Connick is just getting by&can do this for as long as there is folks willing to go along but will He ever challenge Himself again?

 not worth spending any money on. stick to third world cop and dancehall queen if you want to watch a good jamaican movie 
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
  I first heard about this book in a graduate level Latin American survey course.  I kept it in the back of my mind and finally got around to reading it years later.  The professor had described it glowingly and subsequent references to it that I came across were all very positive.  Consequently I really looked forward to reading this book.  I was extremely disappointed.  Published in 1938 I would say that overall the book has aged badly.  It is overly dramatic, even emotionally silly in parts. The plot is insipid.  The Mexican characters are not Mexican but European with a little Mexican airbrushing.  The indigenous people are portrayed as one-dimensional simians.    I read that prior to writing the book Graham Greene spent a total of eight weeks in Mexico.  It sadly shows.   He has little understanding of Mexico.  I can't understand the continuing hoopla surrounding this work.  If you want to read some decent fiction about early twentieth century Mexico try something by B. Traven. 
 For years I have avoided Jodi Picoult novels and if this one is typical, with good reason.  For my book club, I am plowing through the nauseating minuate that bulks this novel to over 400 pages.  The constant, brief shifts in first-person narration are too fast and give views on characters, such as a judge who likes show tunes, that are irrelevant to the novel at the expense of more fully developing the title character.  The first-person narration works for important characters but otherwise I think the author is using an easy narrative device to propel the action of her novel, which is, even with this technique, infuriatingly slow and has the effect of jarring the reader every page or two as one must determine the narrator yet again.    Also, the focus on the child-custody battle removes attention from who I think is the most interesting character--the child Faith.  If one can get past the didactic symbolism of the name Faith White, and the constant phrasing such as "here is a story about faith" (p. 275) followed by "he'll do whatever is in his power to make sure I keep Faith," (p.291), which makes me cringe at each repetition, the child seeing or hearing God is, to me, the most interesting aspect of the plot but one that receives little attention.    Overall, I think this novel is heavy-handed, overly descriptive and replete with such obvious symbolism and detail it makes my eyes hurt. The characters never seem real and I never sympathize with any of their easily predictable reactions and emotions, but find the potential of the plot is never fully realized in any engaging way. Try a different novel- many others dealing with religion exist that are far better written and much more interesting 
 I was never more disappointed in any book I read.  The story went directly from the eve of invasion by the aliens to "Oh, my, they're here!"  with no explination no how they got here.  The book was also more concerned with the characters sex life.  They spendt 90% of their time having sex, with the aliens forcing their captives to have sex, because they didn't reproduce sexually and were doing 'research'.  Even earth people who weren't in captivity seemed to spend most of their time having sex.  I will never read any by Mr. Turtledove again 
 This movie was so extremely boaring.  I made it to the part where he said, "I think I'm pregnant," then turned it off.  Get this guys it took a complete 45 minutes for him to find a tooth in a wall and another 15 minutes to dress in drag and say, "I think I'm pregnant."  I understand the story line completely, after girl supposedly kills herself her neighbors try to make the new tenant be like her in every way, shape, and form.  This film deserves below a star, it has no suspence, no action, no terror, no real mystery, just boaring talking through atleast the fist hour of the film... I didn't care enough to finish it 
 This book is simply awful. I gave up after a hard slog through ninety percent of this dreck. The author simply can't write. It sounds callous, but after enduring this book I feel less sympathy towards the yound Marines fighting and dying in Iraq. No wonder they call them grunts. I made a resolution long ago to never read books by the enlisted and this book reinforced that. That Mark Bowden of Black Hawk Down fame endorsed this book is unfathomable to me. Read 'A Rumor of War' by Philip Caputo if you want a superbly-written account of war. On the other hand, if you want to waste time and money, read Jarhead 
 I like Metallica first of all. But this was their worst release along with Kill Em All. All the songs on this album are really horrendous. Metallica only made about a few good albums, want to get one???? Get Master of Puppets, Black, and Ride The Lightning. They all have about 3-7 good songs. This album is a waste!!!! Get those albums insted 
  As previously stated, the colors are not quite right. Also, my son wore it for only fifteen minuets when we noticed the stitching comming apart down the back seam. He should have at least gotten a whole Halloween's worth out of it 
 Excellent book for anyone interested in drawing the human figure.  Deals well and extensively with proportion, anatomy and nuances of figure drawing.  Required by my art teacher and worth the money as an on-going reference source 
 It's not funny, unless you're a moron. It's not suspenseful. The "mystery" is predictable to anyone who has seen more than one television suspense show. The characters are hollow. The interaction is tedious. And despite some hopeful signs of drug use, there are no hallucinations or grand insights. In fact, this book is entropy, resurfaced, and should be recycled immediately so we can print something more stimulating on the pulp, like perhaps instruction manuals for screwdrivers 
 My fiancee is originally from Thailand and I recently visited there and stayed with her family and friends.  As I was taken around by native people, I got a different perspective than many who travel there.  This guide could have benefitted greatly from a lot more Thai involvement in this production.  It seems to rely much on the poorly worded English translations at many of the sites.  Worse, it is sometimes rather snobby in its comments, such as by describing the amazing life and works of the Princess Mother (and the incredible palace she lived in at Doi Tung that was just stunning) as "On the theory that local hill tribes would be so honored by a royal prescence that they would stop cultivating opium, the late Princess mother built the Doi Tung Royal Villa." In actuality, the Princess Mother led an amazing life by any accounts.  As another example, it misses some of the temples that can easily be seen when crossing over into Myanmar, and instead unhelpfully states that there is little to see.  These comments can cause travelers to miss some of the most beautiful and interesting places.  However, I did find it useful in terms of helping me to identify places as sometimes my Thai friends had difficulty completely explaining in English.  Using the Lonely Planet allowed me to take some notes so that I could later research the full history of a place, which was definitely helpful.  I just wish this guide would itself contain the information.  However, it is the best out there as I found other guides to simply not be as comprehensive 
 I travel 2-3 weeks a month for work and I needed a hairdryer that was better than the 1000 watt hotel dryers, so after some research I decided to purchase the travel-size T3.   During the first time I used it, it started smoking and the coils in the back flared up and caught on fire. (There were actual flames -- although they quickly burned out)  I took the dryer back to Sephora and I was quickly given a replacement.  While I had dryer #2, I noticed that it took 15-20 minutes to dry my hair, when it usually takes 20-30. However, I have the full size T3 at home and it takes about 10 minutes when I use that one.  I was expecting this to offer the same power as the other T3.  The bottom line is that I didn't notice a big difference between the travel T3 and the hotel hairdryers that are built into the bathrooms.   After 6 months, the handle broke on the 2nd hairdryer making it rather challenging to use.   If you want a great hairdryer, buy a full size T3, Elchim or Chi Pro -- if you need something to travel with, you're better off with finding space for the full size model. 
 This book has a bad habit of being weak and juvenille.  Very weak and ordinary. G 
 I knew after 1983 things would never be the same with Rock and Roll ever again. The music was becoming more clean sounding with technology more or less replacing the majority of musicians. This would be one of the first ones. I remember hearing the first single from this which was "Little Red Corvette" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is "Let's Pretend We're Married". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was "Delirious". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical? I just am appalled at the way music wound up, and it all started here 
 of every band/group, there is always the weak link, Tony Yayo proves that he is the one with Thoughts Of A Predicate Felon.  Many of the songs are not produced by Dr. Dre (one of the few things that G-Unit has going for them) resulting in "greasy" and bad beats.  Tony Yayo cant seem to trun his mouth away from drug trafficing, being locked up in prison, hoes, ect.  He lyrics aren't all that great either, making him have the worst voice in G-unit as well.  He sounds almost as if he is my grandfather- maybe as a result of getting locked up.  The few pluses on the album are "Drama Setter" feat. Eminem and Obie Trice followed by Eminem's constant adreniline rushing sound and beats (even though he only is apart of the chorus-a big mistake) as well as "G-S**t".  My advice, download these two songs- this CD isn't worth $14.00 
 I hate to give a less than stellar review but this book had nonew information for me.  This is not the book for you if you've readother garden books or consider yourself an experienced gardener. Sometimes I just get one tidbit from a book that's useful, that's fine.  This book was a real dud for me.  EN 
 Not helpful for me.  It contained mostly definitions of terms, no useful follow thru information.  Other books I have found are more percise.  
 Listen, I have bought several of these book lights, every time they break. It is not the bulb, or the plug or the batteries, it is the wiring. Don't bother. I am currently on search and destroy for a new book light that will last longer then 5 days and wont hurt my eyes. Any suggestions 
 This is an album just full of bubble-gum pop songs. If you actually hear music, don't buy this. And her little shrill in Go on and Cry is horrible.  Better luck next time. If there is a next time 
 I'm giving this book such a low rating because of the ridiculous price. I bought it and read it a few years ago and I never feel the need to make reference to it. I question the actual value of the exercises. Recently when I was doing basic military training, I was doing some small knee circles before morning pt. One of the medical officers in my platoon walked over to me and said "stop that, that won't do a thing for you". For what I paid to read about this technique, that should have been the last thing on the mind of a medical professional. 
 The quality of the recording on the Audio Series is very poor. It distracted from the message. I was expecting this to be a audio version of portions of the book, but instead they are poor recordings of his sermons. Tape 2 of 3 was a recording of someone besides Tommy Tenney 
 There is nothing practical about this book. It is a looooong, purely theoretical torture with only a few examples that don't work too well in the real world. I had to buy it for one of my graduate classes and here I am three months later even more clueless than I was when I started. This book is very boring, painful to read. It doesn't help that the author is clearly biased in favor of traditional HRM and refuses to give much room to more modern thinking. The exercise book is a nightmare. The exercises are either impossibly difficult and time-consuming because the textbook does not offer valuable guidance for any practical problems, or they are an absolute waste of time - students basically have to copy a chapter. I could go on like this forever. In a nutshell: buy this book if you have to, but sell it as soon as you can 
 I'm a huge fan of everything from Priest Driven Ambulance to date, I have all the albums and I've seen the band live.  In my honest opinion, Hit to Death just doesn't measure up to any of these other albums;  it was a step down from Priest and luckily their sound was refined and rescued by Satellite Heart a year later.  I know some of the die hard fans will disagree but I really think this album is not on par with the rest.  The Sun??  come on.  Gingerale Afternoon??  you can do better than that.  Some of this is recycled crap and regardless of how much you worship the Waynester and believe the band can do no wrong, this album is just plain boring in many spots.  I've tried to get into it for the last five years  but I just can't.  Exceptions of course are the terrific tracks Deathporn Blues, Hit Me, Felt Good, and Barbary Coast. Save your cash and buy Clouds Taste Metallic! 
 We visited about eleven cities in northern and central Italy and we carried both the Lonely Planet Italy and the Rough Guide Italy with us.  I had the Rough Guide Italy and had no problems looking up information.  My companion had the Lonely Planet Italy and she eventually gave up on it.  She found the LP to be lacking in basic information and basically a book better left at home.  We would recommend the Rough Guide instead 
 I bought this book as a quick reference for a Technical Support group I manage.  We have a few dozen products that require an installer to run wires throughout a house. Unfortunately, a large majority of the calls I get are wiring related and this book provides tremendous insight into the problems created by improper wiring.  If you want to learn about wiring, this is the book to buy.  I also bought the full book that goes with it.  It must be good because I got the only paperback, and all the used hardback books are almost double the retail price.   From this guide you'll learn everything relating to wiring.  You'll learn balanced vs unbalanced, ground loop isolation vs cross talk, and the list would almost be half as long as the pocket guide.  Simply put, if your livlihood depends upon wiring, this book will help you a great deal.  
  Combining a bad writing style with a penchant for self-righteousness, D'Souza comes across as the sort of guy who might serve as the ideologue for loony would be dictators.  This book is bad enough, but D'Souza would get progressively worse in both writing style and sense of logic.You might wonder how anything written worse than this could even be published. But then bad books are the stock-in-trade of the conservative press 
 Beware!  The "Product Features" for this product specified a "Call answer and end button on the headset." The device I received did not have that feature.  I selected this model because of the advertised feature.  Amazon.com's description was erroneous and misleading.  I returned the item and was charged for the return shipping.  I emailed them notifying them that it was their fault for falsely advertising a feature that was not part of the product. They ignored my email.  In the online return process, there's no option that states the return was a result of Amazon.com's fault.  Basically, they falsely advertise so that you buy the product, and when you discover it's not the right one you're screwed.  I now understand all those complaints I've read about Amazon.com.  I'll take the loss this time, but I won't repeat my mistake and order from them again.  Buyer beware!  This review is not so much about the product as it is about Amazon.com's false description of the product. I couldn't use the product so sorry I couldn't give a review about it 
 This book is very poorly written from a number of perspectives.    The timeline is atrocious. For example, you'll read about the death of Brian Epstein, then 50+ pages later he appears again in another section with no indication that the timeline has changed.  This jumping is very frequent, and appears all over the book.  Poorly organized.  Opinion is everywhere.  The author feels the need to inject his commentary on the Beatles' behaviors.  Of course, don't expect any analysis of WHY Lennon was so moody, or WHY McCartney was dominating, or why Starr and Harrison were resentful.  Don't even expect to get enough information to let you make some of your own conclusions either.  Another key failing in this book is the way it quickly glosses over key events leaving you wanting to know more - just one example is the whole period during which they recorded Revolver - the very title of the book!  Another example is when Ringo is quoted as not thinking Sgt Peppers was their best work.  Well, why not and what was Ringo's favorite?  Mr, Guiliano, you opened the door for us, so why not let us walk through?  On the other hand, there is FAR too much detail on their time with the Maharishi and the general workings of that organization.  Enough already!  I want to read about the Beatles, not some controversial religious figure!  There's also a lot of tawdry details on the love affairs, drug use/abuse, drug busts, and other seedy aspects of their career that are pure tabloid fluff.  Unforgivable beyond all others, there are obvious factual errors everywhere.  I've just finished reading Geoff Emerick's incredibly intriguing book and I can easily tell where Guiliano has either not done proper research or is simply inventing stories that will sound interesting.  There are several contradictions.  Overall, this is written like a collection of articles from People magazine (or whatever they had back then), with no real substance or depth to the content.  I'm sorry I spent the money on it 
 If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, "Eaters of the Dead" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel.  This was mostly a bore. Don't bother 
 This book's title leads one to believe it is something that it is not.  Designed for absolute beginners, it would indeed be a great tool for introducing a novice to the basics of horse care, management and handling. If, however, this is the type of information that you need, you are in no way a person who should consider, much less attempt to train a horse.  For those advanced enough to contemplate the training process, or perhaps looking for suggestions to refine your technique or to address a behavorial issue, this book is almost insulting, as it leans toward addressing subjects such as how to halter a horse and lead a horse, how to pick out hooves, etc - it is completely inappropriate 
   Creationists like Dembski would like to drag us back into the dark ages.  Back to times of the "inquision" when they burned the unfaithful and locked Galileo under house arrest for daring to challenge church athority with new views of the universe.  Galileo and Darwin were pioneers in modern science, not the end all.  The world is not flat and evolution is a fact.  Get used to it 
 This book was written for a University Professor, not a busy public school-teacher, with freshman-college-aged students, not little kids. If this is the author's idea of Elementary School Art, I can only imagine what her Secondary School book is like. Great book, just not keeping with the title 
 This was a "notorious rip off".  This was a misrepresentation of Lemony Snickets Series.  Amazon intentionally leaves out the fact that this is a blank notebook and is not the latest release in the series.  People who are waiting for the release are being duped into buying this worthless book with the expectations of receiving something else.  This is switch and bate and Amazon has stooped to it. Good way to loose customers pulling this kind of business!!! By the way, there should be a spot of 0 stars 
 I have re-read my 1984 edition of 'Men in Groups' and find it strange that this book has been published again in 2004 considering its errors and antiquated tone. I cannot imagine how the new introduction to the 2004 edition can get round these problems - for the author to take into consideration the knew knowledge about primates and human evolution and the actual changes in women's 'nature' in recent decades automatically renders the book obsolete.  Certainly, male bonding is a fact of human societies that needed to be recognized but we are now well past the false glorification of 'man-the-hunter' which pervades this book.  Tiger says his intention was that of abetting the feminist position by illustrating the depth and pervasiveness of the male conspiracy against women so it is somewhat amusing to find in his more recent wrtings that he is not as thrilled by the changes women have accomplished as we would expect.  The author could be forgiven in 1969 for ignorance regarding primates and human evolution. This ignorance led to his attempts to find the roots of human male bonding in hunting as he supposed that our ancestors were matrilocal, as most mammals are. Now we know our direct connection to chimpanzees we can see that they are patrilocal male kin groups with the females transfering to breed. Females are the outsiders - entering one group of male kin from another group of male kin that are their competitors and enemies. This is how it is, or has been, for human societies too. The odds were stacked in favor of male bonding and male self-interest and against that of females well before humans came along.  Tiger recognizes (at least he did in 1969) how male homosociality is detrimental to females and to humankind in general but he also feels compelled to sing its praises as if it has some magical quality beyond self-interest. He has the problem of wanting to find ways to feed and sustain the primitive and needy male homosociality while changing the outcome to something more civilized than we actually have. It is lke trying to cure an illness but refusing to accept the cause. There is a lot of male narcissism here along with a condesending attitude towards women that is hard to believe was so natural for men only 38 years ago.  Basically this book is obsolete. And, when all's said and done, why is it that if it is men driving human evolution, intelligence etc women always find themselves married to 'Homer Simpson'?? : 
 until Meltzer blithered out the most vitriolic, senseless, self effacing, guilt plagued indictment of white people Ive ever had the displeasure to get vertigo from. I threw the book straight into the trash after that. A bitter man, and a wasted talent who has done nothing of any worth whatsoever. Meltzer may have the rock game nailed dead, but I cant stomach an ex-rockwriter slandering 500 years of civilization wholesale just because he cant find a better place to live than LA, even if I am half his age. A dimbulb Dadaist flinging offal like a chimp at anything and anyone that gets more attention than he does. What a disappointment 
 it is full of mathmatical programing with no use. he makes you go in circles without giving you a real stuff.   
 I couldn't finish this book after readng "Fairytale."  Misfit insecure Caucasian male falls for Asian stripper/prostitute after she listens to him talk about the odor of his sweat in the outdoor markets.  I thought possibly this story reveals a lot about Olen Butler.  He wrote about this relationship with such relish, he sounds to me like a P.C. Caucasian who is drawn in patronizing fashion to the "otherness" of Asian people and doesn't see them for what they are, just wants them to appreciate big strong white man.  I thought it interesting that in the story the woman never mentions to the man that she already has a young son living with her mother.  So she was not honest with him.  But Olen Butler wrote about her as if this stripper/pros. was wonderful, the kind of wife any man would want.  I shook my head and thought, "You have issues."  Probably if she were Caucasian he would not want to get near her for fear of catching something.  After this the other stories just did not appeal to me 
 Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry 
 Would that the bard himself had directed.  Ian contorts and convolutes.  Judi despises and denies.  The whole stage to television adaptation loses the gripping starkness of the theatrical intent.  Brits being Brits bringing the bard to the modern masses. How more cliche can it get?  In 1976 this may have seemed the definitive version, and lord knows it made McKellen and Dench, but I still hold out hope against hope that an actor and actress will come forth and give this play the truly powerful pitch it deserves for the pallette of film 
 After reading Jane Austen, George Eliot, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Bronte, this book only tries, but never makes it to the 19th century period writing style. I disliked the fact that the author had to place us in this period, yet goes into the 21st century again and again with little nuances. What does a computer have to do with the people in 1867?  I do not understand how people could find a review helpful when the reviewer has given a book 5 stars. If you like the 19th century period, and is bothered by the way some contemporary novelist write, it is probably best to read the British authors of that time and forego John Fowles. I think Fowles tried to imitate George Eliot's Middlemarch by inserting certain quotes and passages from other books and Eliot's writing style, but Fowles has failed. This book comes out uninteresting and barely readable. It is amazing that a movie actually came out of this, and it is another wonder that people have actually liked this book enough to give it 5 stars.  I do have to add that if you are a woman, this book will definitely be offensive to you. The women are portrayed as manic depressive, innately hysterical, or terribly stupid and materialistic. Also, unless you are into 2 different versions of an ending, you would not like this book. Fowles may have thought that a reader would rather make up his/her mind on an ending, but I read a book because I want the author to give me a story. I do not want to have to make up my mind on how it should end. Otherwise, I might as well write my own book 
 I love Prince, but this is his weakest album to date. Prince actually played some AMAZING shows with Chaka Khan and Larry Graham in support of this album, and he also had complete artistic control making it; knowing this makes NEW POWER SOUL all the more disappointing. It sounds musically uninspired - a lot of Prince's trademark moves are here, the multi-track vocals, the nice licks, risque lyrics, etc. and the production is pretty smooth, but the final result sounds languid. In fact, compared to 1996's EMANCIPATION or 2001's RAINBOW CHILDREN (two better examples of his post-Warner Bros. work), NEW POWER SOUL sounds pretty boring.  "New Power Soul", "Mad Sex", and "Push It Up" have their moments, but they fizzle out quickly. The single "Come On" is the best upbeat tune/jam on this album, but after that first chorus, the funk doesn't hold up. There's some rudimentary bottleneck guitar to shake things up, but it comes off pretty weak. The other single, "The One," did better on the charts, but not enough to be called a 'hit,' not even a modest one; compared to "Adore" or MUSICOLOGY's "Call My Name," "The One" sounds really weak.  The one track worth your time is "Wasted Kisses." It's a hidden track - you have to skip past a whole bunch of blank tracks to track #49 to hear it - and it's a fine ballad. Easily the best thing here by a wide margin, if iTunes's online store ever sells it, I'd get it instead of buying the whole CD.  Luckily, a LOT of people seem to be selling this disc used for $1, so if you find a cheap copy, consider getting it for "Wasted Kisses," but don't pay much more for it. 
 Interesting how this book is by a professor of law and the book starts with chapter one laying down a guilt trip for thinking differently. Not too dissimilar to socially engineering a jury to take your side out of guilt during a courtroom opening statement perhaps.  Chapter 2 is really where all of the Darwinian Evolution objections are laid out. Which could roughly be summed up as..  1)DNA contains information, information can only come from  intelligence, so there must be a god/intelligent designer.  2)Meaningful information sequences + mindless repetition can not equate into meaningful information or enhancement of information.  3) He calls for examples of information increase or enhancement. (Can't seem to say decisively)  +1) Johnson works the 'information challenge' as if life was only information. What he fails to mention is that life is about having function that serves that life form. Function can come about randomly, and information and meaning are derived from that function. Life did not start with DNA and a huge set of information, it started with one self serving function that aided in the replication of a form(now life-form) over others.  Johnson makes numerous mentions of 'natural selection' and 'mutation' but makes no mention of the fact that 99% of our genome is junk and not information. Also without mention is 'cumulative selection'. Instead he manipulates an analogy Dawkins makes to hide from the power 'cumulative selection' has on turning useless bits of junk, in to a structure with function and derived meaningful information.  +2) This point is completely ignorant and shows that hes writing in a field he has little experience with. Information can be enhanced by 'mindless repetition governed by invariable laws'. For example, Delimiters. AMAZONBOOKS2000INTELLIGENTDESIGNJOHNSON or AMAZON,BOOKS,2000,INTELLIGENTDESIGN,JOHNSON          (This alphanumeric string is meaningless unless it can serve a function. Once the function is understood it can serve as something truely informative ie. information)               Mindlessly repetitive delimiters ',' contain no actual information, but enhances the information set by providing a function, fault tolerance.  +3)He calls for examples of information increase or enhancement,without being clear on which, and that there is a differance between increase and enhancement.  This call for evidence is shown to be increasingly pointless by his inablity to ask for what type of 'information increase' such as..   total information capacity, % of capacity used, or  true(compressed) % of capacity used. or to say genetically..  genome size, # of genes, or # of active genes                           --  The last part of the book is a feeble attempt at trying to now link this 'information design theory' directly to the Bible, which I surprising found to contain no argument for. Johnson must assume his negation of Darwinism leaves the Bible as the only logical alternative so why bother the reader with an argument he/she should feel guilty at disagreeing with (makes lots of references to Chapter 1 at this point, tap into that guilt!).  This book does however serve a good purpose, that of pointing out how scientific understanding can be manipulated and the weak points in the education of that scientific understanding.  A fine work of social engineering at the least.   mikes@signull.co 
 after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? give me a break! this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in 
 Certainly the subject material is interesting. It's the writer's style that is lacking.  It's like she is writing a thesis for university and has to increase the size of the paper and so she writes on and on.  It's overly scholarly and analytical when the reader just wants the story/history of these courtesans.  As others have said, I mostly skim-read it,  skimming over the paragraphs to try to pull out the tidbits of interest 
 There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked this book up on the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there 
 I got only half way through this book, so I am writing this review as a warning.  This book is awful on two accounts.  It is hastily written, and it isn't very informative. I would expect most readers to be either confused and/or bored, depending on their background (I cannot account for the other reviews).   Rose has several schematics of the brain, but does not actually explain them except in the most cursory way.  Rose emphasizes the interplay between genes and environment where environment must be interpreted in the broadest sense: for the unborn it includes not only the uterine environment but the signals from the other cells constituting the embryonic/fetal complex.  This is fine, but well accepted, at least amongst the scientists I have read.  Rose is impressed with Dimasio's work on consciousness, but he more refers to it than tries to make it clear, just as with his brain schematics.  He raises some interesting questions about evolutionary psychology, but he is so dismissal of the field, that the reader must seek elsewhere for an objective analysis.  Yes, I enjoy reading Richard Dawkins and even Steven Pinker, but I am not writing this review with an axe to grind 
 Nazareth is one of my favorites since 1975 when I heard "Hair of the Dog", their 5th album. But these "greatest hits" should've called "some greatest hits, some not at all" and I would slap the hands of people who composed this stuff... to not do that again. Only one third out of 18 songs deserves to be called "greatest", others are too far from that. It looks like  the compilation was assembled from whatever songs were available for the producer. This is a crappy approach which allows "novices" of Nazareth's fans to get easily disappointed. I have composed 3 (!) my own "greatest hits" CDs from Nazareth tunes... It seems the producers were not familiar with Nazareth's 30-year efforts at all. Only tunes 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 15 and maybe 18 may present Nazareth as one of the best groups in 70's thru 90's. Sad experience.. 
 This romantic comedy was charming, funny, and clever. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a problem with heavy British accents. (If you do, try it with captions). It was fun, funny, and a nice pick-me-up when one needs a lift 
 Oh yay; more on Germany compiled from the German hater.  Much to like here if you hate Germans.  As objective as anything from Moscow in the 50's 
 When I read Irving's "Son of the Circus" I thought that he would never write a better book. Sadly, I was right. "Widow for One Year" was a letdown, "The Fourth Hand" even worse. I began this book with some hope, but my hopes were quickly dashed. Irving's sense of the absurd has gotten out of hand, and "Until I Find You" is like reading a bad parody of his work. For one thing, virtually every part of his plot is simply implausible. The sex scenes between the children, however, was where this book got tossed into the trashcan. Irving apparently has no real sense of how children think of sex (which of course they do!) or how boys deal with girls. He has dedicated this junkheap of a book to his own young son, but when the boy finally is old enough to read it, I'm afraid he'll be as horrified as I. Beginning with "Garp" I devoured all his books. John Irving used to be one of those authors it was absolutely necessary to read, but now I'll never read another. This book was a waste of time and money and I resent every minute I lost reading it 
 I had hoped there would be some good ideas in this book. But dutifully reading along produced nothing more than page after page of "this is going to be good, and we're going to start, and it's really going to be good, and we're really going to start, and it's really really going to be good and we're really really going to start..." with pointless "examples" along the way.  Then I realized that if I'm really going to do something with my life, I don't need a book to tell me how. And certainly not this complete waste of time 
 This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed 
 The alternate title of this book should have been "HOW TO AFFECT AN AIR OF SOPHISTICATION AND URBANITY IN SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF PLODDING AND FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOTTING COUPLED WITH TWO DIMENSIONAL STEREOTYPES SO PREDICTABLE IN THEIR PRETENTIOUS MUSINGS".   An overly long title you might opine but surely not in light of the success of two such eloquent and verbose authors. I had hopes for these two having started with "Cabinet of Curiosities". Their subsequent offerings flagged sequentially but I retained hope for latent talent. Then this? This self-indulgent, conceited tome demonstrated a predisposition not unlike that so manifestly exhibited by the socially-upward-mobile.  I am so saddened to see that some of the most lauded exponents of modern popular fiction are the likes of Messrs. Preston and Child and perhaps the worst offender of all, Dan Brown 
 These are the sorts of books where you really have to find one on your level, and this was really shoots way, way below my level. Beyond making antiquated and sexist assumptions about the relationships between husbands and wives, the book is light on practical advice and heavy on sports metaphors low-brow yuk-yuk humor. I'm going to spend some time thumbing through this book's competitors before I buy another "guide for dads. 
 I got the dreaded "E18" error after owning this (naturally) for just over a year.  Repairs will be at least $100, and REPAIRS ARE ONLY GUARANTEED FOR 90 DAYS...even if the exact same problem occurs again!  This is clearly a design flaw (just read how many users had the same problem).  My first PhotoShot broke after about a year and a half, and since I liked the ease of use and basic design, I chalked it up to bad luck and bought another.  Big mistake 
 Obviously, the rantings of a depressed, selfish and self-righteous woman, who for if these issues were not enough of a challenge, believes in the fraudulent and assanine thinking of Freud. To bad she didn't kick the bucket before she had the opportunity to launch such a demented attack on the very core of society, and what brings meaning to life: family. This sad woman's physical appearance, almost confirms the above alone - just a miserable, frustrated witch.  
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 This coffee doesn't have anything special about it. I like good Kona coffee and I think 2 stars really tells it all 
 Purported knowledge not IN style anymore by the socalled academic elites.  Evolution, in the boxing ring got a KO by Professional scientists who UNderstand that KO means down.  Who LIVES for evolution other than those who live IN illusion.  Some day there will be enough people on EArTh to expose the lies of this ridiculous theory.  Until Then, Lies they will tell, and Exceptional lies they will be 
 That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating!  On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it 
 book is way too simplistic. good concept, but could have been written in one chapter 
 I love and admire sandy weill.i purchased this book to learn more about the man and his deal making prowess.although this book was well research,its presentation was what turned me off.i have never read a book so disjointed and dull.it doesnt follow the conventional chronological sequence that most biographies does but skips back and forth from one event to another i.e 60's-to-the-80's-to-the-70's-to 60's again...this goes on and on and on.this can be very very very frustrating.Also i dont think the authors did a good job in capturing the readers since the paragraphs come and go in that fasion throughout the entire book!  All who follow sandy weill's career knows his excellent ex-protege, jamie dimon.I would loved to learn more on Mr Dimon (curently President and COO of J.P Morgan Chase & Co) and i hope there will be a book on him in the future.  All in all, sandy weill is one hell of a guy who has done tremendous things in the financial sector.but if you really want to read a book which is more entertaining (or way better) than this book,then you should read "Tearing Down the Walls:How Sandy Weill fought his way to the top of the financial world...and then nearly lost it all" by Monica Langley.The book by monica langley is way way better and enjoyable.You'll also learn more about Jamie Dimon!!  In conclusion,dont buy this book but the one by Monica Langley.... 
 A neighbor gave me this book to read.  I have read the DaVinci Code and I thought it was good fiction mixed with some fact.  Of Course Dan Brown strings together many unrelated truths half truths and fabrications to make his story interesting, so it is quite easy to write an expose showing where he stepped over the line.  This critique of The DaVinci Code goes too far the other way trying to spin "Orthodox" Christianity as the only true religion and the "Orthodox" point of view the only "true" history of the last 2000 years.  The authors have dumbed down the subject matter, omitted information and scholarship contrary to their point of view, and created a book that borders on propaganda.  One part of the book that I found very annoying was the failure to address the historical excesses of institutional or "Orthodox" Christianity.  The Authors criticise Brown for writing that the Church (both Catholic and Protestant) Burned or otherwise murdered "Millions" of heretics.  The authors concede that the number is closer to 50 or 60 thousand.  So which is worse?  Making a mistake concerning the number of heretics murdered?  Or defending the institution that actually murdered thousands of people?  (And I would assume if we add in the Crusades both against the Muslims and the "heretics" we'd probably get a lot closer to the million than thousand figure.)  Another spin made by the authors actually caused me to laugh out loud.  You should read how these "Orthodox" scholars are spinning the female responsibility for the fall/oppression of females nexus.  Here's what they say.  The original sin in the Bible was Adam not working hard enough to spiritually protect his family.  This is a very "unorthodox" and "unbiblical spin designed to distract you from the fact that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have for centuries oppressed women because Eve ate the Fruit First.  What does Brother Paul say about it     11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.  12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp* authority over the man, but to be in silence*.  13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.  14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.  15 Notwithstanding she* shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety   I think Paul would be very angry reading the Author's attempt to put a "new age" spin the scripture to fit a more modern interpretation of the story.  This spin also flies in the face of Christian History.  And I do not feel any better about it even though the Authors point out that pagan cultures have abused women as well.  So what?  Do two wrongs make a right? If Orthodox Christianity is "true" why did it take the institution almost 2000 years to figure out that men and women were equal and figure out that the story in Genesis and Paul's exposition of it were wrong?   Ultimately this book fails because it is plain dishonest.  Yes it points out some issues where Dan Brown obviously inflates the truth, or even creates it out of nothing.  Brown's book has historical errors and it does have a point of view and an agenda.  However, this does not excuse the propaganda and misdirection contained in "Cracking Da Vinci's Code." 
 I finished it because a friend recommended it, but had she not, I would have quit after page 20. I wasn't interested in the story or writing. I didn't find the story grotesque; I've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book, but I just didn't find the protagonist very interesting. He went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation.  We learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs, to redeem himself. His actions didn't seem out of line, either during the war or during the plague, given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences.  I know this is a great example of a book written in second person, and perhaps for that it is worth reading.  I wouldn't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure 
 I grew up with this story - what happened?!  Somewhere in this grossly underproduced version they forgot that even in a kids story you need talented actors.  Kids know when someone sounds wooden and unskilled - and you can't pawn something as poorly done as this off on them.  They're smarter than that!  I could've done a better job in my garage.  "Under the bridge lived a troll..."  Come on 
 This book is very difficult to understand even with a basic background in finance and economics.  There is no structure, no clear definitions or definitions at all. I do not understand why the majority of instructors chose this text.  There even are errors in the solutions for the practice questions.  
  I dunno, I'm kind of skeptical about taking fatherly advice from a guy who thinks that incest is just a sign of a repressed society, and who's gone on record saying that date rape used to be just a good time. Hm, a good time for whom, one wonders?     Farrell likes to leave out certain facts. Like, for example, his complaints about how men die sooner and work more dangerous jobs. The former is proof of what, exactly?   The latter is disingenuous---men work more dangerous jobs from wihch women are excluded because these jobs tend to pay better. Then the danger is used as an excuse to keep women out of those jobs because the little ladies need protection, for which men of the Farrell type expect gratitude.  Farrell mentions at some point that almost no women died in the Viet Nam war. This is becuase women weren't allowed to FIGHT in the Viet Nam war at all.  And so forth and so on.      
 This is like a precurser to the Beat movement of the 1950's. The sentences are overly long, it's written like  a police report so you become overly aware that there is a narrator which takes much away from the telling of the story. The characters are not interesting and the story is boring 
 I give this one star only because the site won't let me give it zero.  After agonizing through the first hundred pages of this book just to see if it got any better (it didn't) I was so disgusted with his tiresome prose and graphic accounts of slave beatings that I literally threw the book in the trash.  Slavery was wrong, Mr. Davis, we get it, now get on with what we are to learn that we supposedly never did. My conscience got the best of me regarding tossing the book, though, since I have a certain reverence for books (even bad ones) so I fished it out of the trash and put it on the exchange table at work in case some masochist feels compelled to delve into it in its entirety.  I bought it at Goodwill for $1.50; I see why it got sent to Goodwill.  It's not one to keep in a collection.  In fact, if we were still using Sears & Roebuck catalogs in outhouses.... 
 They couldve written everything on one page, thne rest are just random helth facts.  Like all Bragg books 
 These disks would not work with my Sony brand DVD writer. I have tried several other brands and so far everything works but Memorex. 
 Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn't think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I kept falling asleep the first time. The script is very weak and thus so is the story, the  acting is flat. Most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from  existing documentaries (I have seen photographs of at least one scene), you  can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for  the movie are very poorly done. Don't waste your money, if you want to  watch it, rent it, don't buy it 
 I can see how instructors would be enthusiastic about this book, but unfortunately it will in no way help the student develop their ear training. Here's the problem. The book and CD basically outlines a METHOD of ear training, it is not ear training itself. For example, for each step of the book there is one and only one example on the CD. It is just that, an example, not a training. So, there is one 14 note "lesson" on intervals and from this you are supposed to magically learn how to identify all the major intervals. I don't think so. However, if you were an instructor then you could use that example as a starting point to develop your own lessons and work with students in recognizing intervals. You could spend a month on variations of that lesson itself since that's the core of ear training. In fact, if you're an instructor you can use the whole book as a blueprint for a year long curriculum from recognizing intervals to recognizing chords.   By the way, the CD itself mostly uses really dull organ patches. The idea may have been to eliminate timbre as a distraction. However, since one of the goals of ear training is to distinguish timbre from tone, this is another example of how this book/CD in itself won't be of much use to students. 
 This is a crummy compilation of a great band.  The 1977 'Greatest Hits' is better.  Unfortunately, it is out of print.  The most glaring omission is 'The Thrill of it All.'  In all, five songs are missing in action.  A great  Roxy Music collection should include, Manifesto, Avalon and the earliest  Greatest Hits 
 I was surprised when I took this class that I did not like this book.  All of my epid profs highly recommended this text.  You have to flip back and forth when you are doing the problems because they list the SAS output that you need once in one chapter.  I know it saves space, but this can get maddening.  I did not find the examples clearly written at all-the lack of fit test, and some of the stuff about partial F tests could have used a few more sentences.    No, I cannot write a glowing review of the text, but the only reason for the second star is because I also had a terrible instructor for this course.  Perhaps if Dr. Kleinbaum had taught this to me, I would have a different perspective of this book.  However, I was pretty much teaching myself this material, and this book is not designed for that. 
 The book Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White to me is blatant and apparent proof that the Asian political voice has been hijacked and is fully rampant with an anti-white, anti-American viewpoint.  While I do not think the mind of Mr. Wu is reflective of the vast majority of Asians in America, his scripture is about as proof-positive as I have seen that while white Americans (European Americans) have fought hard against segregation for decades under a naïve spell for the benefit of minorities, Asian politicians as well as university professors of various minority races are actually promoting the philosophy and indoctrination for racial separatism.  The idea of racial equality is apparently not what elites like Frank Wu have in mind:  the condemnation of America and the same people who created pro-Asian immigration laws from the middle 1960s - whites -- is.  Far beyond equal rights for all, this new anti-anything-for-the-sake-of-it viewpoint, which airs in Yellow is nothing like what Martin Luther King, Jr., and the many other former civil rights activists were promoting.  The mindset of the author in this book (Frank Wu) is hyper-eccentric, seemingly hateful, dangerously irrational, and anti-establishment with no clear objective other than dissent for destruction.  To learn about the new form of hatred that a growing radical Asian intellectual base and other minorities are brewing, browse this book 
 Please remember that this is a Frontline episode, not a work from A&E, the History Channel, or most of PBS.  Thus, it ran like a news show, rather than a proper documentary.  This work shows meth addicts at the beginning briefly, then it goes into how the DEA is trying to prevent its production and how drug traffickers find loopholes in the strategy.  If you want to hear more, you won't.  Oprah's episode on meth was much different than this.  Fred Durst sang, "Keep rollin', rollin', rollin'!" and Lady Miss Kier of Deee-Lite sang, "Keep the host spinnin'!  Keep the host spinnin'!"  Gay activists have been trying to curb meth abuse in the gay community.  However, none of this comes up for Nightline.  Nightline just gives you one perspective on this multi-faceted concern 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 This so-called Guide To Charm is not guiding at all. I personally do not feel more charming after reading it, and have furthermore...no clue as to how I can improve my charming skills and yet...I thought that was what the book was about. Believe me, you do not need this book. The authors keep saying they would give you advice on such and such and then apologize and mention it's really not the point of such a small book. In one word: unuseful. There is no hint, no advice, not a thing I did not know by common-sense. Don't Waste your money on this book. There are such good ones on this matter but this very one 
 I have a 4 year degree in Computer Science and have been building and repairing PCs for over 10 years.  I found this book to be worse than useless.  It's clear that the author (who's degree is in buisness) really doesn't understand much of what he is trying to explain. The book is riddled with gross errors, missinformation and managed to directly contradict inself dozen of times.  Furthermore it reads as if 80% of the matterial was written between 1994-1998.   Examples Page 62 explains that high memory is the last 64k of the first 1 MB og memory and has a table showing the upper memory area ending at 320k. Page 137 explains that it is the first 64k of the 2nd MB of memory, and has a table showing the upper memory aea ending at 384k.    The book repeatedly states that EDO is the most popular memory type and that SRAM cache modules are found in most motherboards.    Or how about on page 23 where he claims that the largest number that can be stored by a n bit binary number is 2^(n-1).  When it is really (2^n)-1.  The examples he gives makes it clear that this is not a typo, he really doesn't understand binary numbers!    I would feel guilty selling this book used.  Its going straight into the trash 
 Nice Looking, but not easy to move.  The bar at the top isn't smooth and it hurts if you try to move the stool with one hand.  Also, it arrived with the top plastic piece broken on one side.  Disappointed.  Not worth the trouble of returning

 This "book" is probably the worst written I've ever encountered. It was so flawed as to be considered literature. Alice Walker tries to "One-up" Harriet Beecher Stowe, in writing about brutality. Titles like these are weapons used in the Anti-Black Male agenda this society has long perpetuated. All the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. The women are portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell.   The only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women. I've learned long ago, when absolutes such as these are presented, a greater agenda is at work. There are no "real" men in this book! Only distorted caricatures of Black masculinity. I only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst. I find this title as dangerous as Hitler's "Mien Kampf", in it's portrayal of Black men as evil and morally destitute.   Presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible. True, there are criminally abusive men in every culture. But there are also forthright, upstanding  men as well. To present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity, only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about.   Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional "Uncle Tom's Cabin", sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war. This title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of Black Men.   This book is fiction. However,it is not presented as such. I'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents. I have no qualm about outrage at such abominations. However, I do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations. That is what I find so unbelievable and offensive about this book.   In my opinion, this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it. I don't find it a testament to the strength of Black Women at all. I interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further distortion of African-American culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the Black Male as being hopelessly inhuman.  I'm sure Alice walker made a lot of money with this book. Feminist, racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature. I wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades, were it a fictional depiction of White American Men brutalizing White Women. Most definitely not!!! I doubt it would have even found a publisher. America is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of Black Men and African-American culture.  My life as a Black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion. Whatever Ms. Walker's motivations were in writing this novel, I'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted.   This is racist, misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature!        
 As a debut, this novel is noteworthy, and the author paints a highly visual picture of the Africa she knows.  To me, the disappointment with the novel was the author's inability to go deeper.  It stayed very "surface level" with me, reads almost like a "young adult" novel.  Also deals with the subject of physical abuse, so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it.  
 Feldman and Spratt advise lots of CEOs of large corporations as part of their work for PricewaterhouseCoopers (a mergerized mouthful if there ever was one), and those consulting habits show. The book is anecdotal and clever without being practical or useful, even if you're actually contemplating a merger. You will, however, learn the riddle of the five frogs on a log, which in the interest of saving time, we offer here: Five frogs are sitting on a log. Four decide to jump off. How many are left? Five. Because there's a difference between deciding and doing. "Execution," the authors tell us, "is always more difficult than it seems."  Here's the lesson: Smart advice is timeless. If you do want a quick take on making effective decisions, then consider the very short chapter "The Effective Decision" in Peter Drucker's Managing the Non-profit Corporation (HarperCollins, 1990). Drucker writes sharply about the evils of reaching consensus too quickly, the dangers of not doing your homework, and the fact that decision making always involves risk taking. He also observes that "far too many decisions remain pious intentions." Even more memorable than the frog story.  
 there are much better prints of these good movies out there than this poor looking disc!!! 
 In the first 7 books, there was the same reader, now, with the mark, there is a new reader,  which is always a pain in the butt.  This new author also tried to imitate the accents of each person.  Not fun to listen to.  Add to this my opinion these books are nothing but poorly constructed religious porn 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 As far as I can there no CIW books that are much newer than 3 years old. Also, there are no books for the IDO-510. My guess is that after internet bubble burst, the demand for CIWs burst along with it 
 I first read about Jack Parsons in the L.A. Times and it got me intrigued.  When I bought the book I thought it was going to be filled with nothing but his eccentricities and that's wanted I wanted to read.  But it got real technical.  Pages of his U.S patents which I did not find interesting.  The author did his homework as far as the smallest details of Parson's life.  Going so far as to tell you where Parsons lived (and dates of residency) and he moved quite a bit.  I did enjoy reading about the relationship he had with Alister Crowley and L. Ron Hubbard which portrays him (Hubbard) as a con man he is.  Basically, it's a technical book that I feel didn't quite hit the mark.  
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 Although Willingham is a good story teller, it's clear that he hasn't been in the business of PROVIDING customer service since the 70's.  Back then the customer was always right and businesses had time to make the customer happy.  Today customers are more demanding and unreasonable.  Time truly is money and it's getting harder and harder to go the exra mile when it means letting something else slide.  Yet no one can afford to lose customers.  The principles in the book are good:  giving the customer your full attention, listening to them, making eye contact, inviting them back and so on.  But there's nothing new here, and it needs to be updated for 2003.  Come on Ron, get with the times and give us something we can use.  Points for the quaint stories, though 
 Somewhere in Turkey, there is a forest where you may be attacked by man-eating flying monsters living in the dormant volcano nearby. To this place come one American professor who needs to publish a paper, one graduate student as assistant (and love interest), and four naïve undergraduates who just want to get their degree from college. Deep in this forest, moreover, a group of terrorists are hiding, and the US special force is sent to capture their leader in order to bring back him alive. (But do American college students need to fly all the way to Turkey to graduate? Travel financed by one of the rich student's daddy?)  Part of this impossible scenario sounds like that of `Predator,' but in this film it is the titular dinosaur `Pterodactyl' - no, in fact, pterodactyls, to be precise - that attack the hapless special unit. Unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger classic, however, the creatures in `Pterodactyl' only bore you to death because of their cheesy CGI and dull and uninspired action scenes that always begin when there is nothing to talk about in the story. The film is not scary, nor exciting even with occasional gore, and when the flying pterodactyls look like big bats that you might see on video games, what can you expect from the rest of the film's 90 minutes?  Coolio is the captain of the special unit, and his acting itself is not bad. But at the same time, I am afraid, not many people would find the idea of Coolio vs. predacious monsters intriguing, and the results are exactly what you expect from the ill-judged combination. The other actors are not great either, but with this bad story and dialogues, and most of all very unconvincing creatures, none one can be blamed.  The saddest thing is that the director is Mark L. Lester, who once did the underrated action film `Commando' back in 1985 with Schwarzenegger. That was a ridiculous story, but I really liked the way Schwarzenegger's hero talked and behaved (throwing a telephone booth!). It was silly, but it was fun. `Pterodactyl' is silly, and tries to be fun, which you know it is not 
 I like these guys alot.I own a bunch of there stuff and love to see them live. I played this Cd a few times liked it at first, but it didn't grow on me at all liked I'd hoped.To cute for me,not spontaneous enough.I feel this cd will be just another dust collector in a short period of time.Just let it rip guys,that's what you do best.Thank god my brother bought this instead of me.I bought live at cow palace (The Dead) great Cd 
 First of all, I would like to start off by saying that this movie sucks.  Here are a few of the things that supports my decision. 1. Dacascos does not know Capoeira. He played the berimbau (an insrument used in Capoeira) wrong, he pronouced many of the terms incorrectly, and he had no flow to his movements.  2. The acting was horrible.  While watching this, you kind of get the picture that the director wanted to finish this movie a soon as possible.  Most of the lines were just stupid.  Dacascos character had no real history.  apparently had this mysterious past you really could care less about because the plot was so predictable. 3. The fighting was laughable at best.  Capoeira is the only martial art that was outlawed for being so violent and unstoppable.  You don't need corny fight scenes to show it's usefulness.  Most of the fight scenes where repeated movements that were shot at different angles.  Dacascos was doing meia lua's (a spinning kick in which both hands are on the ground as you strike) that were knocking out three people at once.  In one ridiculous scene, Saverio (the drug lord) pointed to where he wanted Dacascos to stand so that he could miraculously appear behind him and perform and unchallenged jumping kick to the back of his head.  I wish an experinced Capoeirista would have done the fight scenes.  Although this movie was horrible, it is the only movie in which Capoeira is suppose to be the main artform used. While watching this movie, one can only hope that this poor performance dosen't hurt Capoeira's chances at being the cornerstone of another movie.  
 I don't know if Wigmore's book has merit because I will probably never buy it.  Of the eleven glowing reviews, two were written by awi 12, and four (4) by a Dr.(self styled?)Craig.  This makes suspect all eleven.  Amazon has fallen down on the job by not monitoring the reviews, and leaves me in the position of a doubting Thomas with all future reviews.  Ironically, the one person hurt by Craig and others is the author 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 surprisingly good movie - ted wass has general goofiness with his role.  while I was really wanting NO MORE PANTHER MOVIES from BLAKE(THERAKEINTHEMONEYCASHCOW)EDWARDS.  I certainly think this movie stands on its own with subtle charm.  plot: ted's character in search of clouseau-.  its nice to see some inventive clips used in this film but in the end a thinly disguised movie is often a terrible movie. - if you are a PP FAN you will want to get this to add to your collection - be aware that its basically a BAREBONES edition, nothing is really there for you and MGM(Money,Grubbing,Moguls)-should be ashamed not to have tried a little harder.  HOWEVER:  the price is nice and most if not all of the recent reissues are less than 10bucks-found anywhere.  performances: ted wass has genuine comedic flair.  sadness: is that DAVID NIVEN who was terminally ill and died shortly after this movie--his voice was done by RICH LITTLE and at the end of the movie---ROGER MOORE's imitation of PETER SELLER character has charm with a snicker.  one of the things that makes the PP MOVIES so entertaining-yes, PETER SELLERS but for me HERBERT LOM is a scream and the more pain inflicted on him the more my stomach hurts from laughing too hard.  fans or casual interested, should check out other movies SON OF PINK PANTHER and INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU--certainly not the best movies SPP with ROBERTO BENIGNI and IC with a performance by ALAR ARKIN-are suprisingly entertaining in their own right.--also, all of the other PINK PANTHER films--let's hope STEVE MARTIN's movie THE PINK PANTHER adds to the spirit of the man who originated it---PETER SELLERS thanks for the memories!!!! 
 If your looking for an autobiography of someones life then this is the book for you.  But if your buying the book to learn the darvas system of the stock market then this is not the book for you.  I gave this book a 1 star rating because the book jacket said that the book contained information about nicolas darvas' system for profiting in the market.  But nowhere in this book does he give you any information about it or how to use it. It sounds like all he did was buy a stock that was in a strong uptrend and then bought it when it passed the resistance level.  Nicholas also gained most of his money when he bought a cheap stock on a wim for maybe 5 or 10 dollars and it shot up in price overnight and was restricted for anymore trading.  He ended up selling for 171 dollars a share and sold for a profit of 250,000.  His idea of buying resistance is nothing new and it sounds like he was lucky more than anything else.

 Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get "done in" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one 
 This is the kind of art that show me the power of fiction over reality. Why did he use those sizes? Wow! Did you see them? I do have fantasies but come on! Let's get real. Real guys with real dimensions. No more no less,  that's the beauty of life 
 I recommend NOT to purchase this item.  Look for another one. The lens itself seems ok, although I can't really say, but the adapter which is built in to the lens is shoddy and cumbersome and ruins the the whole deal.  The adapter is a quick release type where one end attaches to the camera and the lens simply snaps in, or is quickly released.  This would be great, except for two very important things.  One, the lens fits very loosely in the quick release adapter. This causes some MAJOR distortion, especially when moving.  Two, the housing is made of thin plastic which does not seem very durable.  In fact it is so cheaply thin that I am afraid to leave it in my car because the heat may distort the plastic. One drop, even a small one, and it is done for 
 Martha Grimes has had a good thing going with the Richard Jury series, until now.  Bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book.  More like muddled, drawn out, and difficult.  The story within a story is an intriguing idea, but it went nowhere.  The plot is weak, the characters' actions unbelievable, and the ending disappointing.  I have enjoyed reading this series, but to be honest, this book was a waste of time.  I think it's time for Jury, Plant, and pals to be put to rest.   
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 Don't hesitate a moment before purchasing the classic "Girls, Girls, Girls!" Elvis, the King of Kings---the grand, high, exhalted, mystic ruler of all of Heaven and Earth, is superb. If only Laurence Olivier had his stage presence! If only Richard Burton had his voice! If only Clifton Webb had his acerbic wit! Yes, Elvis Presley was a thespian for the ages. The greatest actor who ever lived! Oh, how he filled the screen---especially in his latter years. In particular, his performance in the deeply touching, highly philosophical film "Girls, Girls, Girls" is one to be cherished by film and theatre aficionados of all ages, creeds, and cultures. What style! What grace! What announciation and articulation! Indeed, Elvis is every bit the equal of John Barrymore, Richard Mansfield, and John Gielgud in their prime. The only one of Elvis's sophisticated, allegorical performances that might possibly equal this remarkable spewing of dialogue is his masterful characterization in "Tickle Me!" Was the stage play for this literary masterpiece ever performed at the Old Vic? Of course, truth be told, Elvis was a phenomenal actor in every one of his matchless films---and to think that a guitar popped up in each one no matter what the setting or plot! Truly a miraculous performer. The man should have won at least a dozen Academy Awards as Best Actor. Who could ever forget the King uttering such romantic, poetic, tender phrases like "Uh, huh." No wonder all the women here at the Skunk Creek Geriatric Center find him so irresistable! I bow to his genius. A greater singer than Caruso! A greater actor than Olivier! A greater dancer than Astaire! I gotta go now...the guys in the white coats have gotten hold of me and are transporting me back to Happydale Sanitarium. Viva Elvis! My king! My hero! My God 
 I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen.  As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story.  It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing.  The story's decent.  The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go?  Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe?  It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one.  A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work 
 Thank goodness I checked this book out from the library before buying it!  I flipped through the whole 250-page book in literally 15 minutes.  There is a ton of print in teeny tiny font.  Personally, I don't care that much for what Colin Cowie has to say, I am more interested in the pictures that he gathers to give a visual image of a wedding.  I didn't read any of it because it was so small and there seemed to be so much that I can only imagine how much useless filler was in there.  The pictures, what I actually care about, were of poor quality.  The book was published in 1998 but many of the weddings screamed 1980s.  The pictures were small, with poor lighting and lacked a glossy, professional finish.    I don't know if the point of the book was to show a ton of different wedding styles and to give everyone ideas no matter what your wedding will be - but that's not the point I got.  The headings of the weddings were things like "Formal garden party", "Informal party under a tent", but they all looked exactly the same.  The decorations, dresses and menus all seemd very old-fashioned with gilded angles, poofy sleeves and roses galore.  There were more roses in this book than I think I have seen in my entire life.  And for a girl whose wedding will have hydrangeas (which were shown once or twice as a filler with roses), it wasn't particularly helpful.  In a nutshell, I thought this was an uninspired book with poor quality pictures and too much verbiage.  I didn't see a single thing that I even stopped to think, "Hm, would I want that in my wedding?", I just blew past everything because nothing was appealing 
 This movie had a lot of potential.  I did not even mind the changes in the movie from the stage production.  BUT, any one with any singing experience knows that it is IMPOSSIBLE to sings these songs without opening your mouth!  The leads are all running around singing intense songs with their mouths open a crack.  I could not enjoy this movie at all because I knew they were lip syncing.  If something like this bothers you, I would avoid this movie.  The acting definitely falls flat. 
 I can see by the abundance of good reviews that the formula of using template beats is alive and well.  Any one of us could have made this album.  Just go to a neighborhood teenager with a drum machine pay him $100 to purchase 11 minutely variant beats and you have this album.   This album has absolutely no originality.  We have heard this album many times before and I'm sure we will hear it many times in the future.  I give it two stars for the fact that it does make for adequate generic r&b background music for a lite dinner party 
 I think I've seen almost everything Bob's been involved with and this just didn't do it for me. If you have friends and they aren't complete dullards, you've probably had most of the conversations you'll see in this movie 
 "Rip It Off" is not an easy film to watch. In short, it is dull and meanders from plot line to plot line, leaving only the most attentive viewer (read: myself) to guess at what was going to happen next. But not in a good way. Judging from its drab look and unimaginatively shot scenes, not to mention a script whose dialogue borders on the absurd, it never ceases to amaze me how it managed to attract such well-known and talented personalities as Alyson Hannigan and Jennifer Esposito. It begs the question: WHY DID YOU DO THIS FILM? Or, on a personal note, why did I BUY this film, especially at $22 and change? Frankly, I bought it because of Alyson Hannigan: she's gorgeous, obviously intelligent, and the girl can act. Individually speaking, she does not disappoint here. It's obvious that she really didn't want to sleep walk through her role as Lexi, and she gives the other actors a lot of material to work with. Although the silly musical leitmotifs seem deliberately crafted to undermine her scenes, she is a singularly interesting actor to watch, and her performance simply wants me to see her do more, preferably a more mature and fully fleshed out character in a serious film (see Jennifer Aniston in her brave performance in "The Good Girl.")But enough gushing: if Ms. Hannigan had not been as engaged, I would have trashed her soundly. Most everyone else in "Rip It Off" (with the possible exception of the fellow who plays Sergei with operatic relish) is more or less "phoning it in" when they do their scenes. This made me lack any kind of sympathy for them in addition to making me sleepy. Also, films of such low production value should come with a printed warning of some sort: BEWARE! DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SCREEN; THE APPEARANCE OF THE FILM IS INHERENTLY BAD. "Rip It Off" and films of its ilk give independent filmmaking a black eye. I've seen black and white student films with greater intrigue and atmosphere than this turkey. And, contrary to the technical description of the DVD, IT IS PRESENTED IN THE HORROR THAT IS FULL SCREEN, AND NOT WIDESCREEN. Can you believe people invest money in these films? (Ahem. 
 Come on people! Even Jack Vance's zany Dying Earth novels (Cugel in particular) have more substance than this lackadaisical tour-de-force. Skip out on Burroughs, if you want quality sci-fi read the Demon Princes by Jack Vance.. 
 The other day I have picked up the latest book by our first Turkish Nobel Laureate in literature, Orhan Pamuk. As far as one could tell, the decision to honor him with the Nobel Prize was largely based on this particular literary accomplishment. At least, when asked by reporters why Pamuk deserved the Prize, Professor Horace Engdahl, the very multilingual Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, kept referring to this book.  The book in question, Istanbul: Memoirs and the City, is a concoction of encyclopedic information, nostalgia-invoking monochrome photographs and the author's unsettling childhood memories. It could very well be crowned his worst work to date by readers familiar with the author's previous books. As I forced myself through page after page of what seems to be Pamuk's much distorted perception of his hometown, I can honestly say that his childhood memories sprinkled here and there were what kept me awake.  Just like in his previous works, a constant undertone of pessimism and hopelessness is palpable throughout the book, but his negativism is more disconcerting this time around as he unsuccessfully tries to ascribe his internal conflicts and his personal darkness to a magnificent town whose wonders never cease to amaze.   Owing to his affluent background and is uber-privileged vantage point, Pamuk's views are so dreadfully skewed that you might start believing him while he wholeheartedly describes the citizens of his version of Istanbul, hovering in a dream-like state of communal melancholy.  His imaginary Istanbul - with its decrepit buildings, filthy streets and rabid dogs roaming its dark, narrow, and decaying alleys - is not the vibrant city throbbing with liveliness that the ordinary folks, like his readers or the lower class Istanbullus for that matter, are able to perceive. His repeated use of the adjective dilapidated to describe certain aspects of Istanbul feels deliberate and malevolent.  As he paints this almost repulsive picture of Istanbul, he does not fail to rebut disagreeing views of European Istanbul lovers by telling them, "You need to live here at least ten years to be able to see it through my eyes."   Who are you to know what you are seeing?  Pamuk sees Istanbul as a fallen fantasy town where he is entitled to scorn poverty and the impoverished which uglifies what is rightfully his. He is visibly and unashamedly tormented as this city, for which he fosters a pathological affection, ignores his irrational expectations of conformity altogether. She continues to pulsate, breathe and change, remains jovial and full of energy, determined to enjoy whatever life throws at her as Pamuk watches from the sidelines in anguish.  Most disturbing of it all is his suggestion, maybe not directly but most certainly inferentially, that Istanbullus have no fight left in them. They have already lost the game and have made peace with the fact - hence comes the hï¿½zï¿½n a term he is trying a little too hard to coin - and are desperately waiting for the shoe to drop. (Hey, why not generalize this to the entire country while we are at it and reinforce the whole Sick-Man-of-Europe deal?) Pamuk's yearning for all things European and his dislike for whatever may represent the east is even more pronounced in parts of the book where he professes his love to Istanbul.  It is fair to say that Pamuk's work brought him very little acclaim in Turkish literature, and few if no awards. His writing skills have always been an issue of debate among his colleagues. Nowadays, there is a lot of discussion in Turkey about how his literary inelegance is magically lost in translation, how his sentences are invigorated and become more passable with some creative interpretation from his talented translator Melling Freely, as well as many proven accusations of plagiarism.  Until recently, Pamuk has been known to steer clear of politics. He has spent most of his career carefully avoiding political subjects, or approaching them only tangentially, with the calculated caution and slickness expected from bourgeoisie intelligentsia.   His abrupt and seemingly unnatural politicization began with Snow, his most politically-charged novel to date. His loving embrace of "all things political", unforeseeable as it was, tightened up faster than expected, reaching its peak with his astounding public statements regarding the killing of one-and-a-half million Armenians and thirty-thousand Kurds. This incarnation of Pamuk even claimed that he was the only person in Turkey who had enough cojones to broach these sensitive issues. Why the sudden change, you might ask yourself. I did ask myself, for one thing, why did the vanilla boy become interested in politics in his fifties?   All the publicity and buzz surrounding this "new and improved" Pamuk must have sounded like music to Pamuk's mostly English speaking allies and co-workers, who have done more than their share of P.R. for Pamuk's continued existence in European and American literary circles. These selfless allies have gone so far out of their way to promote this one specific author in such unprecedented fashion that it makes one wonder why.  Measly commissions they were to get from the marketing of Pamuk's books were so out of proportion with the amount of effort they put into hyping Pamuk to literary stratosphere that you have to ask why?  Did the promoters of Pamuk have an ulterior motive? Was the French Parliament's passing of the bill that criminalizes "questioning of armenian genocide" just when Pamuk's received his award a coincidence? Is European Union, which harbors this primordial mentality that does not stop at telling you what you can or cannot say but goes a step further and dictates what you can and cannot question, worth joining? Did people around Pamuk lure him into doing things that he might not have done otherwise by using the brilliant Nobel Prize as bait?  Was it worth it?  Reportedly, Pamuk's editor at Random House, George Andreou said in an interview in 2001, that if Pamuk were to write more politically he would have won a Nobel Prize by then.   This statement answered at least some of my questions 
 I love Gene Kelly but I don't love this book. I don't see the point in the AFI tribute, just get to the history. The only good thing I can say about this book is that Gene Kelly's talent and determination come through, but that is nothing the author did, that was Gene Kelly and you can get that from any book, any movie, and any story told about him. 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 I bought the goggles and was excited by the look. They are kind of "Riddick" like. They had disappoiinting performance when I rode my jet ski at 65 mph and they flew off my face. They did float and so I found them and tried it a second time and same thing happened. I gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing. They definately are not for extreme sports. They are also too big for casual use as sun glasses.  
 This book is so bad. The first two chapters are good,But each page gets worse and worse after that. The only reason i finished the book was because i was waiting for it to get better. I live in new york. This book has nothing to do with new york in any way. When i first saw the books cover i thought.. this should be a good book. Boy was i wrong. 
 Mr. Bloxham does not take into account the effects of the Armenian Revolt, which lasted from the 1890s to 1920. Armenian revolutionary groups, the Hinchaks and Dashnaks, launched a campaign of terror against Ottoman officials and citizens. They began killing Muslims 20 years before the Armenian deportations took place in 1915. Also, from 1915 to 1920, Armenian soldiers, rebels and gangs massacred a half-million Turks, Kurds and Azeris. If we are willing to call what happened to the Armenians a genocide, then what do we call what the Armenians did to the Muslims?   Anyone who seeks to learn about the Armenian/Ottoman tragedy should start with a book published in 1964 by the Armenian scholar, Louise Nalbandian: "Armenian Revolutionary Movements." She wrote her book shortly before the Armenian Diaspora began to politicize their claims to genocide. It doesn't matter to me whether a person believes the Armenians were victims of genocide in 1915. What matters to me is that "academics" such as Mr. Bloxham insist on discussing only one side of this tragic story, and continue to pretend that Armenians did no wrong.  Horrible atrocities were committed on all sides; it is the responsibility of Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan to deal with this legacy. In the U.S. and Europe, this issue has become too politicized. Anyone who disagrees with the Armenian viewpoint is automatically labeled a "genocide denier." Unfortunately, most of the media and politicians have naively chosen to support the Armenian genocide claims without conducting their own research. And they choose to believe that "scholars" such as Mr. Bloxham are basing their writings on thorough research that takes the Armenian revolutionary movement into account; such is not the case 
 Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award.  Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19.  Lauded by the literary types as exemplifying Austen's wit and irony, it's really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums 
 This was truly a let down. I know after so many years it's hard to keep a strip fresh. But Jim Davis shouldn't let Garfield get so watered down. I've loved Garfield since I was a kid, and own all the books (Number 14 being my favorite), and all the other books Davis has released. I could pick up this book, and go through it without finding a joke that was new, or funny, which of course is a huge let down. Garfield is not Snoopy, where Charles Schultz made the Peanuts Gang interesting and funny as long as he wrote it. After reading this, you get the feeling that Jim Davis was out of new material 10 years ago, and he's just trying to milk the series for all it's worth. Cats don't usually live well into their 30's, so I believe it's time for Davis to start thinking of how to let Garfield ride into the sunset with a scred of dignity left. If you must purchase this book, stop in your local bookstore and leaf through it, to see if you still like it. I love Garfield as much as the next person, but not this way 
 In Stephen  Silbiger's words, "I realised that the basics of an MBA education were quite simple and could easily be understood by a wider audience." What the author is trying to do with his book is to cram in two years of an MBA education into 350 pages. Naturally, the book misses the whole point of the exercise of a University education: it takes time to grasp the often complex models that students will have to master in order to be eligible for a diploma with their name on it. It may be true that a lot of MBA programmes are very repetitive and that the basic information can indeed be summarised into a few pages only, however this means that all the details is missing.  As we all know, MBA programmes are very heterogeneous and will all differentiate at teaching something slightly different, in as far as the subjects are concerned (obviously the contents remains the same for the same subjects). Silbiger's MBA is based upon 9 subjects, where others like negotiation, international business, entrepreneurship, or project management are all summarised into one chapter.   What this book does well, is to emphasise that the main objective of an MBA is to be able to take a global decision within an organisation, that is decide in such a way that no aspect of your entrerprise will be defavoured in any way. However, not only does the book lack in perspective (the author literally bases his this book on his personal educational experience and does not focus at all beyond the US border), but at the same time the contents of this book is very shallow. The great theories are only outlined in very general terms and a lot of detail and further theories that you should expect from a sound MBA, are missing totally. The book is an insult for all those who have actually completed an MBA, by spending one or two years at a constitutional MBA, and puts the non-MBA reader at a very low level.  Thus only the lowest rating can be awarded for this book, as it fails to deliver what it promises 
 Have you ever met a person where every single thing that happens to them is a spiritual awakening?  The kind of person that can't go to the bathroom without making some sort of journal entry of the new vistas they discovered?  Well that is the kind of mentality you get with this book.  You can't simply look at a sunset and be in awe of nature or God.  No you need to relate to it and make it a part of you.  I am avery spiritual person and love traveling.  I have traveled all over the world and feel complete when I do so.  Reading this book did the one thing I never thought was possible, it put me off of traveling.    Fortunately, the feeling passed quickly.  I will not make little travel shrines.  I will not take little spiritual trips across my living room.  I will not follow this persons advice.  And this book is going nowhere near my rucksack.  Sorry, I am too stoic for this book.  I would recommend people read books about the places they want to go.  Learn their culture and a little bit of their language.  Don't worry about the trip just go on it.  My passport is the only material possession I truly value. 
 I love Vincent Price and have many of his movies but this one I wish I had not bought. It is really stupid. It was one of his later movies that he probably made just to have work  
 Compared to the other books I received in this order, this one was very small with yellowed pulp type pages. The book's content may still be fine but the book itself looks very dated 
 It goes without saying that this man is a pioneer of his craft, however there are throngs of contemporary chefs who are doing things with food that show that they know their ingredients better than Peterson does- good cooking is a result of knowing your ingredients and knowing them well. Peterson claims that there is little, if any, difference between Wild, farm-raised, and Atlantic salmon. This is preposterous! The difference is oceanic. Perhaps Peterson has never eaten Wild King Alaskan salmon or Copper River Sockeye salmon or anything from the Yukon River, which is a real pity, because one of our lifetime's greatest foodies is missing out on the greatest culinary experience of all time! Save you money and spend it on Peterson's Fish & Shellfish. Even the salmon recipes are better 
 Great coffee, and a convenient size, but the carafes keep breaking on me! I used the original carafe just a few times before it broke. I ordered a replacement, and was extra careful when handling it (especially when washing it). I used the carafe maybe five times before it broke. These things just seem to spontaneously combust. The carafes are $12 a piece, so it's not worth replacing again. ARGH 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 ... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 The success of this book might be chalked up to the old axiom how no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people.  I was drawn to this book by it's title and central premise.  TOo bad Ben Sherwood can't write worth a lick.  I'm not sure which is more upsetting:  how poorly Ben Sherwood writes, or how low our expectations have fallen as readers, given the number of positive reviews this book has received.   
 This is my 3rd McDermid novel, I previously read 'Mermaids Singing' and 'Wire in the Blood.' McDermid writes good prose but in this 3rd novel I see dangerous repetitions in character types which, if repeated in the next Tony Hill/Carol Jordan book will make that one my last purchase. Generally McDermid paints female police officers as brighter, more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts, as well as more often homosexual. The men, with the exception of leading man Tony Hill, are mostly all egotistical, back-stabbing, power-hungry morons of the lowest order, while Hill is rendered impotent -- a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber. The slow mating dance between Hill and Jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff. And in this book, the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as Dr. Hill. The emotional connection between Hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here, making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought. And the real villain -- not the serial killer but a drug-pushing / illegal-immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer. The climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger. I was extremely disappointed with this book 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 This should of been called "The bad things that happened to me while pet sittng for 8 years." The vast bulk of the book is made up of anectdotes from the author's life that, taken alone, would keep anyone from wanting to become a pet sitter. Although the author obviously has a love of her job, there is not one recount of a positive experience that would explain that love. The reader has to pause in wonder at the author's fear of mice, squirrels, iguanas, and even some cats. If you are a lover of ALL animals, or you if are looking for advice on how to start or improve your business, you will find this book seriously lacking in substance. Written in second (yes, second) person, and full of uninspired language wrapped around poor attempts at humor(ie.repeated use of the phrase 'no pun intended'), this is a disappointment by any measure. Two stars is a generous rating 
 No stories, no inside view, no organization, no reason to waste your time with this book.  I was excited when I bought this book and once I started to read it I was wondering when it would become a good read.  It never did.  The author painted a professional bike racer's life as one big bore.  
 EDIT: I guess this deserves two stars rather than one; after all you can't get this stuff anywhere else.  I was feeling a bit shirty when I gave it one star.  Now, on with the review! - - -  First of all let it be known that the so-called "notebooks" of the title are a fiction. The title implies that during the making of his greatest films Sir Alfred sat down, licked the end of his pencil, and committed to paper all his magic in black and white for the indy filmmakers of posterity to read and emulate.   Well, sadly, there are no long lost secret "notebooks". The creative genius of Hitchcock, much like the plans in The 39 Steps, resided in that little man's head.   What we have instead is distressingly prosaic, and not very educational at all. We get memos, telegrams, more memos, lengthy side by side script draft comparisons, transcripts of conversations, still more memos, and a few storyboards that can be found elsewhere.   And if, upon hearing the name Hitchcock, you think of titles like Psycho, Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, Notorious, and North by Northwest, then prepare to be disappointed. They aren't discussed. Instead we're referred to the author's other books for the first two films and the Criterion laserdisks for the rest. (Laserdisks! Do they even make those anymore? Thanks for nothing, guys.)   We do get a gobsmackingly large amount of stuff about Marnie, though.   But wait, there's more:   We get a thrilling exchange of telegrams discussing whether or not Suspicion is a boring title for a film. (Hitch says yes, his producer says no, then Hitch says yes again, and his producer repeats no. How's that for a look into the mind of a genius?)   We get lengthy memos from people like Hume Cronyn talking about how scene 423 of a second draft of a script that we never have seen nor never will see needs to be revised in some unspecified way.   We learn that the character development in The Birds was a little below par. There's a series of four or five lengthy letters, all saying the same thing, and capped off with this brilliant editorial comment from our learned author: "Of course, the consistent complaint here is the weakness in the character development, something that was never worked out." Thanks, Professor.   We get fuzzy reproductions of the blueprints for the bookshop in Vertigo, should you want to build one of your own.   We get twenty pages of reproduced letters in Hitchcock's illegible handwriting discussing whether or not 3-D is a good idea. At least that's all I could make out.   We get the first draft treatment of Shadow of a Doubt in Thornton Wilder's handwriting. Alas, it too is illegible.   We get pages and pages and pages and pages of material about Marnie. It seems that half the damn book is about Marnie.   We get not one, not two, but three letters from some guy named Otis Guernsey telling Hitch he's welcome to use his germ of an idea for North By Northwest.   We get not just the film-related parts of letters, but the whole blessed thing: paragraph after paragraph of "How's Alma?" and "Drop by the next time you're in town" and letterheads for the Herald Tribune, all taking up valuable space.   We read a memo asking that the dialogue for The Birds needs to be punched up "on pages 6-10, 27-29, 37, 40, 48, 49, 50, 53, 54, 65, 74, 132, 188, and 194."  And so on. Basically, the book seems to have been assembled by dipping at random into Hitchcock's old file cabinets, running every other scrap of paper through a scanner, then presenting the whole pile sans comment. There's a definite rummage sale vibe about the whole thing - the very occasional gem amid lots and lots and LOTS of hooey.   I guess what I'm trying to say is, this one's for the completist.  Anyone who would like to get an insight into the creative thought processes of Hitchcock would be best served by the Truffaut interview book.   As for the rest of you, well, I hope you liked Marnie 
 I find the mostly 5 star reviews of Adam Bede rather puzzling. I am a great of lover nineteenth century English lit, and have enjoyed the other three Eliot books I've read--Middlemarch, Silas Marner, and Mill on the floss, the latter being far and away my favorite. However, had I read Adam Bede first, I may not have bothered to read other Eliot works.   Eliot's talent is indisputable. The other reviews do an excellent job of capturing what is great about her prose, and many of those strengths are present in Adam Bede. What disappointed me most about this work were the characters. Each was far less complex than I have come to expect from Eliot, and I found the saintliness of Seth, Adam, and Dinah boring, almost irritating. It was hard to care about them. I also found, despite the explanations Eliot provided, that Adam's love for Hetty and Dinah's change of heart about marriage was implausible.  What sealed my opinion of this book was Adam's forgiveness of Arthur. After the devastation Arthur's actions caused, it would have been superhuman to forgive him, let alone regard him as a friend. When Arthur asserted that he suffered more than Adam, I could hardly believe that Adam did not recognize yet another expression of Arthur's massive ego.  Despite the book's strengths, this flaw, together with one-dimensional personalities of the main characters, relegates Adam Bede to an inferior status among Eliot's works.  
 Of 12 batteries I purchased, 2 of them were leaking in the box. I would rate these higher except that I also purchased 20 AAAs and 12 of them were leaky. I imagine I was just lucky that only 2 of this size leaked. Take the fact that most of these batteries will be bad when you compare prices. I paid $4.99/4-pack which is a good price as long as more than half of them survive (whick may not be very likely) 
 A reviewer below has made a mistake, or his review was misfiled:  This compilation is not to be confused with "King of the Delta Blues SINGERS."  THAT is the compilation which contains the alternate take of "Traveling Riverside Blues."  It and its companion, "King of the Delta Blues Singers, Volume 2" also have much better mastering than any other Robert Johnson collections that I am aware of.  Unfortunately, between them, ten alternate takes have yet to be upgraded from either mastering of the "Complete" collection.  I have not heard "King of the Delta Blues"--I am basing this information on the song sample Amazon has provided.  But given the song lineup, this is a confusingly unnecessary product 
 Those who describe this story as "cute" and Joon as "quirky" aren't paying attention. For me, this movie was a trip through hell with a final destination of insanity. The writers slickly throw just enough whitewash on top to let most people ignore the darkness. Yes, Depp is great, given what he has to work with, but overall I am very sorry that I was subjected to this horribly stupid, insensitive movie 
 The book had enough facts, figures and information to be a valid source of knowledge for the topic, however it was at times hard to follow. The statistics were thrown out at the reader without any preparation or easing  into the introduced subject.  It went from one topic to another without a  smooth transition. Their transitions were choppy, leaving the reader  feeling unsettled and at times, confused 
 It's taken me a while to get through this book partly because I'm not very excited about the plot and partly because the author's self-conscious writing style really annoys me. There are lovely phrases here and there, but there are plenty of others that read like something you'd find in a greeting card--they try hard to impress and fail. The author makes deliberate, almost constant use of foreshadowing, perhaps in an attempt to get the reader to stick with the book and not lay it down for good. I'm contemplating the latter 
 The Earth's *surface area* is nearly 70% water, but its total mass is a paltry 0.023% H20. That's hardly significant. In the human body, water is distributed differently in various areas: lean muscle tissue contains about 75% water; bood contains about 83% water; body fat contains 25% water and bone has 22% water. Total % body water also varies considerably from infancy to adulthood, between men and women, and between individuals. These things can hardly be considered "coincidence" by any stretch of the imagination. The connection between water and life is well understood, straight-forward, and ,frankly, obvious. There's no need for magical thinking, weird mysticism, or silly books (like this one) to make the point that our water supply is precious and must be protected. Only an *irrational* person would argue against that 
 I believe that I am a pretty good judge of music and I appreciate all types.  But I was really diappointed when I listened to the full CD.  If this represents his BRAND NEW ME then Michael needs to return to his former self.  I have yet to listen to anything else than THE LITTLE GIRL track.  The rest of the CD had no impact on me.  Sorry but, this CD really made me think about all the junk we have to pay for to get to the one most inspiring song.  I wish artists would consider what they are putting out to the public, even if they know that one song can carry the album 
 If you are purely interested in the lives, origins and other facts on the mummies you will be disappointed and find yourself doing a lot of skim reading. Barber is a textiles expert and this is the main focus of the  book. If you are interested in how the mummies lived I would rate this book  a 2, if you are interested in what they wore and how it was made and how  this relates to their origins then it's probably a 4 - some nice photos  though... 
 It blows the dirt around and it doesn't matter how many times I go over the carpet, I end up just going back and picking up debris by hand 
 Don't make the mistake of judging the entire Hard Case Crime series by this lackluster entry.  I can imagine the publishers being overjoyed when Stephen King agreed to write a novel for them and then cringing when they received this manuscript.  The writing is fine, as you'd expect from King, but there's nothing remotely hard-boiled or sexy in this novel.  (Don't let the cover fool you!)  It's simply the meandering story of an apparent murder that happened years before.  There are a couple of interesting hooks, but they certainly don't lead anywhere.  This one's for Stephen King completists only.  
 I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that Dave Marsh's preachiness and know-it-all attitude really is a detriment to this book.  Before I Get Old is well researched and thorough, the only problem is that it takes all the life out of what is one of the most exciting and dangerous rock groups of all time.  Marsh really fails to capture the early days of the Who, because he seems to judge everything as the elitist American reviewer he is.  In other words, he has no sense of humour and doesn't capture the essence of what made the Who what they were.  Pete Townshend is quoted at length, and he can be a real bore, he does his best communicating with a guitar in his hand and writing great songs of angst, rebellion and rage.  Marsh has done some good work here and there, but he is totally out in left field with this one, he really captured nothing of The Who 
 What a sad and depressing book.  I gave it two stars because I didn't want to put the book down- I read it all the way through to see if there was to be any redemption in it.  SPOILER HERE------  Although there was ample foreshadowing about Jonah's 'sickness' and I wasn't surprised by his kidnapping the boy, this was anti-climatic and didn't add any depth to the plot.  In the end, these characters were so pathetic, that reading the book was mostly a wasted day for me.  How sad and without a purpose...these characters were boring, passive and without any redemptive value.  Portraying loneliness is one thing, but this book is just sad and and depressing 
 "Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.    The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.  The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.    With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more. 
 If you just like the cruiser look and will use the bike only occasionally for very short rides (less than 10 miles) then this is probably not a bad bike. BUT, if you want a much more comfortable and efficient bike, and one that will fit your body properly, go to your local bike shop and ask to see their "hybrid" bikes. This type of bike gets its name from being a cross between a "road bike" and a "mountain bike" or "all terrain" bike. They are available in several frame sizes, so you're not stuck with "one-size-fits-all", which is NOT good if you are shorter than about 5'7 or taller than about 5'10. Hybrids are available in a wide range of prices and equipment selections. The price will range from just over $200 to as high as you want to go (over $1500 anyway). As the price goes up, the weight generally goes down and the quality of the frame and all components goes way up. But even at the low end of the scale, a hybrid will be a much more efficient bike to ride (more miles covered per energy expended) and it will be more comfortable on longer rides (over 10 miles). If you are truly interested in covering some longer distances (up to maybe 30-40 miles) focus on the models that feature 700C wheels as opposed to 26-inch--your bike shop person can explain--and keep the tire width down to 35mm or under (28mm is a good size for most people if they ride only on pavement). The narrower tires offer less "rolling resistance" making the bike easier to pedal and the larger wheel sizes improves efficiency a little also.  Happy peddaling, A VERY experienced cyclis 
 Having read some of Leckie's books in the past, I was looking forward to taking on this one. In the end it was a complete let down. I felt that many of the author's interpretations were biased by having been a Marine and a participant in many of the events covered in the book. He's quick to lavish praise on any Marine yet seems unable to complement any other service (particularly the Army). Likewise, the Japanese were always being put down. Their generals were inferior, their tactics were inferior, they were incapable of sound judgement, the Marine Corps's the best, etc. Granted, the United States won the war, but Japan was a fierce and capable foe, not a bunch of bumbling idiots. Along the same lines, he continualy refered to the Japanese as "Japs." Were he simply quoting some Marine that would be acceptible, however he used the word through out the text simply as a label for anything Japanese. In the end, I felt that I was getting anything but a balanced, scholarly interpretation of the war in the Pacific, it was more like reading a Marine Corps recruitment pamphlet. If you want to read something really good by this author, try "George Washington's War. 
 Ice T is a air force pilot turned evil doer for hire in this action "thriller".  Apparently on US Air Bases, they don't lock anything and easily allow their stealth jets to be taken.  Also, the guards that are supposedly looking out for people trying to break in to the base are completely surprised, when the exact thing they are supposed to be doing happens, and allow themselves to be shot.  And where exactly did a man that feined his own death get at least 5 bank accounts all in different countries?  Wouldn't it suffice just to have one Swiss bank account?  Apparently not for Ice T.  Of course in the conclusion he is ultimately spoiled by a wristwatch with no band, that can apparently counteract all the stealth features of his jet.  I would recommend this movie, but it is terrible.. 
 When I started reading this book, I was excited.  After all his first book was a laugh-a-minute.  The reviews of this book were upbeat and funny, however, I didn't think it was at all.  The plot jumped around a bit, and the whole animal rights point of view was pushed a little to far.  I don't disagree with the notion, but I fell it killed the story.  And the ending wasn't that great either.  It felt like at about 80% through the book, the ending happened, and then the last 20% was either to bring the word count up, or just to give a 'readers digest' version of the rest of the main characters lives 
 I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me 
 I found the vocal delivery on this CD too distracting to allow me to relax. The frequent hesitations and awkward phrases prevent any sense of flow. The narrator's soft, lilting voice is not by itself hard on the ears, but too often it sounds like she is improvising and reaching for words. 
    Lets be honest, no one really likes this band. Its all bandwagon, afraid of appearing stupid and unadventurous nonsense. If tame punk with Geddy Lee(of Rush great band)meets Diamanda Galas(great singer and composer) vocals is your cup of tea then by all means pick this up. But please there is far too much interesting music out there to waste your time with this. Check out Ash Ra Tempel, Robbie Basho, Scratch Acid, Boris, Dalek, and Borbetomagus instead 
 A retrospective of the photographer's work, not useful as a guide to how to. And of kinds of buildings we're not likely to photograph today. Didn't help me with clues to photographing interiors 
 This was my first Hilary Mantel book, i bought it on the strength of the Philip Pullman recommendation on the front cover and he has gone down in my estimation for it, although i should know better than to buy the book on that basis.  Entertaining at times, sometimes clever and funny, but overall the book left me feeling pretty empty, there was no real denouement, it just finished and i was left with the feeling "so what?".  It is much more disappointing when a book has some promise but fails to fulfil it as opposed to being complete trash fiction 
 After finishing the 70-290 book in the set and taking the exam, I am shocked at how "out of touch" this book is with the actual exam.  Topics that were barely touched upon in the book ended up being huge sections in the test and vice versa.  I started buying Sybex cert books because of how well the CCNA book was done and how it actually related to the exam.  I'm hoping the other books in this kit are a little more up to par 
 I have never written a comment about a book, but hopefully other people will at least be warned.  This is the one of the worst books I've ever read.  I have read several Wiley books; most of them are poorly written and lacking substance.  This one is unbelievably bad.   This book deserves a negative five stars.  (Who wrote those other reviews?) If you have never read a book on trading systems, then this book is may tell you something. Otherwise, save your money.  There's nothing here 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 This collection is a must have if you like the Bee Gees and don't have any of their albums...or even if you do. It's one hit after another plus some I've never heard, which is nice for variety. I couldn't ask for a better collection - it's like I had burned this for myself.   
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 THE EVIL THAT MEN DO Nancy Holder (2000)  RATING:  2/5 Stakes  SETTING:  Season Three  CAST APPEARANCES:  Buffy, Joyce, Willow, Oz, Xander, Giles, Angel, Cordelia, Willy the Snitch, Devon, Sheila Rosenberg, Ira Rosenberg  MAJOR ORIGINAL CHARACTERS:  Helen, Julian (ancient Roman vampires); Jordan Smythe (flunky); Mark Dellasandra (high schooler); Nick Daniels (Bronze manager); Claire Bellamy (Bronze); Diana (ancient Roman Slayer)  BACK-OF-THE-BOOK SUMMARY:  "After a vicious shooting spree, the town of Sunnydale is shell-shocked.  What could have sparked the random rampage?  Buffy Summers can guess.  Considering the prophetic dreams she's been having, the Slayer suspects possession by an especially malevolent force.  As the police follow their typical false leads, the Slayerettes start up their own research into possible paranormal causes.  But when Oz's van is discovered on the side of the road, minus one teen wolf, a distraught Willow turns on Buffy, disrupting the investigation.  With the pressure in Sunnydale mounting, the residents' reactions to stress grow increasingly unpredictable.  The Slayer continues her search for answers, narrowly surviving an attack by a well-trained and powerful vampire who brought a gruesome death to every Slayer who crossed her path.  Is this the ancient creature behind the recent influx of evil?  Or is there another influence . . . close to home?"  REVIEW  	Set-Up:  What do you get when you mix Nancy Holder, two ancient Roman vampires, and a plot to raise an ancient deity to destroy the world?  Punchline:  An incredibly boring Buffy novel titled The Evil That Men Do.  I perhaps shouldn't be quite so harsh, as there is one or two good ideas in the novel, it's just that on the whole the book lacks energy, humor, surprises, creativity, and all of those other things one looks for in a good novel. 	Helen and Julian, two vampires from the age of Caligula, have waited several centuries for a chance to call forth the goddess Meter and rule the world.  When they hatch their vile scheme in Sunnydale, the water supply gets laced with an "everyone turn evil" drug, turning citizen against citizen as "all hell breaks loose."  Seriously . . .  it's just plain bad. 	Our Terrible Twosome of bad guys have standard villain personas:  Julian is the suave, cultured, smarmy James Bond movie villain, while Helen is the vicious, want-to-kill-everything-that-moves type of villain.  Their backstory is fairly interesting, even if it takes a while to get moving.  As for the Scoobies, they're all fulfilling their standard roles:  Cordelia gets kidnapped, Oz shapechanges, Buffy stakes.  The book just doesn't have much life to it, and should be avoided in favor of the many better ones out there.  [... 
 I measured the reservoir and got only 2 liters plus a cup 
 I'm sorry to say that this book is typical of christian books on sex.  The authors have a pre-determined opinion on a sexual subject, look for passages in the bible to support their opinion, then say that this proves they were right.  They, like most christian authors, use the more common MISTRANSLATIONS of the bible (e.g. King James Version) and also ignore the passages in the bible that contradict their opinions.  They also ignore what are the common interpretations of passages by biblical SCHOLARS (people who know what the bible means by studying the bible and related texts for most of their lives, along with the history and languages of the biblical cultures) and instead choose to believe whatever is the common interpretation that people they know have chosen.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  If you truly want to learn about sex, you should do so from someone with at least a rudimentary education.  God gave us a capacity for learning.  I don't believe he wanted us to blindly follow people who have no good reason for what they believe other than that's just what everyone they know thinks.  Also, the reason why so many women give high praises to this book in their reviews is that the author, since she is giving only opinions, tells misconceptions about what the bible says about sex that are believed by other women, thus reinforcing these misconceptions as well as earning praise for saying things with which others already wanted to believe.  If you are in a marriage, think very carefully about what the effect will be if you do (or more likely do NOT do) the things this book says 
 When I flipped thru it at the book store it looked interesting.  When I started to read it at home my eyes glazed over.  The subject is very interesting, too bad the book is so boring 
 This Huberman birdcage liner or cup coaster, or whatever it is, is completely incoherent.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from it.  On the other hand, Bernard Goldberg's "100 People Who Are Screwing Up America" is an excellent read and if you haven't bought it yet, you really ought to do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy. 
 This disc is BAD!!! Right at the 2" mark the sound of the "rock water" is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub. This sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour. Other discs of this type that I've heard don't do this 
 This book applies to women who are in leadership positions, which I am not, so I despise the title "Nine Secrets Every Working Woman Must Know". It's misleading. I'm currently reading this book and have only found a small paragraph that applies to "every working woman." Given the title, I thought the book would give helpful tips on getting ahead for the average working woman, but it doesn't. Needless to say, it didn't do me much good for where I am currently in my career. 
 Louise Riotte passed away in 1998 at the age of 89.   Since her passing, the subject matter contained in this title is widely disseminated free on the internet.  Her father taught her to believe in and practice astrology, her mother was a practicing herbalist.   Together they influenced her life and her books, Astrological Gardening, Sleeping with a Sunflower, and her Raising Animals by the Moon. 
 How could anyone call DEL HEDGEPATH a success when all he is doing is ripping off poor college kids by renting out delapidated, unlivable houses to people can't afford otherwise. Better research should be done not to martyr a con artist 
 This is a bubble gum type of book that does not teach anything about making money on the markets. It is a platform to sell Investor Business Daily services. If you want to learn trading look for articles written by Toby Crabel or Arthur Merrill, even Linda Raschke. They are full time professional money managers that happend to write few articles... some of them you can probably find on Ebay for cheaper... 
 As a Renaissance scholar I was disappointed and shocked by the sloppy inaccuracies in Ms. Scotti's text.  While she tells an engaging story, she gets many of the fundamentals of history and architecture wrong.  The story, indeed, is one worthy of being told.  Ms. Scotti, however, does not have the teeth to do it well 
 The book was poor but had a lot of good photo of stevie nicks, I have walked with stevie on her long road of life for meany year now, 20 and counting. If you are looking to find yourself for who you are look to  stevie nicks. PELA STEVIE ALWAYS BE TRUE TO YOURSELF 
 Absolutely without a doubt the best thing about Teitler's `Taming and Training Cockatiels' is the wonderful color photographs, but aren't most color photographs of cockatiels charming?  Decent photographs are  insufficient criteria to distinguish a book on birds.  The book is written  in a boring style that reads like, `look, here are my pets, aren't they  great?' The book lacks focus and unsuccessfully attempts to cover too much  material.  There are promising introductory sections intended for readers  that have never owned a bird before where instructions on making `first  contact' without terrorizing the cockatiel are given.  However, just a few  pages later there is a large section on breeding birds.  Surely it's unwise  for a novice who wants a tame, loveable pet bird to delve into breeding at  the same time?  If the author had focused on one area, such as a guidebook  for the new bird owner while avoided irrelevant distractions, I might have  been able to suggest this book 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 I must agree with the review that appeared this week in the TLS (Times Literary Supplement, London, 27.01.00), which managed to describe the book without talking about the social character of knowledge - except to say  that Goldman has a 'dirigiste' view of how knowledge should be controlled  and communicated in society. His own euphemism is 'epistemic paternalism',  and readers might want to judge for themselves what it all means, once the  dogmatic philosophising and gratuitous formalising is removed. This reader  found the implications rather scarey, though luckily this philosophical  stuff rarely gets beyond the seminar room. A definite step from back (and  away) from Fuller's work on social epistemology - and even more  conservative types like Kitcher and Longino 
 The author wrote a book on sexuality, while considerably lacking knowledge about women and female sexuality 
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 this book talks more about acupressure and how to use it but  does not go into that much depth for accupunture.  
 Tosches is a bore, a literary con man and his tough-guy narcissist act hits bottom with this stinkeroo. While his books aren't, strictly speaking, good, they usually are have at least one memorable moment. Here, though, Tosches' unrelenting and petulant self-pity makes for a very ugly book. 
 the radio has no presets so you have to manually click through radio stations til you find the one you want. the clips breaks off easily. the pedometer just stops working. mine stopped working after 1 month, i returned for a new one which stopped working in 2 weeks. don't bother buying cause it won't last long enough to be worth it 
 When Pokemon first debuted, I thought it would rock, and Misty, Brock, and Ash would stay together as a gang forever, and Ash would love it to just be walking around the world, earning badges, etc., and that's the way it would stay. Maybe even Ash and MIsty would fall in love! But, nope. The dudes who are creating these movies are sucking kids in with exclusive Pokemon cards, and the animation is just getting cheaper. This movie is totally different from the original movies and the TV series, and it sucks. I'll hold on to the older series and DVD's, but, nowadays, Brock and Misty are gone, and it's just boring without them. For those who agree with me, get the message out there that Pokemon is going down the tubes and it stinks. Bring back Brock and Misty!!! IT WILL SAVE THE SERIES! Oh, and I'm only giving this movie two stars because they went so far as to make a movie about something so ridiculous, with so much change, and so little things the same. :-( Boo 
 When I purchased this, I was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped.   The skin is so thin, that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons.  The belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that I used it.  Don't waste your money, spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while.  
 I'm perhaps the only Steinbeck lover not to have yet read "Grapes of Wrath" or "East of Eden."  Instead I have focused on "Of Mice and Men" and his lesser known works, such as "To a God Unknown" and, my personal favorite, "Pastures of Heaven."  I've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular.  When I began reading "In Dubious Battle," it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbeck's work.  Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating himself into Mac's radical cell.  There is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar, work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers.  Early on, the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging.  Suddenly, Steinbeck simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again.  After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker's strike, I expected the sense of excitement to continue.  It simply never does.  Summary of "In Dubious Battle" - Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking.  And while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book.  Most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense...  ...and eating.  Steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story, because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding, eating, and (worst of all) TALKING about food.  There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes to mind.  Steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters.  But I advise any reader of "In Dubious Battle" to take this course - after the strike is initiated, simply set the book down.  You won't miss anything.  Nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces.  I suppose now I'll give "Grapes of Wrath" a go.  Perhaps if it isn't one of his "greats," it isn't worth reading 
 I was so excited when I ordered my Star Wars Holographic Emperor figure. I'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks!! When I got home today, the box with the Amazon logo was on my doorstep. Upon opening the box, I was completely disappointed to find that the Emperor figure I'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed. The people packing this stuff are half-wits!! Anybody with a brain would know better than to  cram something into a box like that!! They should be ashamed of their service & to all you collectors out there....BEWARE!! 
 I loved "A Walk in the Woods" and "In a Sunburned Country".  They were funny and witty, and made me want to hike the Trail and visit Australia.  I am about to travel to Great Britain, so I read this book with much anticipation.  I found it ill-spirited and mostly humorless.  I started skimming as it was so repetitive that any chapter could have been about any town he visited.  It almost made me NOT want to go to Great Britain.  I don't understand the reviews that say he talks fondly of England.  In my opinion, he bad-mouthed almost everything, and came out looking like an often foul-mouthed old curmudgeon.  If you're still interested in this book, check it out of a library and decide for yourself.  I'm sorry I spent any time on it, but glad I didn't waste any money. I gave it 2 stars to be charitable 
 A close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera.  Honestly Olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $400.  I've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10.  If you're going to spend that much on a camera, get the D70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with.  The pictures are better and it offers more MP 
 To be fair, the legends of Herakles, as they were originally written, have little to do with this movie, but maybe that's for the best.  Having grown up on Superman, Batman and the Justice League, I have a hard time calling a person like Herakles a hero.  In the original legends, he was a warrior, but also a brute who eventually wound up killing his wife and children in a fit of rage.  He also wasn't, as far as I can tell, as strong as in this version. Therefore, interpretations of Herakles are, I think, to be judged not on whether or not they deviate from the legend, but on where and why. Disney has attempted to take Herakles (or Hercules, in the Roman) and make it a story about a true hero, and a perfect one at that.  There's nothing I like more than perfect heroes.  They inspire me.  Conceptually, I like the idea. Instead of Herakles being the illegitimate son of Zeus and a mortal woman, he's conceived in love by Zeus and Hera and turned mortal by a potion.  Not bad.  As changes go, it works better than most. Herc meets Meg at the beginning of his hero carreer and falls instantly in love with her and she with him (another deviation from the legend, and a very good improvement.)  Of course, because Hera is his mother in this version, she can't be Herc's enemy, so they make his opponent Hades; lord of the dead, which could be worse, as changes go.  I've never seen Hades as being all that bad of a guy, but that's how it goes.  Then there's the Hydra, which is, if anything, much larger and more powerful than it was originally, so that's good too.  Aside from this, however, I have to say I was disappointed with most of the changes. The titans, to start with, were underplayed considerably.  It might have been premature to mention that they were Zeus' predecessors, but they could at least have given them powers similar to what they actually had, and a roughly-similar appearance.  Oceanus, for example, lashing out with blasts of water from his hands like a fire hose, or Cronos reversing the movements of his olympian enemies would have made for an excellent action sequence, particularly since Hercules didn't beat the titans alone in the original stories, nor does it make sense that he should in this one (grabbing a whirlwind?  Come ON now.) I actually didn't mind Hades' used-car-salesman demeanor all that much, though I didn't see a reason why he should have flame-based powers when that's clearly Apollo's territory.  Further, I thought most of the Gods and Muses were given no credit at all in terms of their innately glorious nature. Why is this the case?  I think Disney made the mistake, in this film, of not just trying to make the legends clean, but FUN as well, and there's nothing fun about war.  I'm not saying they couldn't have made the concept work.  In fact, I'm saying they could have made it work if they'd toned down the comedy and given the characters a bit of respect (Justice League style.) Still, for what it's worth, this is one of the few movies left in the world that isn't afraid to dwell on the concept of a hero, and for that it's worth at least one viewing.  Rent it from your local video store, in my opinion, before you make your decision 
 When I read this book several years ago, I had no idea what I was getting into.  I had seen the movie, and although I didn't love it, the movie was ok, and a book is always supposed to be better than the movie.  At first the book seemed merely very unlikely.  Then as I continued reading I began to feel a little uncomfortable with certain characters.  The one friend who was supposedly a compulsive eater sounded no different than me, and I am not even considered chubby.  The one new girlfriend was disgusting, not only in what she did, but in how she lived her life.  The only saving grace to the entire book was the general plot.  Although very unbelievable, it was also very satisfying to see these men get what they deserved in life, but honestly the women did not deserve the satisfaction they experienced from the men's downfalls.  Thank goodness I had just borrowed the book from the library and not bought it 
 Bottom line:  I like Al Bielek's version of the PX better.  This one is more to the original story.  I like Al Bielek's personal account of time traveling.  This book is more about the "facts" of the account.  No Al Bielek in this book 
 This (text)book is difficult to understand -not just because of many typos and grammatical errors. The content summarises the concepts introduced in Goldratts novels. Half the book looks like a reprint of The Goal -and yet Goldratt recommends on more than one occasions to re-read the novel.... I enjoyed the novels, but this book looks more like a marketing gag for Goldratts seminars or the journal he writes, publishes and sells 
 Anyone else disappointed in this book? It seems to center on the wardrobe the most. I know it is difficult for the authors to show detailed images of the vehicles of the first trilogy, since they are all digital. But this book pales in comparison to the first Star Wars Chronicles. I can't recommend it as you can find pretty much the same material in the "Making of" EP1,2,3 books, all of which can be found for cheap.   The photographs all seemed washed out...all lacking crisp rich colors as in the first book. For the costumemaker/modelmaker/toy collector/true fanboy this book would be a great addition..I personally am not satisfied.  
 Camera Obscura is similar, in an inferior manner, to Nico, of the Velvet Underground & Nico.  The band makes pleasantly dull "chamber pop" in the vein of Belle & Sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years.  Even their name is ripped off of Nico's last studio album, Camera Obscura.  But, as I said before, Camera Obscura is much worse than Nico.  If you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like, pick up "Chelsea Girl," Nico's first solo album 
 Interesting to see a book like this come from Prestowitz, former Undersecretary in the Reagan Administration.   Back then it was America losing its good jobs and future to the Japanese.  Remember them?  Japan, Inc....central planning...national industrial policy...would soon be running the world.  American debt, loss of technological edge, outsourcing would all mean the USA would be reduced to second-world status by 2006.  It was precisely because Prestowitz's Commerce Department let the 'hidden hand' of the market prevail that we wound up with the economic boom of the 90s.  So it is very strange to see Prestowitz ring the same alarm bells he firmly rejected a generation ago.  Seems every economic book I read these days remeinds me of the early 80s....alarmist.  That is not to deny the issues he raises in this book, but to paint a grim and destitute future for the American economy is tired and not well thought out.  That, in the end, is why this book only gets two stars.  Intellectually it's bereft.  Nothing new here 
 When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along.  This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice.  Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book.  It is self-indulgent and inane.  If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it.  I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful 
 The book isn't the one in the picture or the one you can view.  It is a MINIATURE ADDITION.  It only has a few pages and minimal information.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! 
 Well, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there.    The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death. Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna's death. This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer.   	Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. Kinsey also checks up on Lorna's family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna.  	 Not being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn't know if the book had actually ended. All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 .... you can get all three of these wacky books in one neat volume! Doesn't this hurt the bottom line at Hagee Ministries? What, has the pool of his mesmerized followers begun to dry up? It reminds me of when the band, KISS (aka Kings In Satan's Service) re-packaged their first three albums as "The Originals." At least in that case you had an extra track of "Rock and Roll All Nite", assuming you already had the album "Dressed To Kill." On the other hand, maybe Hagee Ministries was using the KISS model, assuming that it wouldn't hurt to have his drivel repeated in one handy, compact volume of fear 
 Terrorists strike an America oil refinery with a small nuclear bomb. In steps Major Jason Richter, Army nerd extraordinaire, with his super CID exoskeleton. The hero of the hour saves a busload of kids, along with a beautiful reporter, and promptly gets placed on the newest war-on-terror team. The team starts to tackle the terrorist group responsible, but the team seems to be set up for failure with conflicting personalities and egos. The battles rage on around the globe, as Major Richter tries to pull the team together, find the mastermind behind the plots, and save his country from another disastrous attack.  Techno, yes; thriller, no. This book started out with promise and I really wanted to like it. But after the introduction of the major characters and gadgets, it quickly becomes cliched and predictable. The nifty new weapons systems would play much better with believable characters and a realistic plot. The pacing is fast, but the many twists and turns feel forced. Dale Brown is perfectly capable of writing exciting techno-thriller books with good characters - but this is not one of them 
 Although vivid, most of the essays in this book are far too short to address the complexities of each different personality.  Beschloss's essay is the best; Morris', Caro's, and McCullough's good but inferior to their  respective biographies of Reagan, Johnson and Truman.  Goodwin's essay  doesn't add much, and the editors get docked a star by choosing Benjamin  Bradlee - of all people - to review Richard Nixon.  A more impartial person  and Nixon biographer (Stephen Ambrose?  Tom Wicker?) would have been more  appropriate.  I think you are better off simply getting the biographies of  Reagan, LBJ, Truman, and Clinton by Morris, Caro, McCullough, and Maraniss,  respectively 
 The whole book just meandered from the get-go, never going anywhere.  One could surmise early who would be killed and who the killer would be, but the murder was certainly an afterthought.  I'm also tired of Qwill's relationship with the boring Polly.  And the great number of times he mentions his mustache.  A great disappointment!  -- Pa 
 I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other  of Anne Tyler's books.  This book deals with the life of a depressed  teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not  recommend reading it.  On the up side, it's really short so you can get  through it rather quickly.  I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt  worse after finishing this one 
 The title, as one other reader said, is a giveaway that this author has a strange attitude about antisemitism.  Esau cried when Jacob, one of the founders of Judaism, 'stole' his birthright.  As the title implies, so the theme of the book: Jewish success and competition causes others to hate them.  While this is undoubtedly one factor in antisemitism, no respected authority in the field gives it dominance over the teaching of hate by the Church, the need of dictators for scapegoats, or how societies mistreat helpless subgroups.    For of course, there are many elite groups in society whose success invites both emulation and envy (the rich, celebreties, sports heros, old money etc) without leading to conspiracy theories and murderous movements towards those successful people.     Robert Wistrich ("Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred") is one of the most respected authorities today on antisemitism.  His review of this books says, "... in this deeply pernicious book. Although some chapters are more balanced than others, Lindemann's presentation throughout is marked not only by sympathy for the arguments of anti-Semites but by an undisguised antipathy toward Judaism and Jews. It is appalling that Cambridge University Press has put its distinguished imprint on so profoundly biased and ignominious a work 
 If what you're looking for is lush, plush truly thick towels, these are NOT it. If you want Pottery Barn luxe, you'll have to go there. These are a poor substitute. I could not have been more disappointed. I returned them all. 
 This book provides nothing new.  It is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck.  If you have 401k, duh, it does that automatically...anyway, boring.  It also says to save money, don't use credit cards, pay yourself, blah, blah, blah.  Oh yeh, if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years...zzzz.   Ok, it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks.  One idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account.  Upon reading this, I decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal .2% I've been earning on my saving account.  And not realizing the latest craze started by ING, all the other banks offer an "online savings" account which offers 5% compare to the dismal .2%.  I immediately switched!  Other than this part of the book, it was boring 
 I was actually disappointed with this book. I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point. For me, there wasnt much suspense. Overall it kept me occupied and now I'm starting a new book 
 Thank God I didn't and picked it up as a Bookcrossing book. No, seriously, what do I really think? YAWN! I've just finished chapter 8 and am still waiting for her to do something interesting. Although each chapter starts off with a quote about spying, the amount of "spying" she's done so far is contained in a paragraph and involves a short phone call. The rest of what I've read is devoted to  meandering through her past, in no particular chronological order, in the middle of nothing and jumps back to the present. Her memories are mainly about boyfriends she had or wished she had, small incidents about her past job that she hated(Doesn't hold a candle to The Devil Wears Prada), being cool and doing drugs in college. She spends most of the present trying to be cool with the homeboys in her office by making wisecracks on the fire escape during smoke breaks, or getting plastered and obsesses on a man, any man, as she can't seem to live a week without one no matter how much a loser. I'm afraid I can't finish this either. I have too many other books waiting to be read. I'm disappointed though because the title sounds like an interesting story 
 When do you actually sit and listen to 2 hours of the same artist, especially when those two hours include every piece of crap that artist ever pinched out?  The middle ten of the 43 songs on here are excellent, edgy, and not completely slaving to any certain genre.  But the old stuff is just proto-60s psychadelic rock (as if it could get more primitive).  I congratulate him for inventing it, but it just doesn't hold up.  There is also a bunch of knock-off Dylan on here.  No good.  If you want to hear the best stuff, I recommend "I Think of Demons," or if you have the dough, "The Evil One," which have the good songs.  
 The bottom line is a "Hits" collection should be actual recordings of the songs the way they were presented when they rose to popularity on the charts.  Who wants to hear a re-worked version without the original vocalist?    Just for an example:  As much as most people love Paul McCartney you all know there would be a "revolution" if he went back and re-recorded the Beatles stuff replacing John and George's vocal tracks with his own, releasing it as a "Beatles Greatest Hits" CD.    I was so disappointed with the re-worked "Take It Easy On Me" that I plan to just get a copy of the original album that it was on.  Just my 2 cents 
 After listening to this, I would not recommend it to the casual listener.  A very odd and certainly different vocal selections.  Still not one of my favorite singers 
 My 5-1/2 year old son received this for Christmas.  He loves pirates and legos, so it seemed a perfect fit.  We were wrong! The Mega Bloks are poorly made, and it's very difficult (even for an adult) to get the pieces to stay together.  Imagine how frustrating this is for a child.....we will never purchase Mega Bloks products again, we're sticking to the original LEGOs!  Nothing more satisfying than spending money on a gift that makes your child scream and cry in frustration...thanks MegaBloks 
 This is probably the worst book I have ever read. Granted the topic can be very vague and confusing at time, the author makes little attempt tp explain adequately the concepts.   Would highly recommend NOT getting this book 
 Let me start out by saying that I love Tivoli radios. I have a Model Two with a Model Sub-woofer in my living room and truly love the warm, rich sound along with the simple design and good looks. I liked the Model Two so much that I decided to buy the Model Three for the bedroom. Even in Mono mode, the sound is rich and exceptional and the tuner truly does pull in and lock onto FM stations as advertised. It looks beautiful and I had planned to order the up-firing companion speaker and have the ultimate clock radio. The problem I have is that as at least one other reviewer has stated the back light for the clock dial is so bright that I have not been able to sleep since I got the radio four days ago. I mean it is bright, you can make shadow figures on the wall from the light it puts out. I had to put a sock over the dial just to get some sleep. Now I feel foolish to have a $200.00 clock radio that I have to cover with a sock at night. Also the LEDS for the sleep and alarm function are bright enough alone to keep you awake. If you use the sleep function the LED stays on after the radio shuts off until you depress the button again and of course the alarm LED stays on all the time the alarm is set. Since Tivoli designed this to be a "bedroom radio" it is an inexcusable design flaw to not have include a means of toning down or disabling the back light for users that would prefer darkness while sleeping. I haven't tried the snooze function yet so haven't experienced the "snooze flaw" other reviewers have but it sounds pretty scary. One other clock flaw I experienced is that if I get home from work and go through my routine of getting everything ready for the next day before I settle in for the evening I discoverd that the 12 hour clock will sound the alarm if you try to set it for the next day within it seems a 2 hour window after the time you want to set the clock for the next day. In other words if you have the alarm set to wake up at 6:00 A.M. you can't activate the alarm until after 8:00 P.M. This bothers me because I personally have over slept more often by simply forgetting to set the alarm. In conclusion I cannot recommend buying this clock radio until Tivoli takes it back to the drawing board. 
 If Julia Glass had not set the bar so high with Three Junes, I would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2.  There are sentences, paragraphs, even pages of brilliance in this book, but it is as if winning the National Book Award gave Ms. Glass unconditional confidence in her writing, and character development in particular.  She seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around.  As another reviewer wrote, the writing process seemed transparant.  Reading the book, you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass (a privileged white woman of a certain age) imagines teenagers, or New Mexicans, or black chauffeurs, or Hispanic nannies, or even gay people to be like.  She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them.  The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures.  Greenie might be the most believable, and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy Alan, I wasn't sucked along with her when she falls in love with "the other Charlie".  He was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth (even temporarily) losing your child over.  With Saga, she manages to develop her most sympathetic character, but Saga's life is left floating and unresolved at the end.  Even the brief appearance of Fenno, who I loved in Three Junes, lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky.  All and all, a very disappointing second novel.  You have to wonder, since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character, what good is her editor?  
 Very disappointing and BORing! NO likeable characters, VERY uninteresting story.  Could/Would not finish--too many "better" books waiting 
  if they pooped on a piece of paper. This is a ridiculous story, and absolute abortion of writing. I would rather have my life ended than have to read one more word of this travesty.  Some wit declared 20 years to be the time elapsed before he would pick up a book to read so that time could expose tripe like this. Another well reviewed book that won accolades and honestly started with an interesting story through 70 pages (even though it was a cheap literary ploy). But there was no plot, the characterization was horrid (yeah, two pompous and pretentious millionaire girls are going to leave a life of luxury during a war to become nurses...yeah, happens every day). Reading this was like have a needle stuck in your eye after you body is set completely ablaze as you stub your toe really, really, really hard.    And that dumb little girl on the front? Terrible. If there was a monkey on the cover on this book doing something cool, like peeing on the little girl as she screamed, and some of the pee got in her mouth, now that would be awesome, but the book inside you still stink. At least it'd look cool, though.  Basically, if you liked the Kite Runner you're a moron and will like this nonsense. 
 I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous.  It did not come across as a "Sixth Sense" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field.  It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all.  The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way.  I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it.  It didn't.  Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character.   This book was a huge disappointment!  I would not recommend that anyone waste their time.  In the end, when all is "revealed" nothing makes sense.  No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!  
 Without trying to sound overly negative this is subpar engineering and production at its finest.  First, I was expecting something that would assemble "in minutes"... guess when you dont qualify how many that years are also broken into "minutes".. this unit has roughly 60 individual pieces that require assembly not including nuts and bolts.  Finish was VERY poorly applied and rust was already visible on the carbon steel on the underside of the side burner.  Guage of steel for the cart assembly is subpar.  Amazon has been very good to deal with and is refunding my puchase and returning the grill.  There are many better systems available out there than this.  Very disappointing merchandise and misleading advertising on the manufacturers end.  I made the mistake of buying prior to any of these units being available locally because I thought I was getting a good deal 
 This is one party I'm glad I wasn't invited to. Celebrity couple Joe (novelist and now director) and Sally Therrian (actress) throw a party to celebrate their 6th anniversary. It's been a rocky marriage with jealousy and petty squabbling. They throw a party with "close" friends, neighbors they are feuding with and a up and coming actress that Sally feels her career threated with. It gets messy as the night goes along and lots is said and done because they are tripping on Ecstasy.   Another the-world-spins-around-me movie. I don't know which would be worse, to have be surrounded by people like them or to be them. 
 I am running Win 2000 pro SP4, w/SOYO Dragon Plus motherboard SY-K7V on my pc and the USB drivers have been a problem.  I have had to reinstall them several times and the system has a hard time finding them on the disk.  Very little support at the Belkin web site as well. I have gotten the card to run and when it does its great.  But when you reboot it trys and fails to reinstall the hardware. I would not recommend this for anyone seeking to add USB 2.0 ports to their pc 
 When this book arrived, it had obviously been handled very poorly during the packaging process. There were smudges and rips all over the cover, detracting from the book's appeal as a coffee table book. I returned it to a local Borders and requested they order a replacement, but I'm still waiting for the new book to come in. This has been very frustratin 
 Ms. RavenWolf's book "Angels: Companions in Magick" is yet another example of her poor taste, lack of insight and research and worst of all, her all-consuming hatred of Christianity and her sickening bigotry.  Ms. RavenWolf feels that angels fit perfectly into the Wiccan belief system. She explains her belief in stating that in fact, angels predate all religions and that they adapt to fit into every human belief system so that all spirits are in fact to be considered angelic - but at the same time, she states that most angels are products of pagan religious thought. Talk about a contradiction in terms.. Ms. RavenWolf has this neurotic idea that the Christians "stole" the pagan gods and turned all of them into angels and demons, and that:  "The Church allowed Michael to assume many of the Pagan archetypal powers in an effort to lure the people away from their mother religions." (Page 24)  Ms. RavenWolf should seriously consider picking up a book on anthropology, history, archaeology or theology before making such a completely unacceptable statement. Yeah, there will always be a merging of the gods of and old religion into the gods of a new religion, such as the Wiccan faith. No, the real world is not a role-playing game, we pagans are not the Chosen People and the Church is NOT the evil Technocracy or whatever...  In her writings about the archangel Michael, she states the following:  "Michael means "Who is God," and therefore can be seen as the Pagan godform. (...) Like Raphael, he was worshipped as a god of the Chaldeans. Therefore, before his involvement with Christianity, Islam, or Judaism, he was (drom roll, please) Pagan. Yes, just like the good, old Christmas tree and the Easter bunny, guess who had him first? Not the current structured religions. They borrowed him like many of the other angels and made him over to fit within their belief structures." (Page 23)  Personally, I'm absolutely speechless. THEY "borrowed him and made him over" to fit their belief structures?! What are you in fact doing yourself, Ms. Ravenwolf? I mean, seriously, does she actually believe that we will fall for that?  By the way, the "good old" Christmas tree is a tradition invented by the Germans in the 19th century... And I just don't see what the goddam Easter Bunny has to do with the archangel Michael. Is that the best she can do to try to prove her theory about how much the nasty, conniving Christians stole from us?  Still on the topic of the archangel Michael, get a load of this:  "He stands firm as the guardian of the Goddess on the astral planes, wherein he protects Her energy from the onslaughts of the patriarchy." (Page 24)  Does this woman actually believe that a great big war between the wholesome, balanced Goddess and the evil, twisted "patriarchy" is being fought on the astral planes...?? Wow. I guess she would like it to be that way, but seriously... wow.  At one point in this horrid abomination of a book, Ms. RavenWolf goes on to recount how she visited a Catholic gift store to buy an angel medal. Here follows yet another unbelievable gem...  "I felt odd wandering among religious items that were strange to me, but at the same time I felt good that I was secure enough in my own faith to look someone else's full in the face and honour their belief system without feeling condescending about theirs or stupid about mine." (Page 48)  WTF?? That's a nice thing to say - if you actually mean it. If you say it and you don't mean it, it's called hypocrisy.  "It took a while for me to find a Miraculous Medal without a cross on it. I won't use any jewellery that has a cross, as that sigil denotes attack and has negative connotations for me." (Page 48)  Ms. RavenWolf proves, without a shadow of doubt, that she does not in fact respect other people's religious symbols or theology. Especially Christian theology:  "We have left (hopefully) the medieval times of tickling our brows with a feather quill and salivating over how many names we can create for legions of fallen angels." (Page 20)  *Sigh*... This woman is a best-selling author of alternative books, widely read, especially by a teen-aged audience. What sort of morals is she trying to convey to the new generation of pagans? Does she really think that none of her readers will be able to spot her flaming hypocrisy or the awe-inspiring lameness of her neurotic theories?  So okay, the Christians are supposedly a bunch of "salivating," manipulating thieves, but don't worry. The world will be safe. After all, the special, chosen Children of Gaia are here to save the day. Listen to this:  "Before you came to the Earth plane, you were the center of attention. There was a big conference about you. (...) You see, the Universe knows you are a very special person. You are a part of that small group of people who decide to go beyond the material realm and seek to manifest spiritual light, love and laughter on the physical plane through the gift of Magick. This requires a very special guardian angel indeed." (Page 110)  So because we choose to work with our spirituality, we are worth a lot more than, say, a gardener or a police officer? I just want to hurl myself into moving traffic when I hear this kind of self-rightous, Holier-Than-Thou-attitude, especially from a self-proclaimed open-minded child of the Goddess...  Ms. RavenWolf has a special message to all of you out there who don't feel particularly attracted to her personal brand of "angel magick":  "Every time I see a magickal person who throws a tantrum because I believe in angels and work with them, I see a spoiled little magician who won't go beyond the realm of possibility and I sadly know this person will never become a true adept." (Page 111)  Ouch. Guess I'd better just give up on this whole spirituality thing, huh? Either that or fall in line with this astounding woman. And this coming from a woman who thinks that powerful, advanced angel magick is making angel pillows, angel egg charms, angel "wanted ads" and angel felt banners...  So flimsy and bubbly, and yet so bitterly hateful. No wonder she doesn't publish any of this under her real name 
 Before making a decision on whether or not to purchase this book, I feel I should share some important information about its author, one Mark Kram, so that you can make an informed decision on whether this is the kind of honest man who is going to write a fair and even handed account on anything regarding boxing:  In 1976 Don King arranged the infamous US Championships Tournament for ABC television. This was a tournament involving fighters signed with Don King or his cohorts only. Bribery was used to corrupt ratings to justify the inclusion of undeserving King fighters/exclusion or far more deserving non-King fighters. The more worthwhile fighters who wanted to participate were told they would have to kickback a chunk of their purses to King, whilst also leaving their current manager and signing with King. Those who refused this blackmail were left excluded. And thus a bogus tournament was created with a clutch of retired preliminary fighters and obscure journeymen, dressed up as contenders with fake records and paid for rankings.  Where was Mark Kram in all of this? This `journalist' accepted gifts and gratuities from Don King and penned a puff piece article promoting the tournament for the January 1977 Sports Illustrated. Oh yes, ladies and gentlemen, this `journalist' was bought and wrote a four page article extolling the virtues of this "great tournament" and "the honesty of Don King"! Of course the tournament fell apart half way through and its massive corruption was exposed, as well as Kram's. This `journalist' took money under the table to humiliate the most respected sports publication in the US. No surprises the magazine fired Kram and had to write a full expose/apology by Robert Boyle in the May 1977 Sports Illustrated, atoning for Kram's article of lies.   And now all these years Kram resurfaces from under his rock, attempting to destroy the character of Muhammad Ali. Perhaps a look in the mirror may have been more appropriate. Muhammad Ali is loved by millions worldwide, and accorded major respected by fighters, both amateur and professional. Mark Kram however, is an exposed crook and isn't even accorded respect by fellow journalists, let alone fighters. Maybe if Kram had ever had the guts to lace on a pair of gloves he would have more of an understanding of just how hard it is to do what Muhammad Ali does 
 After reading this book it became obvious to me that the author has many unresolved issues with her religious life and with Christianity.  Even though she sheds some insight about whom or what MM was, she did so in a negative and sometimes condescending  way.    I was somewhat hurt by the character assignation she did on JC.  Obviously, she had made Jesus an idol of worship instead of the holy man he was and therefore took it upon herself to shatter that idol in this book.  The very thing she blames the Church in doing - making Jesus an idol - she has done herself.  The Jesus she spoke of in this book is not the Jesus I have come to know and love.  It is very easy to take words out of context and use them in a way to indicate hostility when in effect no hostility was meant.  It is easy to come to false conclusions and premises when one's perception is skewed by one's personal beliefs and emotions.  Jesus was human, but that does not take away from the divination of his being.  If Jesus was so humanly perfect then it would conclude that none of us could ever walk in his footsteps.  None of us would have a chance of experiencing heaven. That is ludicrous. 
 I have been a witch over 13 years and I am a big fan of Charles Leland. This book I am not. It has very little truth to it. Mr. Leland got the text from someone who wanted to abuse the craft with lies. This is a Christian book. That is put in a way to please the church. Witches do not belive in satan, though to this book. The horned god is satan himself. Aradia is said to make comments that would have gotten her killed on the spot. I NEVER threaten the goddess. Again we have many areas saying we do this. There is not enough room to go through it all. You can get free copies from websites all over if you must read it. If you do think about what it is saying and you can easy see it for what it is. A preverted vesion of what should of been sacred 
 This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up 
 Too juvenile for adults, and not likely that children would really enjoy it 
 I was quite disappointed with this one.  First of all the book's ending is very grim.  I agree with another reviewer when they said they'd rather be left imagining what kind of messes Arthur and Ford were getting themselves into now.  And so many unanswered questions!  What happened to Fenchurch and why didn't Arthur care more about what happened to her?  What happened to Zaphod?  Colin the robot?  What is the question to the answer 42?  What was Fenchurch's idea that would solve the world's problems?  What was the point to the people on Rupert?  It's worth reading just to be able to finish off the series and because it's still well written and funny just like the others.  But be prepared to be disappointed by the loose ends and finale.  
 I have read most of the books by Ambrose and the material in The Victors is covered better in his other works.  It isn;t bad, but the only reader who might find it interesting is someone who was looking to get into Ambrose's WWII works.  Anyone else but the completists will probably not enjoy this book 
 I wasn't impressed with this book. It seemed to be written from a denominational view. It wasn't just telling what the scripture says but had too much personal opinion. I wouldn't buy from the author again 
 This book was a very interesting book but for me it was extremely long.  I had a lot of work to do and therefore it took me a very long time to read.  I can see why some people may like this story but it has too many sub plots and too many pages.  If you have a long time to read a story and you have a thing for Russian history or war in general than you will probably enjoy this story.  It is one book that should probably read before you die but don't read it in high school.  Just a suggestion 
 Anita Shreve is pushing an agenda, but not necessarily a moral one.  Yes, Fortune Rocks contains many truthes...teenaged mothers shouldn't be ostracized from society, and are still people worthy of love, but ultimately the book tries to make adultery acceptable.  This book depressed me.  Not only because Shreve never admits that most of the suffering could've been averted by different (and wiser) choices, but because her amoral thinking is cleverly couched between truthes and half-truthes.  I also hate reading books that make hot, infatuation sex the highest possible endeavor in life, and that all else (especially a good marriage and children) should be sacrificed for it. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 This movie has a good plot, great acting, and potrays a very convincing relationship between a hardened young man and a girl whose combonation of strength and purity touches his heart and redirects the course of his life. I did like that they seemed to really know and understand each other, but was dissapointed in the sexual inuendos, the profanity, the undermining of parental authority, and the lack of closure concerning Landon's journey to faith. It is evedent that this movie is directed to a less-than-mature-audience. I saw more bad in it than good, which is sad since it could have been such an outstanding movie 
 This is a very informative book and I will probably use it as a strong reference in years to come.  It is not, however, a very easily read textbook.  Some areas are repetative and make for very slow reading.  Many times the author backs up her explanations citing studies. This is excellent in a reference book, however, as an introduction to an area of OT, it makes learning the subject matter laborious 
 I was very excited about this product when I ordered it, unfourtunatly the product didn't meet my expetations. It is extreamly slow, much slower than a George Foreman which really surprised me. Also, as another reviewer wrote it is very messy, I never appreciated the design of a foreman until I used this, the sides of the Cuisinart do not extend past the cooking surface much so they don't block any spray and when you open the griddler any condensation or food residue can slide off the back onto your counter because of where it is hinged.   In conclusion get a foreman 
 This book is written by a Red Sox "fan" who seems to hate all the players on the team. His colums are racist, pessimistic and negative. It's upsetting that people from around the world think actual Red Sox fans are like this. We're not, and outpouring of happiness in this city since our Foulke flipped to Meintkiewicz proves this. Shut up, Dan. No one wants to hear your tired rhetoric 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 If anyone realizes that if Koreans in North Korea at the time before the Russians came that if you were Korean in North Korea that you needed to speak Japanese or you would be extremely Punished.   
 Having just read the John Hammond bio that I purchased at the same time, I was not as impressed with this book. Even though I am familiar with many of the artists, it just didn't hold my interest that well. The author did seem to know his material, though. I just saw Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young again this summer. I wonder how they feel about each other now with so much gone on in decades before! It's a wonder more of these people didn't die of drug overdoses or std's! If you want an uplifting experience, this isn't for you 
 Well, it appears I'm one of the only ones to dislike this book, and it's by my favorite author, too!  The only good part about it was that it starred my two favorite people *ahem* characters, Tony Hill and Carol Jordon. There is no real mystery, as the killer is revealed immediately. Despite the opinions' of others I didn't find the book particularly scary, either.   The best part of this novel was when it was over, so that I could start The Last Temptation, the third, and, in my opinion, most amazing, Tony Hill/Carol Jordon novel 
 This book is really basic.  I found that "How to Make Big Money Mowing Small Lawns" as a better resource.  It had easy to understand charts. Simplistic pricing method. Simple to understand and extremely helpful/useful in earning extra income. This book offers unique and insightful ideas to help get you off the ground. It gives real life experience of the author will enable them to have insight into business that is fundamental to becoming entrepreneurial.  An updated version is available at librarydepot.co 
 yo, this album is hella weak. mac dre put some old rich the factor on it from over 3 years ago. i dont know whats up with this fool. he used to be sicc.  lat 
 I ordered about 10 of these boxes to place family photos in. I obviously could have continued to store them in the cardboard boxes they were in, but I wanted something better for treasured items. I did receive them promptly, but the box they were shipped in was not packed properly and all of the boxes were damaged. That I could live with, but one of the boxes had obviously been sitting for a long time in some warehouse because it had mold on the inside and the two metal rivets inside were rusted. The inside of this box smelled like an old musty basement. I emailed my complaint and stated I would like some type of adjustment because of the condition. That was over a week ago and no response. Since then I see the local Menards store has them on sale for $2 each when you buy two at a time. I won't be buying anything from this vender again. Problems occur, and not everything can be perfect, but what makes all the difference is SERVICE, and with this vendor, I've gotten none 
 I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS 
 From the tone of Dr. Seger's book on web-thinking, one comes away with the humorous impression that she believes she personally invented the entire concept of networking.  What could have been a helpful text is written instead as a look-at-everything-I've-done account that falls short of enlightening or inspiring women professionals who are serious about making the right connections in the film industry or anywhere else. Much of this, unfortunately, is due to a voice that borders on condescension and implies her readers wouldn't recognize common sense if it jumped up and bit them.  This was a disappointment in light of her prior releases regarding women in the movie biz.  By comparison, there are just better business-oriented resources available out there if networking is something that readers want to hone in order to advance in their professions.  It is also essentially a rehash of some of her earlier books which were more persuasive and practical in their focus.  I came away from this one wondering what the point of all of it was 
 Sure all the movies on there are great, and wow what a chance to get them all, but come on, this is absolutely sickening. The ultimate gift for the movie buff? With the list price of 4 grand, and the Amazon price at a grand and a half, it'd be cheaper to slap the movie buff who puts this on his xmas list. Seriously, there's no way anyone who buys this can say the economy's bad if they've got 1.5 thousand dollars to blow on something so meaningless. I'm for splitting that package up into about 4 or 5 sets, lower the price and viola! You're not a glutton for buying one of them at a time. Perhaps I'm the only one in this consumer day and age who doesn't find this to be a deal of the century, but rather one of the sickest displays of commercialism I've seen 
 I agree with one of the reviewers who pointed out the anti-social nature of the author. I also agree that the author's self "selling points" are simply a modern copy of the "emperor's new clothes".   I noticed that majority of the posters claimed that this "master's text" is incomprehensible. As a matter of fact, I believe that the entire book are just the psychotic rambling. So why bother even to read it!?  
 Nicholl manages to give a good view of the personality of Leonardo da Vinci, by describing what is known about da Vinci's childhood and then proceeding to describe his career as a *painter* in chronological order. Although in describing character Nicholl occasionally falls in depth into Freudian mumbojumbo, he has to be complemented that he does recognize that it is only fantastical speculation. The style of Nicholl is enjoyable and easy to read. If you want to a good description of da Vinci the painter and his career, then this is the book for you. Nicholl goes in detail to the creation of many paintings of da Vinci, both those well known to general public and those less well known.   However, if you want a biography of da Vinci the multitalented man, then this book is definitely not for you. More space is given for description of a single art project that never came to be than is given to all the inventions and scientific contributions of da Vinci. As an example, Nicholl mentions that in the field of anatomy da Vinci's original contribution was greatest, and then proceeds to give six pages and two illustrations on the topic. And, unfortunately, most of these six pages is on the usefulness of the study of anatomy to a painter. More room is given to speculations about the possible identity of a female model in a painting lost hundreds of years ago than is given to the actual contribution of da Vinci to the field of anatomy. There is no description of the state of anatomical knowledge at the time and no description of how Leonardo added to this knowledge. If you did not know anything about da Vinci before reading this book, you would finish with the impression that he was a mere painter and sculptor who did little if anything else - except dreamt of flying because of some Freudian type of childhood problem. Admittedly, paintings are perhaps the most lasting contribution of da Vinci, but they are not the reason why his figure appears in comics and novels, e.g. in Pratchett's Discworld books in disguise of Leonard da Quirm. If the painting part was cut by 50 % and replaced by more detailed description of his other activities, this could be a very good book. At present, if gets more and more annoying as when you approach the end you slowly realise Nicholl is never going discuss anything else than works of art and artist viewpoint 
 I generally like Elmore Leonard, this is the twelfth book of his I've read, ranging from his Detroit crime capers, to his L.A.-set Chili Palmer stuff, to some of his Westerns. Other than the terrible "Be Cool", this is probably my least favorite of his books so far. Set in the years between the end of World War I and 1934, the story follows Carlos "Carl" Webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot U.S. Marshall. The story takes place in the dusty Midwest, mainly around Tulsa and Oklahoma City, as Carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves.  Carl is a somewhat vain, cocky lawman, with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers. His main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man, a no account young man who has everything he needs, but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into Carl's path. Mixed into this are kinds of period details, from prohibition to Will Rogers shows to Klansmen vigilantes to "True Detective" writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, and Bonnie and Clyde Barrow.   Despite all this background detail, the story itself failed to engage me. There are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize Leonard's best work. There's a good guy, a bad guy, and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic. In fact, about halfway through the book I realized that the "real story" wasn't going to kick in -- I was in it! And unlike many Leonard books, the supporting cast of characters isn't particularly memorable. Even Leonard's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing, subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech. Ultimately, one gets the feeling that Leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period, and perhaps didn't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story. That said, the Depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story, given the time and place. All in all, unless you're really really into the whole '30s gangster thing, not worth the time. 
 very similar to an officer and a gentlemen, but no passion, and this is a lousy movie.  the DVD will be in the $1 bin by the new year.  
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 I was really excited to get this book, but so far I have had no success with the recipes.  The things I have made just don't taste very good at all.  The nutritional yeast taste is strong, and I like nutritional yeast, even when I reduce the amounts in the recipe.  The taste is definitely not cheese like in anything I have tried.  I was hoping for this book to help me to get over the hump and give up dairy cheese for good, but the results have been very poor so far 
 This was my first Sidney Sheldon and surely it will be my last. I only picked up this audio book, because I wanted some mindless entertainment on my long drive down to LA from SF...and it was one of the few audio books at my local library...anyways, the premise was interesting. But the twists and turns were just preposterous, unbelievable.  I found myself laughing at the characters' predicaments. The dialogue was inauthentic and made me wonder, 'who would say such a thing in a real conversation?'. Perhaps it was the bad actress who read the book?  I wonder how Sheldon became so famous with this kind of pedestrian writing. Thank goodness I didn't purchase this book. For this genre, I much prefer Dean Koontz, John Sanford, and even Mary Higgins Clark.   
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 Bought this on a clearance rack and can now see why it hadn't sold.  The characters were unexciting, and the story dragged on and on.  I read 4 books while having this one unfinished on my night stand.  I've never read any of Allison's other novels, but after reading this one, I don't think I'll jump on the chance.  Dede was the most interesting character, and even she couldn't keep me involved.   
 I read and studied this book," Official (ISC)2 Guide to the CISSP Exam", for my one study aid in quick preparation for the CISSP exam. I found the book's coverage of topics and the common body of knowledge to be fine; indeed the book is tuned to the CISSP exam's intended scope rather well. The problem with this book is quality control and the details. Just to get it out of the way, what annoyed me the most is that many of the sample "exam questions" are flawed lacking quality control. Not flawed like the CISSP exam questions themselves are known to be, but simply poorly written. The answer section for the sample questions has many flaws and mistakes: such as mixing up answers for other chapters' questions, unfinished text, etc. A frustrating way to end each chapter.  The main body of the book suffers from major reuse of subject matter, and at times contradictions on subjects. A whole-book editorial review is needed to tighten the thing up -- it suffers from a high-level sloppiness that makes reading and studying more tiring than necessary. Lastly, in some subject areas the book is inaccurate and/or out of date. As it stands, do not use this book as a security-subject expert-reference. Too many little mistakes of omission and half-correct contexts, and at times too little detail to give a subject "enough" coverage to put the important issues in the right light 
 Beware, that this DVD does not have English audio track despite its Amazon description. This is an outstanding movie, but Amazon has wrong data and issued a full refund for me 
 This book is a good start for someone that has no idea what to do to take care of their muscles and joints.  As a martial artist, active in the gym (weights) and a therapeutic massage therapist, I found this book to be a waste of time.  On the positive side, it is a quick read and I have reinforced, by second oppinion (the book), that I know more about taking care of myself than the average bear.  In purchasing this book, I was hoping to find something that I didn't already know or something that I didn't think was common sense.  If you have never played sports, never taken care of your body (stretching, contrast therapies, proper posture) then this book is for you 
 My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.   The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.  That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.   And  no, I do not believe there was any such child. 
 I received this book on audio cassette as a gift.  Apparantely I am in the minority but I found this book very difficult to follow without becoming distracted.  I felt like it was written for the psychology profession instead of the general population.  It was repetative and lacked intrigue which made it difficult to keep listening 
 This book is embarassing.  Even worse than Icons of Evolution.  What he presents as science is mostly a mix of ignorance and outright lies.  There are many sites by real scientists which expose Wells' errors and fabrications step by step (Panda's Thumb is a good one.) Anybody who is unfamiliar with the actual scientific literature on evolution would be well advised to visit one of those sites and at least begin the process of self education.  If you do, you will quickly see how unreliable Wells is as a science writer 
 Be aware that this book was labeled as 'trash' by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, and that the Food and Drug Administration issued a paper claiming the author destorts his facts.  The book supports and suggests a chain of clinics called 'HealthMed', which are run by Scientologists.  Make up your own mind 
 The advertisement for a $30 credit is deceiving, don't fall for it 
 Jesus, what a narcassist, I mean is this guy for real.  Why do people buy into this idiot with the ridiculous comb over; the emperor has no clothes, people!  The only reason he has any money is because the banks could not afford to call in his notes, he had such staggering debt, he would have sunk the bank..id love to know what his net worth really is..but you have to give the guy credit he does know how to get press, and his spawn seen to be a chip off the old comb over, they are as arrogant and frankly unattractive as he is, though i must admit his new child is a really cute kid...maybe a paternity test is in order.  How to get rich...drive up ur debt to such a level, and owe so many creditors that they cannot afford to call in your debt..priceless 
 I've been around a bit, and have NEVER encountered ANYBODY who communicates the way this book advocates.  Most people would laugh you off the block if you started interacting with them the way Bolton suggests, and it's extremely nieve to think that people will accept you as he suggests they will.   What people need is a communications book for surviving REALITY,  as it is now, not for how it should be

 I echo the comments of the previous reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!  The book states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic Church before driving himself to another church.  This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant.  In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is misspelled "Asnevin".  The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!  And this is just chapter one!    I have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing.  I would suggest skipping this one and purchasing Bono: In Conversation With Michka Assayas, which includes a pretty good account of Bono's life from the man himself.  
 Although the spark of creativity is there, it still takes some time to appreciated this novel after reading Janes Eyre.  The main character Crimsworth seems to be arrogance, aristocratic, and audacious.  This could be Bronte's first take on a male perspective, but is that what she considered the male psyche to be as she portrays on her other novels' male characters.  All in all the novel has some worth, but needs getting used to 
 I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust 
 Another unspeakable album from the most unspeakably overwrought, over-produced and over-rated rock band of all time.  Did I mention over the top? Let's face it, Queen was a group of crypto-fascists, working hard to put a human face on Thatcherism.  Ghastly stuff.  K. 
 Judging from the titles, the book should instruct how to make your own faux chicken, beef, and pork.  This is not the case.  All of the recipes call for prepackaged meat substitutes.  Personally, I don't want to have to rely on a grocer's, Whole Foods included, poor selection of soy products.  Almost everyone out there can figure out how to make traditional recipes vegetarian using meat substitutes.  If you are new to the veg lifestyle, and have never cooked a meal in your life, this book might be somewhat useful; otherwise it's not worth it 
 Mr. Shirley, how can 1965's "Here, There, and Everywhere" have been influenced by 1966's Pet Sounds 
 I've read a couple other books by Bill's books and always loved them.  Great characters, great story line, involved and wonderful.  This book was missing all of that - and then some.  The main characters are SO uninteresting that I had a hard time continuing to read.  I could have cared less if the old billionaire lived or died.  Does the married eco-freak couple actually keep the baby ... WHO CARES.    The story revolves around organ transplants, the drive of an old wealthy man to procreate and cure himself, a couple fighting for the rights of the environment, a third world organ thief of a doctor, and a crazy orphan who sells himself for a living.  Yes it has promise.  No - the story line does not deliver.  Please don't buy this book.  You'll only be disappointed 
 This book is from 1987, I briefly read the reviews saying that it wasn't in the digital era, OK I figured that's fine, how out of date could it be? However, I didn't expect that so much of the book would be dedicated to functionality that's now fully automatic, such as TTL Flash, and TTL exposure metering.   It's certainly a very interesting technical read, that provided me with an understanding of all the different macro options, lenses, filters, extensions, TC's, reversing rings, bellows, reverse mount adapters, lens stacking, etc. However, it wasn't for me.   I was after something that would show technique, or provide advice on how/where to find the shots he was taking, but the book doesn't cover that at all, to my dismay the book starts with the author writing "it always surprises me that folks find it hard to find subjects" but then provides no advice. After having bought a 60mm Micro lens I was hopeful this would provide direction, but other than "I probably should have bought the 105mm lens" I didn't get any direction from it.   
 Well,this dvd was ok...tghey could of used better camras for the night scenes this dvd did have the punch of the 360 videos or any othere street racing movie..i think i could of made one better this dvd seems like they did it with a computer but did know wat they where doing...So i gave it 2 stars for lack of punch i prefer 360 VIDEOS LIKE TIMELAPSE HARD DRIVE AND OTHER VIDEOS LIKE ON THE SCEEN 1,2 AND STREET FURY SO DONT BUY THIS VIDEO IF U WAN TTO GO AHEAD BUT THE DISC SCRACTHED EASY OLNY HAD IT FOR A DAY AND THE DISC DIDNT WORK! 
 Normally I wouldn't waste my time... Normally I would write a "real" view. but.... I hate this band... time and time again I buy the album thinking "maybe just maybe" and everytime... I am dissapointed they suck more and more... They are barly in the rock genre... they cry almost enough to be cosidered childrens music... I hate them... Don't buy it... DON"T DO IT 
 I dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap-opera like compulsion, always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our Lord.  Therefore, I anticipated this final novel to be glorious, as the title indicates, but I was woefully wrong.  Are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming King and His Kingdom?  Certainly not!    I support Christian fiction with many 5 star reviews,--just look at my other reviews--but I can not recommend this series 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 Over the last couple of years, I've read a number of Harvard MBA-type books on marketing and strategy, and I have to say this was the least useful, by far.  Generally, I read and tip the pages that require followup in my own work--inject that sensibility into a marketing piece; develop a new piece that addresses x; develop an ongoing relationship with y consituency; etc.    I loved Trading Up and found it profoundly useful in my business.  Likewise Blue Ocean Strategy.  Others do great work emphasizing the key role women are playing in today's economy.  Lots of tipped pages; lots of followup; lots of big benefits.  This book has its breakthrough point, which I appreciate.  I shop at Costco and resale shops but don't need to, and my behavior is patterned on that of my mother.  I splurge or trade up with my savings.  And, as the book points out, this behavior is extremely prevalent among the upper income band.  It's a lifestyle, not a poverty avoidance strategy--that's the point.    But jeez, Silverstein thanks literally 100 people at the end of the book (yes I read every page), and it reads like it.  The cases don't link up with the text.  Vaguely interesting stuff (e.g. material apparently trying to make the point that these trends are visible in Europe--a marketing ploy to sell books overseas?) are dropped into Chapter 2 and then fade away.  You meet people; you meet companies.  Some stories hang together and seem to have a purpose and some don't.  And then you read the same sentence twice within a couple paragraphs.  Earth to Butman--"their inner spirits first and their outer beauty second."  I sense that BCG decided they had a bunch of goodwill with a limited shelf life out there from the first book.  "Let's pull a bunch of staffers together, crank for a couple of weeks, and see what we come up with."  My advice:  Go to the library, take 8 minutes to read the cogent first chapter, and then "trade up" with the financial and time savings by buying five friends great lattes at the closest Peets.    --Kennedy School Grad with No Tipped Pages Tonigh 
 I've read hundreds of martial arts books over the last 30+ years I've been a practitioner and maintain a library of about 240 of them. It's not often that I come across one that I truly detest but unfortunately this is one of that select group. The truly sad part is that it has much potential. After all, it is written by one of the world's foremost experts on the subject. Okay, here is why I don't think it's worth the paper it is written on:  First off, it is in reality a puff piece, a 20-page book masquerading as a 208 page one. Less than one third of the work actually has any data that you can learn anything from. The rest is superfluous pictures that are only tangentially related to the text, historical illustrations, and a copy of the original text in Japanese (which is neat if you can actually read it I suppose). Most of the photos are intentionally blurred to show movement. One or two like that is kinda cool but in this case it is way, way over done. They are hard to look at and literally gave me a headache by the time I got done. And they have very little to do with explaining what is going on or how to do the techniques. The text is also poorly written (or perhaps merely inelegantly translated) and hard to follow.  If you are looking for an interesting coffee table tome with some artsy pictures go ahead and pick this up. If you want a serious martial arts learning tool get something (nearly anything) else. Hugely disappointing!  Lawrence Kane Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instructio 
 I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one. 
 The idea of this book is a great one. There is allot of good information. The problem is that the author puts his own personal opinions in it. It ruins it. After reading it, it sounded like the author had a personal  vendatta against roger moore. The author comes across very bitter and ruins  the great idea of the book. The author should have kept his opinions to  himself. Forget this one. there are plenty of really good books about bond  out there 
 I like several songs on Kasabian's old album but there were also many poor ones. Still on this album I dont know if i could say that there are any songs better than Club Foot, Reason Is Treason, and Processed Beats.  It seems Kasabian has gone psychedelic and also run out of ideas in the process, there is nothing special or creative on this album 
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
 I was disappointed in this book because I expected any book that is exclusively devoted to exterior house color and paint to have info that is not readily available for free on any paint and/or home improvement site for free.  It did have nice photos, but few examples of each home style.  Many of the color combos will be "dated" in just a few years too 
 Maybe it's my own fault, but I didn't get that from the product description.  It's a weensy little thing for using on your desk at work or taking with you on business trips; in my apartment it barely lasts through one night.  It's also really noisy.  I am probably comparing to my last (normal sized) humidifier ( a vicks something or other, no longer available) which was great and lasted 3 years, until hard water built up too much limescale... I would have cleaned more if I'd have realized how hard it is to find one to replace it 
 I would rate this piece of film trash a "0", but unfortunately, that is not an available option. This stupid movie did not start the scene, but it did contribute to it. This review is to all of you ghetto monkey morons who think that because you have ground effects and an obnoxious sounding muffler, that somehow you have transformed yourselves into Mario Andretti and a Ferrari; I have some astounding news for you, the average citizen thinks you are an idiot with a license, and should be barred from ever contributing to the human populus. No one is impressed with your driving antics that endanger the rest of us on the roads and highways. In fact, everytime I read that one of you idiots died in a tragic accident due to your own ignorance and lack of driving skills, I actually celebrate with my friends, and we relieve ourselves on the grave, because there is one less stupid person on the road. Do the rest of the world a favor, save your money, don't make your car look stupid and ghetto, which in return, makes you look stupid and ghetto,learn how to drive safely, turn your hat around (facing forward), pick up your retarded looking baggy pants, put a belt on, and hide your underwear, (that no one wants to see, but laughs at you while you walk past) and speak a normal language that includes words besides "dawg" and other non-understandable neanderthal sounds that clearly indicate your lack of education and stupidity 
 This was a waste of my money. Picked it up at the airport and thought it would be a fun, light read but it was boring and not funny at all. I left it unread in the plane

 I was very excited to see another Valentine horror movie coming out; the last one I remember was My Bloody Valentine about some Cole Minor named Harry Nabob or something like that, very bad film.  But Valentine looked like it would be good and it was actually until the ending.   The pretty boy being the killer again is just played out.  Scream was good everything else is just redundant.  Imagine if the geeky boy who was attacked by the bullies actually got burned or his face was horribly deformed in a fall or something like that.  He goes to the mental institution and years later he escapes or is released into society, but escaped is much better.  This masked figure then chases down the mean kids and kills them one by one, then the climax when we see his face it shows the reason he is so angry and deranged.   I give it 2 stars because it could have been so good and I can always pretend the ending was good 
  I'm not sure what happened, but this project could be so much better than it is. It sounds like a rush job ( kinda like Destiny Fulfilled). I expected with their voices to hear soaring leads and tight harmonies on a more traditional slant, but still have their DC3 flavor. Boy, was I ever wrong. A lot of these songs are over the top and so far removed from the traditional versions that I don't really know what they are talking about. It is very commercial and materialist in content. It isn't really about the real spirit of Christmas at all. I used Little Drummer Boy in a Christmas play at church with a trio of youth singers and it was so incorrect with regard to content that I had to edit the song... the little drummer boy played for the Baby Jesus,  not the girls playing for the little drummer boy ( that is apparent when Beyonce says, ("...then he smiled at me, little drummer boy smilled at me.") Did she ever listen to the original song? It just doesn't measure up.  The first track...well, all the materialistic things she gets for Christmas just says it all. I really dislike that song and it completely missed the point... where are the other days? Guess she got it all in the first 4 days or so...  I just think they missed it big time on this.  Their attempt was weak at best and this project doesn't really showcase their true abilities nor capture the spirit of the Christmas season 
 ropes are cheap,and while strong,make the swing sit at an angle and swing not straight, but in an eliptical figure eight pattern 
 It's a good book, but it is easily broken. So my 2 year old, never gets to read it, because I am always having to glue it back together 
 Ok so I have always thought Courteney Cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it. It really is the most boring show Ive seen in a long time. If you thought she was bad in scream...and friends..dont watch this...there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it. Hopefully this show will be scraped 
 I would not buy this version of the old classic for very young children.  In this version two of the pigs get eaten by the wolf, and the wolf gets eaten in the end by the last pig. When the pigs ask for the materials to  build their houses, they do not offer to pay, trade or work for the straw,  sticks or bricks, they are given the materials. What kind of message does  that give our youth 
 Israeli Historian Ilan Pappe is part of a new movement in Israel, known as the "Revisionists", whose goal is to portray what Pappe refers to as a "dezionised" view of history. This means that by taking out the ideological element of Zionism from our approach to history, we can gain a more accurate view of what really happened. But how does this new method hold up? In this particular case, it does not do well. For example, Pappe claims that Israel had planned to drive out the Palestinians from Israel under Plan D and the fact that they did not get to do so, since most fled beforehand, does not change the fact that Israel still planned to do so. But Plan D was carried out under orders for "the coexistence on the basis of mutual freedom and dignity." (Karsh p, 89), and few Arabs were actuall driven out. Pappe also claims that Israel won the war since it was a fight between a well-organized modern society and a traditional one lacking cohesion. The Arabs were better equipped and organized than Pappe claims, however, as well larger in numbers. The Palestinians had help from the surrounding states, and he does not mention the importance of willpower. The Jews stood their ground, while the Arabs did not. Perhaps the only part that convinces is his handling of the UNSCOP commission. Overall, however, this book reads as little more than diatribe against the Jewish state than an objective history 
 banal, derivative, overproduced tripe.  whiney, lame, stupid vox/lyrics. a country-inflected KILLERS--i.e. soul-less corporate rock gone trendy (read "alt-country" wannabes with My Bloody Valentine fantasies).

 What a bore. truelly watching paint dry is of more interest then this self inflated bore 
 While Hirsch does a good job of listing most of the trends in public school education, he does a truly dismal job of explaining why they don't work. In fact, even though I lean towards more traditional learning, I thought he was so off base with his reasons as to *why* this or that educational technique doesn't work, that actually I found I agreed in several cases with his opponents, which I don't think was the aim of his book, lol.  For example, he doesn't like project-based learning, or cooperative (small group) education. He feels they're inefficient. Well, they're not inefficient if done correctly, where each student is assigned an equally difficult and important task, and the teacher keeps on top of things, individually grading each student independently of the project, and the students in the group are similar in terms of intelligence, skill, and work ethic.   However, what *really* happens, and why they don't work (which he does not mention) is that most teachers use these techniques during class as babysitting devices so they can grade papers or do other paperwork or go on break. The smarter and/or harder working students, because they don't want their grades to suffer, end up doing all of the work and the slackers skate by with a good grade because the teacher only grades the total project. The smarter students also wind up actually teaching the other students for a good deal of the school day, which gee, I thought that was what TEACHERS are paid to do.   He even fails to list that the best reason to continue with the "traditional" classroom where teacher talks and students listen is that it is often the most efficient way to get information across to large groups of people. How could he miss that?    He mentions that in Asian classrooms students are typically given an overview of exactly what they will learn in a class session. Well, go to any seminar and probably 95% of them are taught that way, because you have really large groups of people and only one instructor. Most lower-division college classes (especially those held in large auditoriums) are taught this way.   However, these classes only work if students are well-behaved (often not the case in K-12) and everyone in the class is assumed to have the ability to learn the new information with little or no follow-up (which again is often not the case in K-12). In these types of classes, the teacher (or indeed, anyone who can read the lesson plan) simply presents the information, which is hardly "teaching", by any stretch of the imagination.   The chief value in this book lies primarily in the glossary, which provides a wealth of buzzwords for the homeschooling parent to jazz up any district-required homeschool record-keeping 
 Instead, it should be flung to the ground with great force. Acker is nothing more than a paedophile, a dirty old toothless man trapped in a woman's body. Comprehensively awful. Had a man written this, he would have been lynched instantly. Avoid at all costs 
 For me, the performance simply missed the mark. A capable choir should be able to stand forth and sing out without a surround of distracting instrumentation. Though the poor have already suffered enough, I promptly gave my copy of this CD to charity. For that I beg forgiveness 
 On of the worst i've heard, there were very few good tracks (Falls On Me, I Hate, It's My Life, and Sunrise). The setup was also wrong, for It's My Life should have been after I Hate  and before Feeling This 
 Another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation... If you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...Unfortunately they don't come with disclaimers. like one would get when reading a book on the occult... People tend to go for books that support their bigoted view, and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it.... It is a living. When the Da Vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot's guide to the code, how to interpret the code etc etc.... I am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the NY times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad... 
  I loved '' careless love`` and saw Madeleine live here in Rio de Janeiro in a reasonably good show.I am quite disappointed with this album however because I had great expectations.Let's face it folks, however smoky and billiesque her voice is she is never going to have the power and the range of the original.She needs to be really close miked and well recorded to get that voice to sound right.This is obvious from seeing her live.  So what were those marketing executives thinking by promoting a cd full of soft and slow ballad covers that are obviously going to turn a huge spotlight  on her  vocal delivery? Those songs need an Ella,a Sarah Vaughn,or even a Shirley Horn -to name some  giants- to have a chance of pulling it off with their huge range, timing and phrasing.  To compound the problem , the recording engineers/producers did not do a great job on her voice or the rest of the band for that matter.Everything is much too soft and distant (unlike careless love).If you want an atmospheric but still powerful sound you must produce something like the last Shirley Horn cds.  Last but not least the rest of the good band are not allowed to play anything remotely interesting but are relegated to  very minimalist backing chores.  I think there is a misconception with the record excecs that M.P. has the qualities to make her a modern  pop-jazz diva ala Diana Krall.She has to find her real voice and the correct material to match.Good luck.  
 Hateful liberals once again undermine their so-called ideology by promoting the hatred of over half the US population. They claim to be tolerant and open-minded toward all lifestyles,religions, races etc... but that open-mindedness obviously shouldn't apply to people who disagree with them. Throughout the "book," Moore also demonstrates his racism towards caucasians and thin people. If you like this book, I also recommend Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Both "books" are jam-packed full of hate. 
 Misleading pictures... the Holster is Triangular.. not Rectangular as the picture would suggest.. Also, it does not fit well with the RAZR phone... I'm afraid the phone will fall off any second if I use it... This one goes to the trash can.. 
 It is unfortunate to have to write such a review, but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that I am compelled to do so. The unit was received new, but the hinges were already rusted, the closure hasp broken (poorly designed and executed), the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp. Made in China, this stove demonstrates no attention to detail, quality control or materials.  I own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory, much less, off the design table.  Further, the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor, if not downright unacceptable (in major ways).  As this unit was new in the box, I can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the US manufacturer has for customers. Save yourself cut hands and returns, buy another brand 
 This phone system is now in a box where all my old and failed electronics go.  You could be 2 feet from the base and all handsets still sounded scratchy like an old cell phone.  I have a 2.4ghz and a 900mhz phone in the house and they work like a champ and have been where the Uniden base was....so its not the location.  If I could give this product a zero star I would!  
 I have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and I have become very skeptical of much of its advice.  This advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g. the US Dairy Industry (there is always at least one of those annoying "got milk" ads) and not surprisingly, every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products (e.g. milk and cheese).  However having read many books on nutrition, it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the The China Study by Colin Campbell, an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the US dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public's perception of the healthfulness of its products.  It is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers' paychecks.  The magazine also appears to be very similar to Prevention magazine which I also have subscribed to and I would make the same criticism of.  My advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent "Berkeley Wellness Letter" that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the US Dairy Industry 
 Newton has no concept of reality.  This collection is nothing but more feminist banter standing upon a foundation of pagan thought at a teenage comprehension level.  Whether you find yourself rooting with liberals or conservatives there is no level of scholarship to be found anywhere the truth has been subdued 
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
  I just finished reading Laurel K. Hamiliton's latest, `Danse Macabre'. I was very disappointed. The novel gave a good sense of her true strengths and weaknesses as a writer. She is good at talk, bad at plot; good at sex, bad at action; good at erotica, bad at depth and breadth of character. The `story', such as it is, goes: talk about relationships, fight with Richard, have sex, move to another room, talk about relationships, fight with someone else, have sex, move to nearby corridor, fight with Richard, have group sex...repeat, etc. One novel like that could be an accident or bad editing, two or three is a weakness in the writer. I admire her for starting a genre but she now just writes women's porn, and the problem with women's porn is that we're not really into i 
 The publishers should be sued. Maybe we should get a class-action together.  Imagine taking an instruction manual for the very first Apple computer and putting a new title on it "How to use your new home computer" and selling it in bookstores today. This book is doing EXACTLY that!  Also, it is highly doubtful that the tactic ever worked in the first place. The author's website vanished years ago. In a thinly traded NYSE stock if you try to repeatedly front the specialist with 2000 share orders he will simply move the price 50 cents against you immediately following your next purchase. Game over.  [... 
 This is a serious book on psychology,  not one of those "how to" popular books. To me it was very helpful, it helps to understand oneself better. I reccomend it warmly 
 Coghead (Brooklyn, NY): I understand how you feel, but we must understand that every artist must one: create his/her own style and two: they have to keep up with what is in style. Reggaeton is a new genre and in order to be competitive and have longivity in this business you can still stick to your style but you have to keep pace with what's in. I love La India and yes the cd could be better but her cd is up to date with what is being listened to. Maybe for her next album, Pure Salsa will be back in style. La India will always be the next female Celia 
 I didn't like this book.  It's about giving zero tolerance to children's rudeness.  The authors are convinced that there way is right.  It is authoritarian style parenting. It's supposed to be about logical consequences but the consequences are not logical just punishing. They don't recommend, they tell you what you must do. They say that not taking your child to a concert where people are relying on him to perform is how to deal with rudeness and teach him/her how to be respectful of other people!!!  Parent's need to see the bigger picture and deal with the situation which includes the child's rudeness and not focus solely on that.  
 I wore these slippers for about one week.  One morning while wearing them, my right foot felt like the material inside the shoe was twisted.  I looked down at the shoe to see what the problem was, and much to my surprise, part of my foot was hanging out the side of the slipper!  The seam had split where the top and side were stitched together.  Very disappointed 
 I have two 8" picture frames that are other brands, and they are GREAT and I use them for Open Houses all the time! I got this one as a gift from a friend, and it is terrible!! The instructions are difficult to understand. The wide screen makes everyone in the picture look FAT and distorted! This is a weird size and I am not happy at all!! I don't recommend it 
 I thought these muffins tasted like white rice bread which isn't very tasty.  I've made my own muffins mixing brown rice flour, tapioca flour, and potato starch flour and they are a million times better.  Won't buy these again.  I expected these to be as close to the real thing as the Glutino crackers are to regular crackers(not the tomato basil but the plain ones) but they weren't 
 This book is shockingly bad.  If you are a fan of Toole's work and life, this is not the place to get your info.  The majority of the work is neither footnoted nor substantiated in any way.  There are a tremendous amount of assumptions, speculations, and what appear to be outright fabrications, that would paint Toole to fit their convenient image.  Sadly, there is still a void where a true biography should be and this will only confuse things until then.  I would greatly recommend Ken & Thelma, or take a trip to New Orleans and study his letters personally 
 The subject of the book is interesting but the writing style is vague and very circumstantial. What can be said in one sentence is explained in one or several paragraphs and what can be explained in one paragraph is said in a chapter or more. You don't want to put some books down once you piced them up. This book is the opposite; you cannot wait to put it down. It is very boring to read.  
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 I have been delighted by other commenaries in the NIGTC series, and was eagerly anticipating Murray Harris' commentary on 2 Corinthians. After all, Harris is a very experienced teacher who had previously written a commentary on 2 Corinthians in 1976. Now with this completely new commentary I was looking forward to the fruit of Murray's lifetime of scholarship.  I was looking forward to fruit, but was served 962 pages of sawdust. It is difficult to describe how painfully boring this work is and I would have returned it if it wasn't an assigned text book for one of my classes.  Rather than providing crisply argued interpretations of Paul's letter, this commentary is just a pile of information and disjointed opinions. The reason I gave it 2 stars rather than none is simply because it contains so much information that it has some value to anyone who wants to devote several years to studying 2 Corinthians.  But if you are a pastor looking for a good commentary to help with a 4 month sermon series ... don't even consider this tomb as an option.  On top of how painful this text is to actually wade through, the editors should be ashamed of themselves for actually putting it into print. This text contains such useful features as an analysis of the Chiastic structure being presented in UNTRANSLATED Italian (p. 111).  This may be designed to show how well read Harris is - but is just annoying to the 99.9% of English speaking pastors who don't read Italian. The editors should have just said NO.   Unless you feel compelled to buy a dozen commentaries on 2 Corinthians, you should scratch this text off of your "wish list" 
 HEY!  NEVER LIKED JA FOOL! HE IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE OVER! WHERE IS HE??????? LIKE I CARE! ANY WAY!!!!  50 HAS SOLD 16 MILLION+ CD'S AND JA FOOL HAD THE NERVE TO SAY 50 DON'T SELL!! HA!!!!!! JA FOOL!!!  GREATEST HITS!!!!!!!!!! NUFF SAID!  OVER JA FOOL RULE!! 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 The book Teacup Full Of Roses had a few topics that teens today could relate to. Nevertheless, this was not a very enjoyable book to me . I didn't like it because of how short it was. I think it should have been longer to give more details. In my opinion, the prolouge didn't fit well with the ending of the book. Overall, I give the book a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I would not reccomend this book to anyone because it was lacking a few things, which made it confusing 
 This album sounds like stuff left over from their other CDs, stuff that didn't make the cut then. It doesn't now either. I'm not happy with this CD at all 
 I'm not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What's "fierce" about that?   The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko." What are we in "Happy Days?" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad. 
 I'm very disappointed because the word "Minature" is hidden in the parenthesis section after the title.  I didn't notice that when I ordered and do NOT want the miniature version 
 I enjoyed She Walks These Hills and was shocked to discover that this book  was written by the same author.  The plot was silly, the mystery was  uninteresting, and the characters were one-dimensional.  It read like a  draft for a course "Learning to Write Mystery Stories".  Ms.  McCrum should have kept this one in her botton drawer 
 Christopher Catherwood, a professor affiliated with Cambridge University's Institute of Continuing Education, has written this book on the modern history of what has come to be called Iraq.  Putting Churchill's name into  the title makes the book so much easier to market to those Americans who react to Churchill's name with the same giddiness that any mention of the Beatles once elicited from teenage girls.  To his credit, Catherwood has tried to cut through the fog of ideology and propaganda to get to the bottom of what happened.  Unfortunately, his undertaking wasn't even close to successful.  For example, Catherwood claims that the oil companies had no way of being sure that Iraq had oil deposits at the time that the Iraqi boundaries were drawn.  This despite the fact that crude oil had been seeping up to the surface in Iraq since biblical times, when, because it was deemed a medicine, had been brought by caravan to such distant places as China.  Natural gas also made its way to the surface, and would catch fire in eerie flames that the Iraqis attributed to ghosts.  These indisputable facts utterly refute the world according to Catherwood that this book has to offer..  Catherwood implies that the British were only interested in Iraq's oil because of its military use - one almost hears undertones insisting that the British only wanted a platonic relationship - but neglects to mention the close ties between Shell Oil and the admiral who fanatically urged advocated that the Royal Navy transition to oil.  These ties were so close that some of his colleagues were convinced that he had some financial stake in the deal.  I could write further paragraphs in this vein.  Were I ever to write a book on a subject so shrouded in disagreement as Iraq's history, I would make sure to first talk with knowledgeable people from the region, and then consult the writings of academics.  Unfortunately Catherwood seems to only have done the latter, to his colossal book's detriment.  Clio must feel slighted.  The only reason I don't give the book a single star, is that there are even worse books on the subject 
 Less than 3 pages of average information in a 300 page book.  Go figure 
 An arrogant, rich guy brags at length about snagging a trophy girlfriend (his client's daughter), then chuckles to himself as he motors his shiny BMW bike through crowds of "brown faces" (I think those were his actual words).  As a travelogue, this book fails because all of the locations and cultures blur together.  As a means of imparting financial strategy, this book also fails--for the reasons noted in other reviews.  Anything worthwhile the author has to say is completely nullified by his enormous ego, which comes across on every page.  For those of you seeking adventure writing or stock tips, look elsewher.  
 "In Good Company" goes on and on at the end a little bit, and the ending especially is not fulfilling character/plot-wise.  If it had ended 15-20 minutes before it actually did, I would give it three stars instead of two.  I admit there were quite a few times when I laughed a bit to myself, but it didn't make me fall off the couch or anything. There were other times when I thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced.  Overall it isn't an entirely bad movie, but, like I said, the ending is unfulfilling.  Overall not strong performances coming from Scarlett Johansson or Topher Grace 
 The origins of this book can be found in the fear. The author really believes that his country is the only one that really matters in the world... it's exactly what we could wait from a blind conservative like this. The only problem is that history continues.. 
 Clearly John Gardner is a literary genius, however not being one myself I found that his style was a little overbearing, it does not offer the inspired start to writing fiction that I was looking for.   
 Teena Marie - Sapphire (Cash Money Classics, 2006)  I picked up Teena Marie's latest album, Sapphire, the other day. As I listened to it, I started to think very fondly about "A Rose By Any Other Name" (featuring Gerald Levert), "I'm So In Love", "Black Rain", and "I'm on Fire". Those songs are, however, from her last album, La Doï¿½a. When you listen to an artist's current album and can't stop thinking about how good her last one was, there's a problem.  It's not that any of these songs are bad, or that she's trying too hard to be cool (we're already used to veterans trying to fit into today's urban landscape). It's just that most of this album is dull and boring. A lot of the songs are about love and sex; even her last album was more varied in theme. Also, the musical arrangements leave a lot to be desired. The good songs to me have to be the very first one ("God Has Created" with Smokey Robinson) and the very last one ("Resilient [Sapphire]" with her daughter, Alia Rose).   What's between those are 70 minutes of filler with the exception of "You Blow Me Away". And for "Baby Who's Is It"  ("who's" should be spelled "whose", by the way), it is unnecessary for Kurupt and Teena to rap and sing (respectively) the same lyrics together. One or the other would have been fine. Furthermore, I don't really wanna hear about Teena smoking spliffs on a reggae-lite jam ("Simmer Down"). And what's the deal with "Somebody Just Like You" ending with her saying, "Are you ever gonna get a job?" It doesn't even go with what she was talking about.  This review may be unpopular but I just wasn't feeling this album. Call me an old head but I think I'll go back to listening to La Doï¿½a or even better, her older, early '80s stuff. -EJ 
 I found this system disorganized, inefficient and ultimately ineffective for learning Spanish.   There is too much English on the tape and very little conversational or cultural context.  A good system would have dialog presented in context with lots of repetition and building drills and minimal English explanation on tape.  Or maybe put the explanation on separate CD tracks so that it can be skipped after it is heard a time or two.   By the way, the CD tracks seemed to be cut-up randomly and had very little flow or consistency.    I have not tried any of the other systems but this one was a disappointment 
 I couldn't find a single moment of originality in the entire album. I feel the Blackmore/Candice join venture grows more and more mediocre with every album. 
 I found this to be a waste.  If i would have saw a bad review (which it  deserved i would have saved my money).  Don't waste your time buy another  book 
 Our department has been repeated spammed by the author in a pathetic attempt to sell his theory and book. Do you really want to read a book by someone desparate enough to spam Astronomy departments everywhere? I can tell you for a fact now that this book as no legitimate claim to science. Instead he manipulates big words and concepts to confuse the general public. Don't waste your money or time on this book! 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 This is a disappointing book.  I had read a couple of Wilber's earlier books and liked them, especially the superb "Grace and Grit."  At his best, he can be very good at explaining a nondualistic Eastern style philosophy.  As the title suggests, this book is meant to introduce people to an all encompassing metaphysical system.  No one could attempt such an enterprise without a little hubris.  But why stop at a little?  Wilber is fond of dropping the names of long lists of famous intellectuals whose work he finds consistent with, but subservient to, his system.  Reality is sliced and diced in an endless taxonomy of levels, holons, stages, paradigm shifts, quadrants, centers, spheres and fulcrums before being reassembled into a nondualistic whole.  Anyone satisfied with scientific explainations is dismissed as a "reductionist" holding what he calls "an insane world view."  The science based world view is not so much argued against as it is insulted, dismissed and misrepresented.  The most remarkable thing in this book is it's bizzare description of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory.  He makes the astonishing claim that very few theorists believe in Darwinian evolution and that, "There is no evidence whatsoever for intermediate (fossil) forms."  Wilber maintains it would take at least a hundred simultaneous beneficial mutations for something like a wing to evolve.  He claims this would have to occur separately in both a male and a female who would then have to mate successfully.  This is a grotesque caricature of Darwinan theory.  Anyone who thinks it is adequate should buy this book.  Others should read Richard Dawkins "Climbing Mount Improbable."  Wilber never names any scientists who advocate this version of evolution for the very good reason that there aren't any.  What accounts for this straw man caricature of the most foundational scientific theory in modern biology?  Well, Darwinian theory predicts that two species competing for the same niche will compete very fiercely.  Wilber's Hegelian style spirit based pantheism competes with a science based pantheism in the tradition of Spinoza, Darwin and Einstein.    This book is written in a question and answer format.  I bought it on audio cassette.  The questions were read by a young woman.  Her tone indicates she is struggling to understand.  She is always co-operative and eager to receive the wisdom from on high.   The answers are read by a man.  His tone is authoritative and patiently condescending.  This is perfect for the text.  Here is a one sentence sample, from the book, of Wilber's writing at it's worst:  "So we have some very popular theorists who, tired of the burdens of postconventional and world-centric rational perspectivism, recommend a regressive slide into egocentric vital impulsive polymorphous phantasmic emotional revival."   Like Hegel, Wilber has attracted legions of readers who assume that his most incomprehensible writing must be his most brilliant.  If you are willing to make that assumption, this book will delight you 
 Clare Ballenger works as a divorce councellor, helping women find closure as their marriages fall apart, but Clare's own life is not exactly perfect. She lost her husband years before to a hunting 'accident' and has felt guilty ever since. Although two men are madly in love with her, Clare treats both of them as 'friends,' refusing to take their proposals seriously. Meanwhile, Clare's best friend, Dora has gotten back with her husband Son, against Clare's advice. Clare believes that Son can only make Dora unhappy.   Clare's batting average in terms of seeing what's going on around her falls even lower when her daughter's marriage falls apart as well. Still, Clare keeps busy building a retreat center for divorcing and divorced women on land given her by her mother-in-law. There, near the bay, Clare hopes to bring a peace to troubled women that she herself cannot find.   Author Cassandra King writes evocatively of the south, with families who have known one another for generations, instinctual distrust for imported Yankees, still-strained racial relations, and especially a kind of sisterhood. In QUEEN OF BROKEN HEARTS, women are the only characters with any depth--all of the men, including love interests Rhy and Lex, seem to exist only in their relationship to the women of their life. Indeed, Dory's husband Son refuses to go anywhere without his wife, and Clare's final decision between the two men who love her is driven not by the qualities of these men themselves, but by Clare's relationships with other men.   Although King's writing is strong and occasionally highly emotional, I found the story confusing and the characters sometimes unsympathetic. From the very beginning, when Clare ran out from a restaurant rather than face Son, Clare refuses to confront her own wishes and needs--which could have been the basis for a character arc, but if so, it was one King didn't fully explore.   Although QUEEN OF BROKEN HEARTS was occasionally frustrating, Kings writing was strong enough to propell me through the story. 
 Having been raised with this book and terrified by it sixty years ago, I cannot recommend it as a child-rearing tool for the new millenium.  I would hope that the parents of today would have developed better ways of  socializing and civilizing their children 
 It never came. I double check the shipping address and it was exactly correct 
 This book is not for the average reader. It uses extremely technical terms to convey simple expressions. Explanations such as thread concepts were over stated and confusing. I returned my copy.   
 Well, here goes. Kates previous books were interesting and I could see this being a series as big as Jordans "Wheel of Time" But it seems that she has decided to try (unsuccesfully) to gather all the loose ends in this story so that she can have a finale in the next book. There is so much information in this book it was very hard to keep afloat. Sorry but this was a sad and lackluster book, hard to read and digest 
 It has been over a month and I have YET to receive my movie!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Most people considered this the Cheap Trick "comeback" album.  Sixteen years after the fact I'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a "go-back" album instead.  While Cheap Trick didn't set the music world on fire with most of their 80's releases, it wasn't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release "The Doctor" that I actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums.  On "The Doctor" I searched but came up empty.  "Lap Of Luxury" isn't quite that bad, but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow.  I've made dozens of Cheap Trick compilations over the years and "Let Go" was the only song that I included off of LOL.  The thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the 80's and early 90's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the Trick back to their rockin' roots.  Well let me tell ya, this is far from it.  I know.  I remember 
 I absorb "foodie" books at the rate that some breathe.  Reichl, Bourdain, Child, Buxton and others are the source of hours of fond distraction from my too-busy-to-do-anything life and my aspirations to understand food the way I understand my professional work -- intuitively, technically and personally.  I had read that this book was more of a bawdy personal history than others, but I always adore the personal details of the writers, and am hardly a prude. Nevertheless, I could hardly muster an ounce of empathy for the gratuitous sexual self-objectification of the author who viewed restaurants more as stars in a social strata than producers of cuisine.  I did not care about her tortured relationship with a porn star, whom she fed and bedded on her employer's dime.  I grew exasperated as she ended a chapter about three marriages with a confession that she wrote it without understanding the point, and still, after writing it and choosing to include it in her book, she did not.  The simple reality is that a writer is speaking to a reader, and Ms. Green's reader appeared to be...Ms. Green.  While it is apparent that others enjoyed this book, I would suspect that a day with "Garlic and Sapphires" would disabuse anyone of the notion that this is a delightful memoir, and instead expose it for the indulgence that it is 
 I just watched the recent Frontline about Tank Man, the man who bravely defied the line of tanks in Beijing, and went to Amazon to find books about the subject. Up came this book, among others, and I remember almost throwing it across the room over ten years ago when I read it. You have a guy who escaped, knew a few people involved, and whose only personal involvement is from the outside. He had no balls, and never dared risk himself. Sure, he knows the figureheads, the history, and can write about what happened as if was there. But he was hiding in his room, making himself out to be a hero. If you want to read a book with the only suspense being whether to finish it or not, then this is the one 
 Ooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh SNAP!  So busted!!!  Read all about it:  Bad Writer Gets Nailed For Posing & Tricking & Using All US Good People To Pad Their Pocket!  And all that stuff about a woman need to fake herself as a gay, abused, homeless, infected, drug addicted teenage boy to get her crunk published is just lame lame LAME!  NEWS FLASH:  The publishing industry, unlike most, is populated by women in high power positions, etc. etc. etc.!!!  So here's how it's rolling out over the wire now:   Now that we know that LeRoy is a chimera created by a writer with equal gifts for fiction and fraud, this book is a vile cesspit with no redeeming qualities at all. It's one of those icky stories about the United States that certain kinds of Europeans like but with none of the artistry.  It makes you feel like a terrier is pushing your nose into the mess he just left on the kitchen floor.  Dr. Babby suggests:  Dear Used & Marketed To Death By Scuzzy Funkwad Hoaxsters, don't despair.  There's plenty of really good, really serious, and really talented writers doing good work.  Stuff you've never heard of, but you'd probably enjoy.  Avoid Leroy, take two good novels by anyone else, and call me in the morning.  OUT 
 This book might be okay for someone who's lived on a deserted island for the past 20 years, or has the IQ of 30 or below, but otherwise, I say "one star".    This is one of the most poorly written "non-diet" books I have ever had the misfortune of reading.  It is almost an insult to one's intelligence because this woman is merely repeating much of what most of us have heard for years - and she can't even manage to do so  creatively.  An acquaintance from work asked me to read this book after her daughter bought it for her because she wanted to see if I didn't agree that many of the ideas in it undeniably paralleled Bob Schwartz' 'Diets Still Don't Work' book. Well, I read it, and,  I have to say, some of his ideas do indeed seem to have been 'reborn' (albeit poorly) in this book.  The 'dedication' from this woman appears rather lofty, as do the subsequent pages of 'testimonials' which, I deduced, were supplied to make the reader feel s/he was onto a lucky find.  Surprisingly, they all seemed rather shallow and written in a very singular style.  The entire body of the book has the feel that she's addressing naughty school children instead of attempting to show sincere compassion to  sensitive people who've no doubt paid good money just to learn genuinely helpful weight loss methods.  There are also numerous vague areas in the book that just don't make much sense: mixed messages about how and what to eat.  ...As if overweight people need any *more* confusion to muddle through in their weight-loss dilemmas.  Many of the suggestions she throws out there to take up space on the pages just aren't realistic.  I think Ms. Fleming just found an easy way to make some extra Christmas money for herself in 2005.  Good for her, but bad for the hopeful yet serious-minded  seekers 
 I bought this item because other comforters from this seller had good reviews, but it was a complete mistake!  It really was dingy like described by other reviewer.  I returned it, but lost over twenty five dollars in back and forth shipping costs for this item.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS PRODUCT OR SELLER 
 Every once in a while I like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset I picked up "Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now."  And what did I find as a result of my maverick literary exploration?  Ehh...  Ms. Angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful.  If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere 
 For obvious reasons this book should be easy to read. Unfortunately it isn't, especially not if you're not English (and due to the theme of the book, at least one of two readers could be expected to be non English). The book is full of incredibly long sentences and woolly language and the constant use of terms like 'minority language' and 'majority language' is very confusing.  So far for the style. Now the content. Contrary to the subtitle it's not practical at all. One parent should speak one language, the other should speak the other, both should be consistent - that's the message that is repeated over and over again, and it's about the only practical advice you'll find here. The rest is a heap of possible situations without really valuable tips. Most of the comments from bilingual parents you'll read in this book seem out of context and are therefore not useful. Why a 2 stars rating and not 1? The book was written with honest intentions and I think the authors did their best. But, Mr. Publisher, where was your editor?  
 Again, another interesting pop-corn director that makes a couple of good low budget films and when Hollywood gives to him a free hand (or not so much) things go wrong.  Is not funny, Wilson and Stiller aren't interesting enough and the 70's isn't a good decade to crave for.  With this kind of films, is useful to listen to American critics, they know more about their own culture than us 
    Another anxiety-driven media clown with nothing remotely clever to say.  Save your money. 
 I find this book personally insulting and full of revisionist conclusions. As a Romani who lost Grandmother and many Aunts and Uncles in the Porrajmos (the devouring in Romany)I am outraged that once again we, the victims of this insanity are blamed for the crimes committed against us. That ANY victims of the Holocaust are essentially blamed for their own demise is cruel and unjustified. I also contest, and detest, Mr. Lewy's conclustion that the Roma people were not racially marked for extermination: this is both absurd and untrue as withnessed by the nazi's own words, we were "lives unworthy of life, we were criminals due to our genetics, Germany must be cleansed of the Gypsy plague" etc. An inaccurate book full of racial sterotypes, the gist of which was used by the nazi's as justification for the extermination of the Roma in the first place and is still being used to justify the persecution of Roma today. Horrid book 
 The movie has too many cameo's or how ever it is spelled, I dont like this Freddy or the second Movie the rest our good though 
 Dear Oh Dear... Another paganistic and beastly concoction disguised as spiritual awakening. Obviously influenced by the likes of A A Bailey, H P Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley and other Beastly doers of deception. Notice the 666 slightly camouflaged but still blatantly obvious on the front cover? I urge you to read this but to be analytical and on your guard as many of the buzzwords and phrases have alternative meanings. Good people DO NOT be fooled by this ungodly attempt at corrupting the hearts and minds of vulnerable people. May the true God (not some spirit of the earth or a LSD-trip) bless you all 
 A few of these stories are redeaming.  The one in which a girl pretends to be a lesbian, and the man learning how to fly-fish.  The rest of them are downright terrible and should be avoided like the plague.  The editor, Edward Faine, has the worst story among the bunch.  It reads like it was written by a 16 year old high school student.  Don't waste your money 
 The author is very quick to jump to unwarranted conclusions.  Rather than relying on well-reasoned arguments, he cites authorities, frequently distorting his sources.  He fails to prove his view of Biblical law and its  relationship to the American Constitution.  He fails to provide any  evidence for many of his most important points.   He does not reveal that  the source for many of his ideas is in Mormon theology.  EN 
 an amazingly bad movie. eddie murphy (who was funny in the 80s) manages the near-impossible: he makes jerry lewis seem sophisticated. now dont get me wrong; i love stupid comedy -- when its funny. murphy never convinces an iota here in the role of the HUGE professor klump. there is scads of humor to be mined in the struggles of fat people to fit into the normal world (take my word, i know about THAT) -- just recall oliver hardy's girth getting him stuck in a doorway during his attempt to escape bogeyland -- but murphy is merely contemptuous and nasty. well, contemptuous and nasty in a comedy i can accept, but it better be funny. this movie has a high spot on my list of the 10 worst i have ever seen. 
 although this book had lots of information i needed more direction and actual meal ideas to get started 
 The reason many of us fail to succeed is that we buy into common sense.  This book does just that by reinforcing bad practices.  It suggests that one should save and invest wisely.  There is little way in which a person could achieve significant wealth by this method though perhaps a good retirement.  The most successful people do not follow this method.  I am pretty well off myself and I can say I did not follow this method and had I, I would not be doing so well.  Unfortunately there is not a solid path to wealth (not that I know of).  Compare the wealth of Richard Branson versus Donald Trump - two very different approaches without few similarities.  My mother followed this approach and ended with just a small savings.  The story sounds appealing until you realize that it is fiction - there was no such man and that should speak for itself.  
 Women in America are so fun to be with, so wonderful, and so full of life, it's sad the men in this country haven't taken notice of them.  This book points the finger where it is needed most - at the menfolk!  While we do face a 43% divorce rate and a 17% separation rate in this country with 65+% of those divorces and separations initiated by the wives of those marriages, and women are overwhelmingly favored to receive alimony and child support over men in family court, this should be of no concern to men.  Oh, and also if you have a woman in your home or are married to her for a short while, you may be liable for a huge amount of palimony or alimony.  Oh, and evidentiary due process is not required for you to be convicted of domestic violence in family court.  You may end up losing your children, house, bank account and freedom if your wife decides she is bored and wants to "move on".  Uhhh, never mind... 
 its really funny that christians are saying that the quraan is contradictry ( the wine story) because we all know that there are so many different bibles with so many contradictory views. let me enligthen you, ther quraan was revealed over 1400 yrs ago and yet not one word, not a single letter, or even a punctuation mark has been changed. and litteraly billions of muslims learn the quraan by heart ( the entire 30 chapters) every day, young and old, men and women, your so called fundamentalists and mordernists.   now about the wine verses. you need to know that before the quraan was revealed arabia was steeped in "ignorance". it was a norm to bury baby girls alive!!! the quraan was revealed over a  period of 23yrs and bit by bit things were forbidden. the first wine related verse told muslims " Oh ye who believe donot go near prayer while ye are intoxicated until you know well what you say"  the second verse says "hey ask thee concerning wine (al-khamri) and gambling. Say: "In them is great sin, AND SOME PROFIT, for men; but the sin is greater than the profit.""  ye who believe! Intoxicants (al-khamru) and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) arrows, are AN ABOMINATION,- OF SATAN'S HANDWORK: eschew such (abomination), that ye may prosper. Satan's plan is (but) to excite enmity and hatred between you, with intoxicants (al-khamri) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah, and from prayer: will ye not then abstain? S. 5:90  so ofcourse you as a non muslim would be confused. contradictory?No!  you see for us muslims the quraan is our guide and the hadeeth-sayings of the Prophet Muhammed is the key to understanding the Quraan. God, in his infinate wisdom were "weening" the muslims of wine.   we r all aware of the harms of alcohol. if u dont drink alcohol u have no chance of becoming an alcoholic! For us muslims, wine which is a luxury will be offered to us in paradise  neways about the terrororism issue. This guy is so misinformed, im starting to wander if he is for real.  Get this, Islam tottaly forbids the killing of women and children, the old, the innocent and even trees @ the time of  war! What is this man going on about i dont know.  Even suicide is islam is forbidden, so suiciding bombing is NOT ALLOWED! especially since it may be harming the innocent. I mean even abortion is not allowed!!  Islam and women abuse? Puhleeeez! I am a muslim woman, my religion is ISLAM!Do i feel abused, misused,opprressed? NO!!!  Look, a mans responsibility in Islam is far greater than a womens. For example my share of inheritance is slightly less than a mans. Does this mean islam is unfair!It only means that a man is supposed to use his inheritance to feed and clothe the women in society who have NOTHING, like a bag lady for example. I can do whatever i want with my money, my brother cant!  A husbands responsibitly is greater than a wifes. Therefore his status is higher, a mothers responsibility is greater than a fathers therefore her status is higher. Islam believes in the equality of sexes not the identicality of the two!!!  As for a man having four wives,he has to treat them exactly the same, imagine that if you have four wives and you decide to buy a dkny handbag 4 1 wife,the other 3 need to get the same. A swimming pool for 1, yip the other 3 need one to! And hes reseon for marrying the other 3 wives should not be driven by lust.    If islam is treated as a whole, if people read both the Quraan, and consulted the hadeeth, than i believe even the problem of poverty would be eliminated. Because in Islam we have to give, give and give.One of our fundemental principles tell us to give 2.4% of our wealth to the poor every year. Imagine if everyone who is able to so,does this! We should wish for others what we wish for ourselves  So for those of you who think Islam is the religion of terrorists you are sadly misinformed!  Books like this, are a product of religious hatred. It inflames hatred of other religions for islam, and for islam to the rest of the world. Its not my religion that is turning muslims into terrorists its the usage of this kind of propoganda against the muslims that fuels a passion that they cannot control. It blinds them from realising that being violent ( By this i include burning up embassies) is wrong, prohibited, and is not the way to move forward.     
 Unfortunatley, Ms. Ornstein's book is not based on actual research, but rather on pre-established suppositions. The gender climate of a school is best evaluated by looking at two factors - student grades and disciplinary actions.  If male students have lower grades than female students, and/or if more male students are disciplined than female students, then it is clear that the school is anti-boy and is simply not trying to teach male students.  Fortunatley, parents are waking up to this fact, and there have been several lawsuits (most notably in Wisconsin) challenging public schools gender bias against male students.  The so called "gender-fair" class menitoned in this book wasn't - since not as many male as female students received "A's".    This book also does not evaluate issues outside of school.  For example, the best measure of the status of a demographic group is to look at mortality rate.  The fact that male students in all demographic groups have a higher mortality rate than female students is not discussed.  This is particularly important since a major contributing factor to this trend is the fact that adolescent males have a higher suicide rate than adolescent females.  Orenstein also does not discuss this gender gap in arrest rate.  Again, the "health" of a demographic group in school is easy to evaluate - simply look at grades and discipline.  
 This book is horrible for learning Graph Theory. It is hard to understand and follow. I don't recommend it at all, especially as a new student. It might be useful as a reference after you learn everything, but it's layout is crammed, crunched and unreadable. I can't understand the simple topics, I had to do internet research to decipher the text 
 I think there may be a hint of jealousy in this book.  I've often thought of Zizek as the kind of guy who strives to be the rock star of philosophy. Of course, more than ten years after his death, Deleuze is packing more philosophical arenas than Zizek ever will.  This is because, in my humble opinion, Zizek is and always will be a second rate philosopher.  He is the Douglas Coupland of academic philosophy in that, while he is often an interesting read, one always walks away from the book feeling like they've gained nothing but a few perverse ways of stating the obvious.  I will admit, Zizek has a flare for writing, notably, I think in the Ticklish Subject and Welcome to the Desert of the Real.  But this book not only failed to accomplish it's goals but it did so rather uninterestingly.  Somewhere around the end of the first third of the book he quotes Deleuze's famous passage about buggering other philosophers in the behind.  I've always loved the passage and til that point I thought the book was heating up so I had hopes of engaging in an eye-opening debate about Deleuze with both the text and my own preconceptions.  But what I got from that point on was a stream of endless, pretentious comparisions between what most people assume Hegel meant and what Zizek somehow interprets Deleuze to mean.    Basically, it seemed to me like Zizek's project was misguided in that it relied too heavily on a limited interpretation of Deleuze based on Zizek's slight admiration for the Logic of Sense and his disdain for Deleuze's work with Guattari.  Zizek almost comes off as a crying child who wanted ice cream when everyone else wanted cake and couldn't have his way.  He passes over without even the slightest mention the idea that perhaps A Thousand Plateau's truly is a revolutionary text (or radical series of texts - whatever).  He does this because he likes better the ideas he has developed out of the Logic of Sense.    In other words, Zizek is fatalistically attached to the offspring that emerged when Deleuze's logic of sense poked him in the butt.  The joke's on you, Slavoj 
 This book is very dissapointing. Sure, this book is full of information, but does not know how to teach. This book is not completely written in step by step method. Before you actually start touch your project, you are fed up with information. I even found a couple of mistakes in earlier chapter. DVD comes with this book, but this DVD is not a lesson project like Apple Pro Training Series. Not useful. If you are beginner and start studying DVD Studio Pro 4, don't by this book! You're going to waste your money. Buy the one from Apple Pro Training Series, which is much better, easy to understand. 
 This is the first one of the "Cat Who..." books that I have read. I thought this book was going to get really good but it never did.  I thought it was kind of boring because it really didn't have a point.  It just rambled on and on. This book was only a little interesting when Quill was interviewing people for things to put in the book he is writing. This book was mostly boring though again becase it had no point, it would go to one subject and then not carry on with that and go to something completely different. Overall this book was just okay 
 Well let's start on a positive note; Gone for Good in this reader's eyes is far from being a perfect work, oh and yes, the reviews are great.  Over-the-top reviews always surprises me on a work that is so obviously flawed as this one seems to me. I would love to praise this book as Harlen Corban can most certainly write well when he doesn't get carried away. However, in Gone for Good something went badly wrong as the author makes incredible efforts to turn on the thrills with plot and character twists that degenerate from being simply implausible to convoluted and on to farcical. There again I suppose that the author does deserve a star or two if he himself was capable of following his own up-side down, inside out and round about story line. Apart from which, there was so much boring exposition; how does it go; show, don't tell. I also had a serious problem with another of the writer's exaggerations which was over-the-top violence; but then he made amends at the end when one of the arch villains turns out to be a goofy, teary-eyed, goody-goody in disguise ... oh, come on.  
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 This book dares to be called an historical work. It should be deemed a fantasy.  Rarely does the author clearly articulate reasons for her sweeping and farcical assumptions.  When she describes Lizzie Borden as proof positive that the Cornells were genetically disposed to get angry enough to kill, she clearly crosses the line.  Ms. Crane thanks her husband for his help by stating that he was her partner in crime.  It's truly a crime that this book was ever published 
 The GPS works great!  Having said that, I'm disappointed with the 5919 overall.  I could not get the free map updates from TomTom because HP does not include the Navigator 6 product code with the 5915.  HP's support promised they'd get the maps and post them for 5915 users, but that hasn't happened after several months of promises.  The wireless worked only with non-encrypted networks, and even then, only for 1 day.  I have to perform a soft-reset at least three times a day because the system hangs.  MP3s play fine.  It will play video, albeit they are very choppy.  USB connections to the computer seem to work only after loading the very latest MS ActiveSync, and only after a soft-reset.  Even then, having the computer recognize the device is very "iffy".   The unit is a great idea if you travel--maps, email, Internet, music, contacts, appointments, etc., but if it doesn't work, it becomes a paperweight.  I've read dozens of forums with others complaining of the same issues.  HP support so far has been nothing but lip service.  My recommendation--don't fall for the marketing hype, this unit still has to have a lot of bugs worked out 
 There's less than 60 pages of actual content in this book, and those are small paperback pages in a very large font. We're talking oh, maybe, ten single-spaced typed pages of garbled inspirational material. There is some explanation of the Law of Attraction, but a lot of unrelated concepts. Yoga? Buddhism? Very little practical advice on how to apply the theory to your everyday life.  This book seems to me like a quickly thrown-together attempt to cash in on a current spiritual fad. If you are interested in pursuing the Law of Attraction -- which I have found to be a very useful and compelling concept -- try The Secret, or Ask and It Is Given 
 The problem is:  If you are not familiar with 20th Century Irish history, you will be lost reading this book when Part 1 ends. Doyle provides the reader with no historical background and writes the book assuming that the reader is all ready well-versed in Irish history.  I also had trouble visualizing Ireland, the places, buildings, streets, and the battle scenes, which I attribute to Doyle's lack of description and to my lack of Irish knowledge 
 This is a recorder with many nice features but mine lasted only a few dozen hours (but did make it beyond the very short warrenty).  It was well cared for and still does not have even the tiniest scratch but it simply did not last long.  For the price I expected a durable and well built machine. I was very disappointed and could not personally recommend it 
 Poor man was so confused, he couldn't complete a thought and mistook his confusion for enlightenment. If he'd only seen a psychiatrist for his mother issues and latent homosexuality, maybe he'd have been able to finish more than a handful of books in his lifetime 
 Asian Cult Cinema is a bad book.  The reviews are flawed and the information is either flat out wrong or badly researched.  The movie synopises are down right absmal and  headache inducing.  I bought a copy of this book back in 1997.  After reading it and doing my own research I sent the writer a huge list of corrections.  I recieved a postcard with a note of acknowledgement. A few years later it was reprinted with the same errors.  Instead of buying this book go out and get a copy of Hong Kong Babylon.  At least the writers went out and did their homework and put some time and effort into it.  A.C.C. is flat out aweful.  I would avoid it like the plague.  Even the pictures are mislabeled.  At his website he charges high prices for videos that are availible elsewhere.  You even have to be a member just to purchase these videos.  For shame.  Don't even think about it 
   First, I know this review looks too long, but it might help you out. So please, read on.  I read a few of the "chapters" (exercise sections) of this book and found it to be a little too conversational. Sure, we all value a charming and witty instruction book to a dry academic one, but I still think she brings nothing new to this genre of book.    It seems like she could easily have gotten all of these ideas from other writing books, seminars and articles, and frankly, most of them are better written than this one. You've probably encountered most of the ideas put forth in this book, beginning with an intro akin to:    "Oh, we all say we're going to write, but we never get around to it. Well never, fear, because [insert generic writing guide book title] is here to kick your rear in gear!"    Something like that.     There are really so many different types of books, kits, articles, memoirs, classes and manifestos on the subject of writing, exercises, inspiration and so forth. (Just do a search on Amazon for Writing Instruction or Writing for Publication.)  I really can't recommend this book, though.      Unfortunately, the author also thinks it's cute or somehow necessary to write quite a few words in ALLCAPS to add emphatic notice to the concept. Personally, I think that WRITING like THIS every few PAGES looks unprofessional and can be quite IRRITATING. This stylistic flaw alone makes me wonder whether she's a very credible source. Is font manipulation creative? Sure, to an extent, but "all-caps" serves no purpose, and it's easy to do and banal.     I think that this work misses a point about writing: it requires self-discipline as well as inspiration and talent. It's easy and sometimes fun to get caught up in books like these, but really, if you just read a varity of nonfiction, novels and periodicals for a few hours each week you can begin to understand observational skills, and you won't need these silly little exercises.  You'll be inspired by what you read, and how the articles or whatever you read remind you of your own experiences.    So, the point is, if you feel that you need to spend money on a book like this, perhaps you don't have the ability to discipline yourself into a steady routine of journaling and writing. Buying a book like this one will allow you to read some tips and eventually forget about it. After brief excitement and productivity, you'll be back to square one; with no self-discipline, you'll never apply this book to your life week-by-week as you should. It will collect dust next to your yoga books.  I offer this criticism not to sound nasty, but to make you think about what you are buying.   It's simple to buy a Men's Fitness magazine, for instance, but it won't help you unless you actually work out routinely. Same thing.   I guess the bottom line is that this book is okay for a casual read, but look it over in a bookstore first to see if you really want to pay the price of owning it.   I give it about 2.4 stars. 
 A very broad list of questions with high level answers. I wouldn't buy this book if I were looking for a deep framework to handle this topic 
 I admire Vollman's ambition in this novel.  He is a thinker who seems to be attempting to tie together aspects of religion (Buddhism, Christianity, and Paganism . . . ); commentary on the differences / similarities of love, lust, and addiction; Capitalism versus Marxism; racism between all colors of all people; classicism; reality and fantasy; misogyny; unions; child-love or child-molestation depending how you look at it . . . the list goes on.  And this is exactly the problem with it.  The connections are vague--not subtle.  Fragments connected by tiny threads that fray as the book continues leave us suspended in a kind of weird sickness--ready to fall.  If I were Vollman, I would have let this book sit for a while and then returned to it in an attempt to clarify and condense . . . maybe map out this Royal Family to make it worth his while and worth our while as readers.  His characterizations and insight about human fraily are immaculate.  I don't advise giving up on him yet.  He has potential.  But I don't think spending days reading this will get you anywhere but depressed and tired 
 My favorite from this one had to be the fat guy's comment -- "I'd be a rich man if I had a dime for every hour i've spent auditing Pentagon departments" -- what - he doesn't make more than $0.10 per hour?  In 1987?  Give me a break.  Yes, these are great page turners.  But the dialog is absolutely horrendous.    Shakespeare, he is not.   
 The Little Rascals collection is a set of 5 DVDs with a few shorts on each DVD, the fifth disk with an extra from the 50s and a documentary about child stars. This set was poorly put together, the shorts included are quite random, and buying this set would be a waste of money.  Each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters. First there is Alfalfa, then Buckwheat, Spanky, Darla, Porky, Mickey, Stymie, then Fatty- oh wait, no that is Joe Cobb only they didn't know his real name, then Farina, and last Phil MacMahon- WHO you may be asking? Phil MacMahon, the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in Our Gang Follies of 1938. Still don't know him? Maybe that is because he wasn't a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection.  Disk One features the shorts Dogs of War and Derby Day. Dogs of War is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the Hal Roach lot; it is one of my favorite shorts from the series. However, it seems that they ripped off the Cabin Fever print and added a worse score. Derby Day also seems to be lifted from the Cabin Fever series. It is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races. The films themselves are very good.  Disk Two features a rarer silent film called Stage Fright. It is a film about a show put on about Marc Anthony by the kids in front of their parents. It is a total disaster. Just like in Reunion in Rhythm, one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry. The film has been seriously cut; there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length. The print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted. The music is much more childish than normal silent Rascals scores, but it works. There are sound effects too. Sundown Limited is a great short about the gang building their own train. It is a very cute film; Farina is especially funny in it. The train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood. The print is washed out and the music sounds just like Grapevine Video's soundtracks. The film titled The Pirates in this set is really called The Buccaneers. It is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship. When it sinks, they find a real one to destroy. This short has also been cut; there is no opener for it either. It is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it.  Disk Three opens with Mary Queen of Tots. It is a really enjoyable film where Mary receives toys that look like the gang. She dreams they come to life, and when she wakes up, she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life. This print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made DVD set. It is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though. The Fourth Alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters. The print on this one is not bad at all. The last film is School's Out, a talkie featuring a different cast. It is a film featuring Miss Crabtree, the new teacher. The picture is good; it seems to be the one from Cabin Fever.  Disk Four begins with Bear Shooters. This is a less than great film. The print is great; it is the one from Cabin Fever. Our Gang Follies of 1938 is a great film, very funny, long, and exciting. It features the later talkie cast. Waldo's Last Stand is a film from the later MGM years, a lesser film that seems forced. It was also released in a 5 part Rascals set.  Disk Five is the extra features DVD. It starts out with a segment from the You Asked For It television show. On it, some of the silent gang are reunited. Joe Cobb, Jackie Condon, Farina Hoskins, Johnny Downs, and Mickey Daniels are featured. The documentary called Kid Stuff really doesn't have a whole lot of information about the gang although Jackie Cooper is mentioned and Butch Bond does an interview. Other child stars like Jackie Coogan, Judy Garland, Shirley Temple, Roddy McDowall, and Ron Howard are focused on as well.  The films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain. Many of them have been available cheaply for years. The only reason a fan might want to see this collection, the same reason I bothered, was to see the rarer silent films. However, the rest of the set is trash 
 Let's set aside the fact that Robert Coles knows little or nothing about what makes Bruce Springsteen an artist worthy of close study. To Coles, Springsteen is an abstraction, some hazy creature who fits into Coles' ideas about "documentary art." Coles has nothing to teach people about Springsteen because from his writing here it's clear he doesn't have a clue.  Dr. Coles has written well over 50 books in his career of 40-plus years. And probably two or three of them are actually quite good and readable. THE CALL OF STORIES is a great book. The CHILDREN OF CRISIS READER is very good, although its "documentary" tales are a little too neatly packaged and tied up to be considered totally accurate.   Coles is considered somewhat of a "guru" for Documentary Work in this country. To a growing number of critics, this is an ironic distinction given that in many of his books he may be using composites of various real people. Or he may be embellishing real events and conversations to suit his needs. Less "Truth" and more "Truthiness" as comedian Stephen Colbert might put it.   Reviewers who complain about his writing style have valid criticisms. I'd describe the writing as stream-of-consciousness meets psychoanalytic note-taking with a healthy sprinkling of colloquialisms from old Mickey Rooney movies. And it's true - the man refuses to use "periods" as tools of punctuation. His sentences run on and on with clauses pasted together by commas, semi-colons, dashes, you name it. At Harvard University where he used to teach, faculty and students nicknamed him Robert "No Word Goes Unpublished" Coles!!!  As for the veracity of this "oral history" study??...Critics have hinted that after the success of CHILDREN OF CRISIS in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he found it easier and easier to just fabricate his sources. He has a bad habit of making the quotations of his subjects sound too much like his own voice. And it seems that he always has at his fingertips just the PERFECT quote coming from the many famous observers he has known (ranging from Dorothy Day to Walker Percy to Paul Tillich to Robert F. Kennedy). You would think Coles must have discussed every subject under the sun with these people to have such a catalogue of quoted remarks.  The Springsteen book is no exception when it comes to the typical flaws in Coles' work, only more so. He quotes dozens of "hard working citizens" (a condescending term coming from a Harvard psychiatrist) saying things that sound just like Coles/Mickey Rooney (and yet lack insight into Springsteen).  An article in The New Republic magazine at the time of this book's publication formally labels the charge of fabrication at Coles. A review in The Vilage Voice called this the "worst book ever written about Bruce Springsteen."  In short, I think that some of the stuff in this book is mostly made up to suit whatever point Coles is making on the page. I have no axe to grind with the author - I Just think the evidence is there (if you look for it) to support fabrication and sloppiness.   Dr. Coles has at some point decided that he has all the answers. The voices in his tales are simply characters set up to make a point that Coles himself has worked out in his mind. Somewhere along the way, the documentarian became lazy or self-satisfied, or both. When it comes to Springsteen, Robert Coles is just dancing in the dark 
 Is "Ladykillers" a buddy-caper movie? Is it a religious metaphor? Is it a quirky comedy with supernatural overtones? Is it "Reservoir Dogs"? Is it a star-making turn about an unforgettable character?  It apparently tries to be all these things.   What it ACTUALLY is is an unfunny, schizophrenic, mean-spirited mess.   The movie starts out with great promise. Tom Hanks stars as what appears to be a somewhat-pompous, Edgar Allan Poe-quoting, Colonel Sanders vest-wearing, over-educated, genteel Southern professor of Renaissance music. What he actually is is a (still-likable) con-man and swindler. At least, that's what he starts out as at the beginning of the film. His dialogue is supurb, his accent and portrayal spot-on.   He decides he wants to rob a casino. In order to do this he devises a scheme to tunnel into the casino's counting room from underground. To fascilitate his plan, he lets a room in an old woman's house close to the casino, and convinces his landlady that he actually needs her basement to practice with his band of musicians. He cobbles together an unlikely assemblage of partners in crime, which include a Chinese general who has a Hitler complex (he even has a Hitler mustache), a strange jack-of-all-trades and explosives expert who can't stop farting, a stupid football player to do the digging, and Marlon Wayans, who plays the beyond-stereotypical black thug who loves rap music and constantly threatens to shoot people with his gun while yelling expletives. The Chinese general has a total dialogue of four words the entire movie (I'm not kidding, I counted!) and the football player about 12. What the point of those two characters was I'm not really sure.  Now, you'd think that with such a motley crew, there would be slapstick humor galore. Well, nope. There are "incidents" which often revolve around farting, one scene where a guy blows his finger off with explosives (I THINK that was supposed to be funny---it's tough to tell) and a lot of scenes with Mr Wayans saying "F-this" and "F-that" while waving his gun around.   Still, for the first 75% of the movie, I was still fascinated--simply because Tom Hanks' character is so unique and so memorable. His genteel humor and dialogue (which seems to come directly out of PhD theses on esoteric medieval literature, Rococo music theory and Edgar Allan Poe) and his portrayal of such is fascinating. Unfortunately, even that is not enough to carry the movie, as it loses focus and becomes mean-spirited about 3/4 though the movie.  After what appears to be an attempt at a quirky buddy-caper flick, about 3/4 through the robbers decide that it is necessary to kill their landlady. They are very serious about this. Suddenly things aren't funny anymore. Marlon Wayans' character gets killed in a struggle with the farting explosives expert after he attempts to kill the landlady. This is not funny. He is not killed in a funny way--- and why is there suddenly killing anyway, when the tone of the movie up to that point had been slapstick humor? They dump his body off a bridge onto a garbage barge going down the river. Not long afterwards, the Chinese general kills the explosives expert by choking him graphically with piano wire while he is farting. Apparently this is also supposed to be funny --- but is actually extremely not funny. It is sick and disturbing. They dump his body off the bridge onto a garbage barge going down a river. Soon after the Chinese general tries to kill the landlady and kills himself by accidentally falling down the stairs. Body to garbage barge. Tom Hanks tries to convince the football player to kill the landlady. He refuses, but accidentally shoots himself in the face with the gun while on the bridge. His body falls of it's own volition onto the garbage barge. This is extremely graphic, violent and not funny. Finally, a head of a gargoyle falls off the bridge and hits Tom Hanks on the head, and his body falls into the garbarge barge, too. Everyone's dead. The landlady keeps the money.   What's the point?  If it wasn't for the quirky performance Tom Hanks gave, this would have been a one-star for me.   Avoid it unless you're stuck on an airplane or are a big Tom Hanks fan. 
 I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour.  In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour.  Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again.  I find most of this album to be very average.  Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all.  The majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics.  There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably "Safe In New York City" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic.  Probably one of the bands weakest efforts 
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 Flavor is just passable. The cracker is too thick,& have not found a topping that will soften it.. 
 Type was too small for practical use in the kitchen. Ifound the chapter on equipment to be somewhat lacking by not discussing all alternatives such as the section on cutting boards only mentions one type and does not discuss the pros and cons of wood, glass, etc.  The tips are all pretty much the same tips and ideas I got from my first copy of "Joy of Cooking" 40 years ago.  The best, and certainly not the greatest, portion of the book was the recipes.  Several were very good 
 i find the book too advance to understan 
 I would never have bought this movie for myself - I think the movie is lame.  I borrowed it from my nephew to see it and a friend "borrowed" and never returned it.  I just bought it because I owed my nephew the movie.  There were very few original funny moments in it 
 This is without a doubt one of the most boring books I have ever read.  You need to take notes to understand it.  It is very disjointed; it feels like a bunch of different chapter articles bound together in book form. It deals with a fascinating subject; it is a pity that it was not better written because it could have been an excelent book.  This may be the fault of the editor rather than the writer; she certainly needed some expert help with making her chapters fit together in a cohesive manner 
 I read these 5 star reviews and the synopsis and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I like odd. I read the first few pages/chapters and thought it was "different", but kept waiting to be taken away to a dreamland carnaval. I forced myself to keep going, thinking it was just a slow-starter but I was never seduced like the other reviewers. Very interesting premise, but I was quite disappointed 
 After reading his last few book with "co-authors" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the "co-author". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves 
 Being a Cussler fan for quite some time, having a first edition hardcover of "Raise the Titanic", I dutifully purchase and read every Cussler, and Cussler collaberated, piece of fiction and non-fiction. This title is a predictable read with only the names and places changed from previous reads to protect the innocent. Granted it's interesting and all that, and some of the scientific stuff is momentarily thought provoking, but in the end you already know the story  Bad guy going to take over the world, world in enviromental danger, good guy gets girl, car chase and everybody saved. Maybe I'm just in a cranky mood today, but thats what I think of it, and I'll probably buy the next one 
 For all you aspiring artist out there SAVE YOUR MONEY. This book does little to further any critical thought about the contemporary art world. The book is limited in the mediums represented, and seems more to be a platform for Linda Weintraub to promote artists that appeal to her than to critically discuss the issues aspiring artists face 
 Imagine a couple of interesting concepts wrapped in enough ridiculous minute details and pointless characters. Or don't imagine it and read this book 
 Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book 
 I had to listen to this CD as part of my job as a music reviewer for a Florida newspaper.  It's unfortunate to see a generation of sax players such as this guy who are more concerned with appearance than substantive playing.  This music is all about fluff and ultimately says nothing.  Having seen Dave in concert both as a lead man and a side man it is clear he has some sort of need to be in the limelight but when gets there has nothing to say.  I'm not knocking all contemporary players mind you.  There are guys like Jeff Kashiwa and Eric Marienthal that manage to play in the contemporary idiom and don't resort to trivial, fluffy playing 
 The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film 
 Let me start by saying that the diet works.  I lost 40 lbs over three years ago, I feel great and I look great.  The cookbook is one of the worst cookbooks I have ever bought.  A few of the recipes are good, but most were dreadful.  Titles like "Cauliflower and Peas in Yogurt" and "Brussel Sprouts With Curry" are about as tasty as they sound.  It's the only cookbook I have used where I have baked an entire dinner only to throw it away.  It's happened a few times, so now I don't use this book.  Look elsewhere for good, low glycemic-index recipes using non-processed food and flax oil....  
 Somebody call Queens of the Stone Age and tell them that Death From Above stole their equipment ... and their licks. Is there room for another QOTSA? Probably. What I'm wondering is why this isn't found all over cheeseball commercial radio stations. But then, this isn't quite the adolescent, swoon-inducing caterwaul of, say, sickly sweet dollboys Fall Out Boy or the faux-heavy attention-spanless swill of mascara-dowsed cherubs Hawthorne Heights. Death From Above, while not at all mind-expanding, truly is heavy and heavy is not light, and light is bright and bright light breeds happy thoughts and happy thoughts are a preteen girl's wet dream. So, while it's a perfect match for formaldehyde-smoking jocks and tuba-sized bong-owning dropouts, it doesn't quite fly with the doll-collecting crowd. And who knows, I haven't seen what the band members look like; maybe they all have buckteeth, receding hairlines and crossed eyes and that's why they didn't get a TRL invite. 
 While this book contains a ton of data, don't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade.  If you look up french toast, for example, it only gives information on name brand items.  Much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products.  I suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping, or use it before eating out, it would be helpful.  But if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items, you are out of luck with this book 
      My major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires. These extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u-v lamp, vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin, and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun. Vampires are supposed to be scary, but how frightened of them should I be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him. Writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable. The first Underworld movie would be a good model.                                 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 I give James Bradley much credit for making this important, though unpalatable, story better known.  We need to realize that as human beings, Americans are not significantly better or worse than most others, especially when tested by the extremes of war.  However, Bradley's basic writing skills, as evidenced in this book, are not appropriate to an important historical volume.  He jumps back and forth between between ordinary colloquialisms and formal historical style.  He uses the first names of historical figures ("Curtis" for LeMay).  Some of his descriptions of firestorm effects are much overdrawn and unrealistic. There are internal contradictions.  He frequently uses sarcasm, which is completely inappropriate for a serious work of history.  It is most unfortunate that his poor writing has much diminished the contribution that this book could have made.  Further, a great annoyance is the word "Flyboys".  I lived through WWII, and my older brothers were in the Pacific theater throughout. One was a naval air crewman, who flew many missions over Japan.  In those days, I do not recall ever hearing the word "flyboys" used to describe any of our own or the enemy's air personnel.  I find the word sarcastic and derogatory 
 I am glad that this was a birthday gift and not something I had to spend my own money on. SpongeBob collects alot of dirt quickly and the pieces do NOT stay in very well. As far as the obscene gesture...I can understand why some people may be turned off by it. My 2 year old who LOVES SpongeBob pays no attention to it 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 I don't know why the recipes in this book don't turn out right.  Every recipe I tried has been a disaster, not to mention required an extremely expensive list of ingredients (porcini mushrooms and arugula anyone?).  Jamie Oliver puts on a great show, but the food just doesn't seem to live up to the "easy peasy" hype. His "My favorite curry" with "Lemon rice" took almost 3 hours from prep to finish and tasted horrible.  I won't be buying another Jamie Oliver book 
 Idiocracy  It's fair to compare Mike Judge's Office Space to his latest film, Idiocracy, because both movies approach their subjects from a position of satire.  I argue that Office Space is far more successful due to a smarter script, a great cast, excellent soundtrack, and sympathetic characters.  While Office Space tells an intelligent and funny tale, Idiocracy is a morality comedy with one running joke - the world is getting dumber.  It's a boring, tired joke that doesn't get any funnier the more Judge tells it.  In the end, Idiocracy is professional wrestling for people with master's degrees.  Before listing grievances, I should write that I generally agree with Judge's assessment of the United States and the world at large.  Instead of being used wisely to advance humanity, media has been engaged as a weapon to wage war against ideas and experimentation, and used to promote emotional conservation of the status quo.  Unthinking idiots who gather around the idiot box every evening are complicit in this downward spiral.  I will also admit that I liked Judge's assertion that the average person today can make a difference, but that one must take a risk and lead.  The world, left to the idiots, will inevitably become worse.  Finally, the movie has helped me to decide to cancel my cable television subscription tomorrow.  The only new shows I watch anymore are The Daily Show and The Colbert Report.  I don't watch all of the good and rare movies that air every night on TMC.  I watch re-runs of cartoon shows that I have seen a million times.  I don't read books often enough.  Instead, I spend too many nights watching terrible documentaries on the prison system.  I cannot continue this mindless existence.  I also cannot credit Idiocracy with all of my motivation to leave mainstream media - I've known that something had to change for a while now - but the movie made what I already knew more urgent, demanding immediate changes.  You might wonder why I gave the film a low score if I found that it positively affected my life.  First and foremost, the movie is dumb and doesn't trust the viewer to "get it" without overwhelmingly heavy-handed sight gags and so-called dialogue.  This is utterly ironic, because the film is trying to teach the viewer to look more critically at the world, to question why intelligence, challenges, and knowledge are being shunted in favor of the cheapest, most melodramatic, and instant of gratifications.  The most complete irony, however, is that the film does to its audience what it claims contemporary culture does to us now: It appeals to our emotions instead of our minds.  There's nothing intellectually engaging or thought-provoking about this film.  The movie consists entirely of fears you have already considered, and so the film's only function is to reinforce biases.  Perhaps Judge is playing a joke on those who think this film is profound.  It wouldn't be the first time.  Beavis and Butthead ridiculed its audience WHILE they were watching it.  It was brilliant.  I have a feeling, though, that Judge simply misfired with Idiocracy 
 I didn't realize I was ordering a miniature of the book and would like too return them.  Can I 
 I haven't read any of the real Robert Ludlum before, but I don't think I will be starting if this is his style. The action scenes, with their falling chandeliers and mexican shootouts, are perhaps better suited to a 90 minute movie instead of a 400 page book. The weapons-catalogue padding is comical at first, later frustrating. The childishly cliched language is little help in distinguishing the myriad of characters and places. We know only the color of their hair before they are mercifully laid to rest. Perhaps most disturbing is the book's overall 1950's style racism  in which the Americans are dashing, multi-skilled warriors for good and the Russians, Ukrainians, even Germans are all ugly, inhuman or quickly dead. Whilst the premise for the story is promising and the plot is simple but water-tight, the reader is always a step-ahead of the characters. As other reviews have said, suspense and mystery are left absent 
 This book was simply not up to Baldacci's usual quality.  The story goes all over the place, but doesn't get anywhere until the last 50 pages.  Even after 200, 300, and even 400 pages we are still chasing dead ends and no closer to figuring out where this thing is going.  I don't mind suspense, but you can stay "suspended" only so long until it becomes boredom.  The main character is the worst one Baldacci has ever created.  One minute she is crying her eyes out, and puking her guts out totally paralyzed by fear, and the next minute she is tracking down trained bad guys and saving the lives of the inept FBI agents and police.  This is repeated throughout the story.........I would think she had worn out all the emotional crap by the end of the book.  She makes one blunder after another resulting in the deaths of innocent people, but at the same time comes up with brilliant deductions that help her stay one step ahead of the mastermind killers.  By the end of the book I found myself pulling for the sadistic killer to finally finish this stupid [...] off.    This is one of those books to keep next to the bed in case you are having trouble sleeping. 
 I got this phone basically for free, but even taking that into account, I'm pretty disappointed with the phone. This is my first Samsung and, I'm pretty sure, my last one! I owned a Nokia before and I regret that I "betrayed" it. From now I wouldn't get anything besides Nokia and in the worst case maybe Sony-Ericsson. So here is a short list of those "little things" that make your life, with this phone (and it's combination with T-Mobile), annoying: - the keys are not comfortable to use. - it's not really comfortable to open/close the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time. - putting a comma, while writing a text message, capitalizes the next word - what is the logic in that?! (it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot) - you can't set the camera shutter to be silent... - you can only save 1 phone type for each category - what if the person has 2 business phones... - you cannot choose the e-mail address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an e-mail address.  And there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through, like it would've been in a Nokia (even in a model 5 years old!)  Oh yeah, and T-Mobile really "contributed" to the "greatness" of this phone, removing some of the features and limiting others, like setting your mp3 as a ringtone (although, there is an easy hack around it: just change the extension from .mp3 to .3gp 
 This book may be helpful for some people who want to know more about possible conspiracies. Personally, I believe some of them; but that's not why I purchased this book. This book is highly misrepresented on Trudeau's infomecials. There are no specific recommendations for treatment of any illnes in this book. Only some vague references to start you on a paper chase. There is not even an index in the book to direct you to information on a specific illness. This book is basically another infomercial for his subscription website. 
 I like a few other readers was excited to start this book after reading so many great reviews... what were they all thinking?? This book was so boring and the back and forth between then and now was painstakingly slow. The main character was so unlikable, as a child and as an adult. Her fascination with her brother Matt, was not fully explained, and really all the characters could have been written better. The layout of the book I also felt was badly edited. I literally had to force myself to finish it because I figured I'd already spent so much of my time I figured I had to know the end. What a let down.... I found it way to corny and anti-climatic. Seriously, if you're on the fence about this one, keep on searching. Leave this book alone, you'll be doing yourself a favor 
 This movie is just so tragically non-believable, that it irritates the viewer and you have to quit on it.   Good cast, but what stupidity in the script. Are they serious letting us believe that a serial killer is re-enacting crimes from an almost 100-year old novel.  And so Angelina Jolie goes to a decades abandoned meatpacking storehouse and can still smell the manure??????  Duhhh --- the place has been abandoned for decades. More non-believably, you mean to tell me a real estate developer hasn't snatched up the property and razed the building. That it has sat undisturbed so that even the manure is intact decades later?  I'm sorry -- when movies use plot devices so amateursishly like this, I bail on the whole project. 
 Well I hope Christ is nicer to Michael than Ronnie was. Ronnie once famously asked which one is mine when visiting Michael at camp, not knowing which of the boys was his adopted son. Presumably on the day of judgement Christ won't ask Michael "Which one are you?"... I've always cut Michael some slack despite his pandering conservative views and his seemingly insatiable thrist to milk his connection to his father for every last dime he can hustle. And in a way it is refreshing to see Michael still throwing himself at Ronnie's cowboy boots even after his passing. Then again there are still dollars to be made which brings us back to this book. The sob story presented here is not without genuine sobs, but I found it all a tad tragic that here is this abandonded boy still trying to win some acceptance from Dad - be it his earthly one or God - and that his method of winning that acceptance is to live on his knees instead of his own two feet. Hopefully Michael's next volume will be when he finds his own voice and his own manhood. 
 I came across McCarry after reading Mark Steyn's claim that he was another real ex-spook novelist and better than LeCarre.  Well, lots of things are better than recent LeCarre, but at least to judge by this book McCarry is a journeyman writer who doesn't come close to comparing to LeCarre in his prime.    Yes, his intelligence background lends surface realism to his descriptions of a hunt from one end of the world to the other-- the part set in a remote corner of China where Kafka meets Genghis Khan is especially convincing and amusing.  But too much of this covers standard airport novel stuff-- the old (by now very old) Nazi in South America, the way-too-much-to-swallow-mystery (which covers all the ground from ancient Judea to Osama bin Laden-- by way of Heydrich's Czechoslovakia!), the band of retirees assembled to solve it all who fall somewhere between Doc Savage's Fantastic Five and one of those aging-actor-work-program movies like The Wild Geese.  The real point is that McCarry is telling a plot-- a whopper of one-- and can only tell it by sending his main character from one part of the world to the next where, conveniently, someone who we are told will tell him nothing promptly tells him everything.  LeCarre, on the other hand, uses the dilemmas of spying to explore character.  The mystery in Tinker, Tailor could hardly be smaller (one's a mole, which one is it?) yet it's vitally involving.  The mystery in Old Boys could hardly be bigger yet it's-- oh, that old thing again.  Whatever 
 This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it. If one wants to find deep meaning or spirituality, one will find it -- extracting meaning from each picture, each word, each pause. But, I don't know. I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead.. 
 This book is a tormented stream of consciousness from a lady who was obviously fighting major demons.  It is exactly the type of book that you would expect an amateur academic to "wow" and "gush" over, as it nicely fits into the dogmatic radicalism of Chicano Studies.  The discerning reader, on the other hand, sees page after page of outdated cliches, sob-stories, and anger-filled tantrums.  Anzaldua would like you to believe her suffering and self-searching  is all the fault of the "white" culture encroaching upon the enlightened cosmic race of the mestiza.  She'd like you to think that her mestiza/chicana/lesbian/female identity is the sole cause of her misfortune and hardship.   What becomes overwhelmingly evident upon reading her unabashed torrent of decadent self-pity is the learned and self-enforced quality of her "opression".   Anzaldua helplessly wallows in her romantic fatalism dreaming of the great mestiza revolution that will fix all of the world's problems by turning the middle class value system upside down.  If you like romantic literature, and enjoy the hopeless and sorrowful ramblings of society's self-marginalized, I might suggest "The Sorrows of the Young Werther" by Goethe or some poems by Lord Byron - at least then you get some literary value 
 As usual, this book ignores the 16-20 million non Jewish victims of the holocaust. This is very disappointing. The holocaust is not exclusively to Jews-as historians have portrayed it. What about the 7 million Ukraines? MIllions of Polish, prisoners of war, crippled, handicapped...I guess historians view their lives as less valuable 
 The first unit I got wouldn't charge the ipod nor would the cd player read any cd's.  Called iLuv tech support on the weekend and got a message that mailbox was full try again later.  I returned it and got a second unit.  Once again, the cd player wouldn't read any cd's.  Tech support did answer this time when I called during office hours 8-5pm EST.  But could offer no solution.  Return it a second time and I won't purchase it again 
 The first sentence in the book is "People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I realized I could understand the way animals think."  It should have been "People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I SOMEHOW GOT THE NOTON THAT I could understand the way animals think." There's no proof in this book, no good evidence, just Ms. Grandin's anecdotes and speculations.   Noticing a lot of detail because you have autism and being able to use this ability to design humane slaughterhouses does not translate into thinking like animals think.  The book does offer many clear, simple descriptions of scientists' research. So if you don't know anything about animal research, these descriptions could be a good place to start. 
 The box and inside materials say that metal utensils can be used, but after a single use my metal spatula created deep grooves all over the surface.  The pan was ruined.  Very disappointed 
 The whole game is very poor quality. The spinner is made of cheap plastic and comes apart when spun. You have to apply number stickers to the die. Instructions too confusing for the age group.  Very Disappointed 
 This movie doesn't even deserve a *star*. Lousy movie.......instead of Lost Junction, it should be called LOST TIME 
 This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.  Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning.  Nor does it have anything else.  "Interactive Menus" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.    Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from 
 and it holds up just as well today. in the past few years, the market has been flooded with wrestling-themed albums, mostly containing 30 seconds of generic entrance music stretched out 3 or 4 minutes to create a "song". at least these are "real" songs, which is about the best you can say for them. of the originals, the only keepers are jimmy harts suprisingly catchy "rick springfield" and the absurd yet moronically toe tapping "capt lou's history of music". as for the covers, hearing nikolai volkoff sing cara mia is worth a snicker or two, but not more than that, and mean gene singing at all is embarrassing (although not as bad as his "rock & roll hoochie koo" off the wrestling album II, barely). all the wrestlers chip in on "land of 1000 dances", although i cant quite remember if the original boasted the lyrics "i'm gonna rap you with my cane, you pencil neck geek" or "i'm gonna crush you with my avalanche". the in between song patter between okerland, mcmahon, & ventura is for the most part stilted and unfunny. please, i abhor you, spend your hard earned money on something a little better 
 There is some good biographical information in this book if you are interested in Gordon B. Hinckley.  However, much of this biography is about the Mormon church and the role he played in it.    Gordon B. Hinckley, as stated in the book, got his big opportunity to impress his uppities by trying to help Mormon boys avoid the draft and the fighting in Korea (insert national anthem here).  Since missionary work took precedence over the fight against communism (let others die for their country), a concerted effort was made to try to keep Mormon boys from having to serve.    Appointed to the big twelve in the early 60's, Gordon mostly spent his time marketing for the church.  He played important roles in battling "liquor by the drink" in Utah and stopping the ratification of the "Equal Rights Amendment."  He also filled in for senile prophets when their capacity to rule declined.    If you are into suffering from congenital disciplitis, this book is for you, though there are probably more dynamic leaders out there who might give you more wisdom for the money you shell out to be in Gordon's inner sanctum.    And I say this in the name of Sonia Johnson, amen.  
 I can't comment on this one because it was lost on delivery twice along with the other two purchased items. It's a real bizzard 
 This book is lewd, blasphemous & obscene. It is wicked, indecent, unnatural, immoral, filthy, bawdy, and an offense to public morals 
 I have read all buy 1, and felt this was the weakest.  It was still good, but lacked in a lot of ways.... 
 While this book advertises that it will make ECG interpretation "easy", it does provide the proper graphics to make this possible.  The first few chapters of the book are accessible and the end of chapter quizzes are helpful.  However, once you get to Chapter 3"Interpreting a Rhythm Strip", the strips are impossible to interpret due the small size of the strips!  You need to be able to count the boxes to interpret the rhythms and this is virtually impossible, unless you have a large magnifying glass!  I thought this might be one occurrence in the book, but it is throughout, making interpretation of strips near impossible!  As a novice ECG person, this is not something that I would have looked for before purchasing the book.  Other ECG interpretation books have much better graphics of the strips, making interpretation (while still not "easy") doable, and not frustrating 
 Briefly, I have four stations and they never really worked right, I presume because of the need to be on the same circuit. I want to replace them now but I'm not sure I'd buy this brand again. 
 TOO BORING TO GO ANY FURTHER THAN THE FIRST SEVERAL CHAPTERS. I THUMBED THROUGH THE REST AND SAW IT WAS ALL THE SAME. NOT REALLY A PERSONAL CONFESSIONAL-SHE MENTIONS HER PROCEDURES VERY BRIEFLY. IT INSTEAD READS LIKE TEXTBOOK MEDICAL HISTORY OF THE ORIGINS OF PLASTIC SURGERY. IF YOUR ANYONE WHO HAS HAD, OR IS PLANNING TO HAVE ANY SURGERY OR INJECTIONS, SKIP THIS BOOK-UNLESS YOU WANT TO READ ABOUT SOLDIERS WHO WERE DISFIGURED AND MAMED DURING WAR SO PLASTIC SURGERY WAS BORN. ALONG THOSE SAME LINES, I DID NOT WANT TO READ IN EXCRUTIATING DETAIL ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THE "POISON" BOTOX AND HOW IT WAS ORIGINALLY FOUND AND DEVELOPED FROM ROTTEN SAUSAGES. THE STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE SHE ACTUALLY KNEW ARE SHORT AND SO COMPLETELY OFF THE WALL FROM WHAT ANY NORMAL WOMAN WOULD EVER WANT TO DO ARE USELESS TO READ ABOUT AS WELL. UNLESS YOU ARE RESEARCHING FOR REFRENCE THE STATISTICS AND ORIGIN OF PLASTIC SURGERY-SKIP THIS BOOK 
 This book was boring; it was a chore to finish. It takes place in Glamorous Hollywood, a bit too glamorous for me. The main character, a lawyer, has a boyfriend she's not too happy with. This book has too many boring pages. This is definitely the last book by this author that I will ever read 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 If you're looking for a new take on the Victorian Christmas ghost story (as this novel claims to be), well, this may not be the book for you.  Palliser takes his time setting up this tale, in which the ghosts are more figurative than anything else.  The first 200 pages or so are filled with plot lines that seem to go nowhere and tales that have you moving from the 9th to the 17th to the 19th centuries.  Quite confusing, and, frankly, rather dull.  Had this been a short story, it would be quite good, but as a nearly 400 page novel it is simply tedious 
 After enjoying his first book, Term Sheets and Valuations, I was looking forward to this one.  I regret to say that I found it a big waste of time and a bigger waste of money.    It appears as if the marketing of the book by the pblisher sought to take advantage of his first book by raising the price by 500%, giving the impression that this book was better or more comprehensive.  However, nothing could be further from the truth.  
 This is the shortest book I failed to finish. I'm sorry, but for a short novel, it was just got too wordy and touchy-feely for me. I loved Emperor of the Air, a collection of short stories in which feelings and places were described succintly. And the events happened at a quicker pace. But in Blue River, Canin stretches out all his descriptions of places, of main character's resentments, disappointments, fears, and memories. It really feels tedious to read and halfway through it, I just had to give up 
 And stop there.  Because it's all downhill after that 
 When the title of your book is "Confirmation: The Hard Evidence of Aliens Among Us" it would probably be a good idea to produce some hard evidence. This book is the loosest of innuendo; the shakiest of suppositions; and probably hurts more than helps the UFO movement. The so-called "hard evidence" - the shards of foreign materials found in a few people are classified as alien, even though not one of them is of a foreign substance not found in nature. I love a good UFO tale, but this book proves absolutely nothing and isn't even a provocative read. Whitley has completely milked the alien abduction genre, and I'm sure he's not done... It's been too profitable 
 Evolution was one of the most hyped albums back in 1997 my sophomore year of high school. Naturally I rushed out to get the album and on my first listen I found the album to be weak, especially the fast tracks. Seven years later I re-bought the album and gave it another listen; as an adult I found the album to be stronger than I thought. Boyz II Men like Jodeci before them have always been the strongest with ballads and this is apparent on the singles Doin Just Fine,Never,4 Seasons Of Loneliness. Shawn's writing skills were apparent on the song Doin Just Fine which is one of the strongest songs on the album, however there's is a lot of weak material on the album. Songs such as Girl In The Life Magazine, Baby C'mon and To The Limit all seem forced and aren't song with that much heart. In my opinion truly evolved on their EXCELLENT fourth disc Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya. 
 I hate the fact that I shop at Wal-Mart. But they offer the lowest prices and I need to save every penny I have living in this horrible economy where the rich get all the tax breaks and I'm left with nothing. Wal-Mart makes up for it's low prices by giving their employees a low pay check and having tax payers pay for their medical. My neighbor works and Wal-Mart. She does it because she has no place else to go. And she has a child she has to support so if she loses her job she will be in a very bad situation. Wal-Mart is a horrible horrible cancer on this world and one day it's going to kill us all.   Oh, and Wal-Mart stores are total dumps. With the amount of money the company has you'd think they could pay a few extra people some money to clean the place up. But we all know why they don't, don't we? Because that would mean Wal-Mart paying for more employees when they know they can just force the ones they got into working overtime without pay 
 I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk 
 For the last 2 years I have listened to about 1 audio book per week and this takes first place as the worst of the lot. The exercises in this audio book are trivial and insulting. Save your money 
 I'm really surprised the authors became so famous as the new gurus of CRM or 1to1 marketing. This book is just a collection of superficial case studies but it says nothing on the technologies used, the real problems companies had to face when they implemented CRM programs. This is just a book for high school kids or sunday newspaper readers who want know more about CRM without getting into the details. Not worth the money and absolutely simplistic 
 After reading this book, I would have to say Michael Apple did a wonderful job using examples to describe how modern public schools in the United States are flawed. He also did a good job introducing ideas, which might have been alien to many people, regarding elements of public education in America. However, it seems he spends too much time on the tautology of blaming Republicans for the misfortunes and pratfalls of present pedagogy. One must remember that Democrats and Republicans are both cut from the same cloth. In addition, if Apple wants to scream bloody murder about how many blemishes that Republicans have caused public education, he needs to remember that Democrats really have not made it any better. The "No Child Left Behind" act is something that both the left and the right support, and after working in public education for over a year, I can tell you this act really does not work.  Apple does explain notions of Channel One and product placement in public schools, which then dictates curriculum. He also goes into detail about how the media influences education and contemporary society. Nevertheless, he spends more time pointing fingers and telling you what is wrong. However, he never expresses any lucid or tangible means to ameliorate this quagmire facing our youth and public education.   There is a fine line between making a wonderful argument and whining like a baby. Apple does a great job performing the latter. Mind you, Republicans are not perfect politicians by any stretch of the imagination. Just look at some of the things that have happened over the past few years. Yet, Apple's diatribe seems more like whimpering, instead of fighting back, or addressing a solution to all the things, he is complaining about. Overall, this is an interesting read, but Apple is nowhere near the philosophical icon of John Dewey.   
 The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them. It teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well, and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy. I love that this book comes in boardbook form, but I am very dissapointed with the illustrations 
 Atheists have a lower divorce rate than born again christians but I guess thats just a fluke hu, Ann. They must be bad people somehow. People like Ann can't be christians because they shame one person for having an affair and then forgive another that is an alcoholic because he's a republican. She speaks to people who want to believe so bad they don't care that she doesn't have a christian bone in her body. True christians don't defame, judge or claime superiority. She doesn't have any idea of what being Jesus-like is. Oh and intelligent design is not science. Science is how Religion is why- They are too different questions 
 When I bought this book and the software for front page I had never created a website, was not at all familiar with computer programming but was quite familiar with the Microsoft Office Suite.  The great thing about front page is that you do not need to know anything about computer programming to use it.  I don't think the author caught wind of that...  I tried to read the book to get started on a web page but it made absolutely no sense.  Then, I tried the free tutorials on the Microsoft website.  They were extremely informative and since then I have been able to make many great looking webpages.  I went back to my book to see if it made any sense to me now that I have a better understanding of Frontpage and I still have no clue about what is going on in that book 
 I have been a Dean Koontz fan for years. When he is at his best, heis books are VERY good. I used to think that even when he's formulaic, at least his books are always entertaining. Recently, I've had to reevaluate him. He can write books that are bad. I was disappointed by "The Taking", and now this... I've been listening to this as an audiobook, but now I'm turning it off. I usually don't write reviews on books or films I don't finish, but this one, I had to give up and feel abliged to warn others.   I made it almost halfway through the book, waiting for something to happen. I really don't care to know how the story ends because it's hardly started yet. There are several parallel plots, all overwritten, with long portions of text where nothing happens and too many characters that feel not realistic, but constructed to be likeable and/or funny. I've always liked the way Koontz writes characters you really get to know and care about, but this time it's way too overdone. They can't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves and have endless dialogues that doesn't move the plot forward. Something must happen for a book to be interesting.  I was a big fan but I'm going to be very cautious about his books in the future. I'm not going to waste more time on this one. Not recommended even (or perhaps especially) for Koontz fans. 
 I have read all the books in the Midnite Louie series, and this one was definitely my least favorite.  Maybe because I was never an Elvis fan, but I just didn't find all the Elvis trivia and impersonator stuff interesting. Like several other readers, finishing the book was a chore, not really a pleasure like usual. I hope the next book gets back on track 
 Shouldn't you  people know by now?Say it with me:NEVER BUY MOVIE GAMES.A friend of mine bought it and it was horrible.It was way too easy to die in,etc,etc,etc.Hey listen.Keep you money.Your investment isn't in here 
 Well here we have it - a book AGAINST the age of progress. This guy is FOR keeping PARALYZED PEOPLE PARALYZED. This guy is FOR KEEPING AMPUTEES AMPTUTATED. This is guy is for KEEPING DEPRESSED SUICIDAL PEOPLE DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL. Its because of this attitude that neoluddites like this cannot win 
 If you'd like to enter Dennett's Fantasy Land of self-satisfied, materialist reduction then this is the book for you.  If, however, you're looking for a work by a philosopher who can critically examine and defend his own theories and presuppositions then this book will probably strike you as a monumental waste of time.  To be sure, Dennett knows how to construct arguments -- the problem is that they're question-begging arguments.  And unless you share Dennett's materialist presuppostions you're going to find almost every page of this book filled with question-begging naivet.  Dennett, of course, has his reasons.  He claims that Cartesian Mind-Body dualism leads to unsolvable problems, hence we should resolve such dualism in favor of the tanglible Body and think like good (that is, consistent) materialists.  (And never mind philosophy prior to Descartes -- especially Aristotle, for whom the word "body" necessarily implies an informing and organizing "soul" or "form".  Such a "form" is, in Aristotle's account, precisely the reason why bodies are organized and not simply inchoate matter.  But never mind all that.  Dennett isn't really interested in the history of philosophy, the meanings of words, or an opponent that isn't a straw-man.)  But, despite Dennett's insistence on materialist consistency, the book is plagued by an inconsistent double-think which brings back the Mind-Body problem in its full force.  We have (or seem to have) immediate experience of our own minds or consciousness.  Dennett encourages us to reductively translate such experiences into neural processes.  The problem is, that we have experiences without being directly aware of the neural processes that are correlated to them.  That is, what we experience is not a neural process.  We infer the neural process and assume its correlation to what we experience.  Hence, the correlation of a particular neural process to a particular experience is purely speculative or hypothetical -- or at least it's speculative and hypothetical when Dennett doesn't simply present such correlation as a dogmatic belief.  Such dubious correlation calls into question the validity of the Mind's reduction to (or "translation" into) the Body.  If such translation is purely hypothetical or speculative, then Dennett hasn't moved one step beyond Mind-Body dualism (his materialist rhetoric notwithstanding).  Or put it this way.  I have an experience.  Someone may use MRI to try to determine what neural processes occur during my experience.  That person is not going to know the contents of my experience (or mind).  For that, he or she needs to rely on my own immediate or immanent account of my experience.  In other words, the observer of my neural processes simply grafts my own immanent account of consciousness onto those neural processes and assumes their correlation.  Dennett apparently fails to see that such a procedure assumes the immanent validity of a Mind's immediate self-experience (contra materialism) and that he himself relies on this assumption in order to attribute significance to the observed neural processes.    Basically, Dennett tells us that ordinary ideas about the mind or consciousness are naive.  He then proposes to replace our supposedly mistaken ideas with his own naive and question-begging ideas about Mind-Body correlation.  Bottom line: don't waste your time with this book 
 OK -- I should start out by saying I'm not a college student. I'm a 44-year-old who's always struggled with my weight and read just about every diet book ever written.  So, although much of the advice is good, I've seen almost all of it before. But I think what bugged me most is that the book is very repetitious and padded -- she gives the same tips and the same "Friends" and "Foes" food lists over and over, and if there's one thing that drives me nuts, it's a padded book!  There's lots of white space and big colored blocks, too.  The useful info could have been condensed down to about 25 pages.  Also, I think some of her natural/ herbal rememdies are bogus.  Echinacea was recently proven to be absolutely worthless in fighting colds -- and I think those test results were printed over a year ago, before this book went to press.  She also makes magical claims for grapefruit and herbal teas, none of which I think are true.  I'm surprised that a doctor's daughter would include this stuff.  The upshot: maybe if you're a college student, suddenly have a weight problem for the first time in your life, and don't know what the h--- to do about it, this book will be helpful to you.  But if you're a lifelong hardcase dieter like me, you can probably skip it!  I found "French Women Don't Get Fat" and "Food Cop" (by Yolanda Bergman) more helpful 
 The collection of stories in this anthology are pitiful not horrific.  This book opens with 90 pages of an intro that provides a chronology of "events" for the genre for the year.  An absolute waste of paper and ink.  Neither interesting nor relevant to a good horror story.  Finally the book opens with the first of "The Best New Horror", a triffling werewolf story that left me wanting.  Better stories are told by 6-year olds.  But I had faith and kept reading and was further disappointed by the quality of the stories that followed.  Don't waste your time, your money or your shelf space.  This book is not worth any of them 
 I picked up this book thinking it would be an elegant blend of science, history and philisophical musings a la Lewis Thomas--but Barnett has failed utterly. He shifts from psuedo-philisophical ponderings to sounding as though he's lecturing to a bunch of college freshman. I can't possibly give it a one star because I did find a lot of the information interesting, but on the whole, I put down the book rather dissatisfied 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry 
 After Dark's "Horrorfest" as they titled it was only a horror fest because almost every movie in this set was not at all what you were promised.   There really is no "Too Shocking for general audiences"! The shock actually comes from the fact that most of these lackluster movies actually made it on to the silver screen.  After Dark is Lion's Gate's red headed stepchild, it took a hell of a blow releasing these, Lion's gate saw opportunity to make money, it marketed these films completely under false pretense and cashed in while audience members we're left unhappy and ripped off.  the only good ones with any decent content we're The Gravedancers, and Reincarnation, every other one with the exception of the Abandoned (which i saw twice) was a true borefest.  Penney Dreadful being number one as far as bad filmmaking goes.  i truly do i hope people listen, but for those that don't after you're done, write your own review. 
 I read Cast Two Shadows by Ann Rinaldi in my history class. I had much trouble getting through this book because of the unique writing style and Carolines vague descriptions of things. If I could read this book again, I would not because I did not enjoy it much at all 
 What a pile of vapid tripe. Reading this book actually lowered my IQ. I quess I could've felt stupider, I could've actually paid for this book. If the overexcessive use of the terms "darling", "amazing", and "delicious" don't give you the douche-chills, then you might actually be able to plod your way through this refuse without wanting to take a hot iron to each of the characters' faces. Anyone who likes this vacuous load of landfill fodder probably thinks that Paris Hilton is a great musician 
 I loved Starfish.  I appreciated the smart science (hey, gotta love SF with bibliographies!); I found the world riveting and the characters well-drawn.  But I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this book.  The sequence of sexual sadism, which stretches on for chapter after excruciating chapter, is simply too visually explicit to be worth experiencing.  It's an image I just didn't need, and one I can't get out of my head.  It includes an eroticized clitoridectomy, for goodness sake.  For me, that sequence overshadows everything else in the book, and however much you may want to see the resolution of issues raised in the other books, be sure you're willing to have that image stuck to your eyeballs before you buy or read this volume 
 First of all, this manga is NO GOOD, IT'S AWFULL!!! Before I read the book, I thought this book was going to follow the story from the game. Instead, it is rushed, the battle scenes are not detailed, and the plot is no good (Since it seems a lot of the story is missing). Although the art is good, it is MUCH better to play the game than reading this book. 
 I am also a longtime subscriber, and I am quite outraged at the new changes that have been made with the magazine. I have written a letter to the editor containing my list of grievances, if you will (I would hope they would be redressed but they will probably ignore me). Anyway, please read:  I am a current subscriber, and was quite suprised by Discover's new look (to all reading this review on Amazon.com: Amazon.com does NOT display the updated version of what Discover currently looks like). I didn't quite care for it, but as long as the material stayed the same I was going to be allright with it. Unfortunately, the articles in Discover have degenerated into "Top 20 things you didn't know about..." lists, piles of trivia, some sexual humor and editorializing on recent news. Sure, reading about gay astronauts may be a little humorous. Is it appropriate for what Discover stood for or what I have expected from this magazine? I would disagree. Occasionally there is an intelligent article. The cover story still seems up to par with the stories from the Old Discover. I really did once enjoy this magazine and it was the most expected item to arrive in my mailbox. I've kept all my copies from the last five years in the best condition I possibly could because I truly did enjoy reading them, and still do. Maybe this new Discover is for a "new generation" or meant to lure in younger or less mature readers, but I think the change in articles has taken a turn for the worse. I think the ordinary person, the "lay man" if you will, would appreciate at least intelligent articles about new, interesting and groundbreaking discoveries in the scientific community. I remember the String Theory article (I forget which issue exactly) as one of the most well-written articles on that topic.It was very exciting, and most importantly it [i]got me interested in the science[/i]. I doubt I will ever see anything that good from Discover magazine again. I'd really hate to give up on this magazine: all I ask is for the old Discover back. 
 The writing is pedestrian and the plot makes no sense.  I thought something might change, that it might become an interesting ghost story, or there might be moral issues, or maybe even a character would grow or change.  The heavy-handed ending is, perhaps, intended to demonstrate how the intense oppression and suppression of women in Amish culture forces them to violence against their loved ones...but that's a pretty heavy message for a book that seems full of meaninglessness.  Are we supposed to take everything that Ellie says about the Amish in court (peaceful, gentle, incapable of murder, loving, child-centric, willing to accept an out-of-wedlock child into the community) as lies?  The ending belongs to a much darker book.  My biggest complaint though is the bad writing and editing, I kept stumbling over inconsistencies and that always inhibits my enjoyment of a story.  
 All this is the instructions and qualifications for how to get PHR or SPHR certified.  I did not find it helpful at all for the price!  It does give a practice quiz (yes, just one) which I suppose is helpful but I would just go ahead and order prep materials and use those.  If you are nervous about standardized tests then I guess it's somewhat helpful because it goes in to how to take them and alotting your time...but if you are well-seasoned in them or any testing (as I am) then I would say don't bother 
 Does not show you techniques rather it just shows pictures!  After buying this book- I was very disappointed since I thought it will show me makeup tips and tricks, rather it just shows displays of women's faces.  You will waste your money on purchasing this book 
 I've been robbed.  I just spent $25 for this hard cover book, and now that I finished it - I feel like burning it! I feel like the authors have jerked me around, led me along so I spent my hard earned money on their three goldarned books - and for what?  Let me explain. When you start an alternative history book on any  era, you begin with a question.  "What would have happened if something had gone differently"  . Here the authors are free to pick from the hundreds of critical events and make a point of departure.  The authors choose a very interesting one. What if Lee have listened to Longstreets advice and made a massive flanking movement to the South at Gettysburg.  The first book of this trilogy covered these fictional events with not only a truely outstanding depth of knowlege of the era, but a breathtaking mastery of suspence and pacing. This was an adventure novel of the first water. A real page-turner with such detail that you felt you were present at actual events depicted in the book. Staying well within the bounds of the possible, it was utterly convincing - even to the knowledgeable reader.  The second novel was not quite as good as the first but it still had fire and held our interest well.  The end of the second novel left the Confederacy in possession of Baltimore - America's third largest city - with a large population (which about half were sympathitic to the Southern cause)and loaded with heavy industry and the technical craftsmen that the South so desperately needed. There was a major diplomatic initutive that won the French over to extending recognition to the Confederacy - there is even some exposition on the French Emperor deciding to dispatch not only troops but state-of-the-art sea going iron clad warships from the French Navy to aid the Confederates (and secure a firmer foot hold in Mexico, naturalmont).  There was an extensive dialogue with a leading Jewish intelectual in Baltimore where some broad hints were dropped about possible last ditch efforts to arm some of the Souths blacks to refil the depleated Confederate ranks.  The second novel ends August 22, 1963. We are left with all these interesting possibilities. All these interesting avenues for the alternate history author to explore.  I bought the third novel and rushed home to read it. As I turned the pages a growing sense of dread filled me - the authors were rushing things, closing off Confederate hopes with such obvious heavy handed partiallity.   You always see this near the end of a cheap potboiler - the bad guys, who have previously been masterful and clever, quite suddenly become increadibly stupid and make mistake after mistake, while the good guys, who have struggled all the way through the book to put two and two together, are suddenly geniuses and have ever possible break falls their way.  So it was with this book. You have a stupid and drunken Southerner assigned to oversee the vitally stategic B&O railroad main yard. The crafty (and openly partison to the North) yard superintendant not only delays critical Southen supplies and troop movements, he orchestrates a major campaign of sabotage and even sends one of his men to inform the Union forces of these  critical Confederate plans - all without getting caught or even suspected by those dim wit southerners.  You could tell it was all a set up from there, the sense of credibility is gone. Everything and I mean everything goes wrong for those darn rebels. Once the authors partisonship is out in the open, it is clear that history will be repeating itself here.  The third book ends with the South's ignoble defeat- now note this carefully - Lee surrenders on August 30, 1863.   THIS IS ONLY EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE SECOND NOVEL ! You get what I mean by the authors rushing things. And that, friends, is not only straining credibility, it throws it to the winds.   To use one typical example - the Noble Army of the Potomic which after its smashing defeat at Gettysburg took a full month to recover, somehow after an even more devistating defeat is able to rest, reorganize, resupply and move into position to attack Baltimore with 15,000 troops - after just 9 days - yea, right.   The pathetic Confederates, somehow have not managed to make any improvements to Baltimore's existing fortificatins, can not seem to even delay a daylight amphibious landing, nor do they fight house to house nor deploy mobile artillery to delay the advance. On the other hand, the dashing Union calvalry, storms into Frederick, and in 3 hours whips up a bomb train to take out a stone bridge, while the stupid Confederates, who have been in full possession of Baltamore for a month, can not round up enough gunpowder to blow up a similar bridge. Thus Baltimore not only falls with hardly a shot, the entire infrastructure is intact!!??!!. Wow, what a break for the good guys ;-)   This third book is a not just a total disapointment - it is a rip-off. Having raised all these interesting ideas and giving the South two absolutely smashing (if hard faught) victories - the authors whip out the climax - the totally collapse of the Southern armies like a cheap tent in just one week.  In case anyone has forgotten, even without those smashing victories and the possession of the critical city of Baltimore, the South managed to fight on - dispite General Grants best efforts until 1865 !  This book was a cruel disappointment. There was no follow up of all the interesting ideas raised in the second book. It seems like the authors lost interest and just slapped together a jury rigged ending to please the house.  Yep - the good guys won, (yawn).  One had hoped for more courage and intelectual honesty from the authors 
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 I am one of a growing number that find Larkin lame and flaccid. You read, you understand, you move on. There is little to struggle over, nothing one wishes to reread. Simple poems of a lost England 
 Do you think if I wrote some nursery rhyme lyrics from bizzaro world and starting singing in a voice more suited to Sesame Street that I could get a record contract too like Devendra Banhart? His record has to be some kind of inside joke, or the efforts of one seriously untalented individual. Sprouting nonsensical phrases one after the other might pass as genius among some people but I want a bit more substance to my music. I found this record personally insulting because it's obvious that someone out there felt you can just put out any old crap filled with "strange and fantastic" lyrics that are ultimately meaningless and people would evitably go out and buy it because it's 'unique' and that your uncool if you don't get 'it' (whatever 'it' is). If you want to listen to a quality record by a singer-songwriter than go check out Bright Eyes' "I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning" or Damien Rice's "O" and steer clear of this insult to good taste 
 I have little to add to what's already been said by other reviewers other than I can't believe she seriously holds these views.  I admit that I only read parts of the book while at the bookstore, but no one who is educated, and I presume she is, can really think that evolution is unproven.  You might as well say that the Earth is flat, or square, or whatever.  She writes this drivel because it targets the far-right and gives them what they want.  Apparently this works because she churns out this trash about once a year 
 I gave this to my fiance for Christmas, who loves Sudoku and video games, so I thought it would be a brilliant combination.  He was excited, but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play.  He can't always tell where the cursor is on the board, so if he sets it down for a minute, he can't see where's he's left off.  Then when he was playing in the semi-dark while we were on a train, he couldn't see anything either (backlight would be a nice feature).  It just seems this model is not designed very intuitively: he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number, but it clears the game.  all that to say, 2 million puzzles sounds great...unless it's too frustrating to play 
 The analysis of the housing bubble in this book does not go beyond what is found in the general press.  Save your money!  We were looking for regional analysis of the housing bubble, likely scenarios as to how the housing bubble will correct, and how the correction will effect different housing segments (condos, started home, high end properties, etc.).  
 "The Biggest Game in Town" is a book exploring the lead up to, the characters behind, and the culmination of, the 1981 World Series Of Poker. My main criticism of the book has little to do with the text itself. With poker becoming more mainstream, it was inevitable that the stakes would become higher, the stories would become crazier and this title and others like it would be left behind. As an example, the main prize in this book is several hundred thousand dollars. Compare this to the million dollar prize pools that are now being generated on an almost weekly basis and the reader can be forgiven for being dismissive about a first prize of "only" $375,000. The book recounts tales of businessmen being "stuck" for $50,000 but again compare that to the recent colossal struggle between Andy Beal and the Vegas professionals, where Beal initially gained the upper hand but eventually lost $10 million. Perhaps the one reason I would recommend the book is for its fleeting glance into the life of Stu Ungar, perhaps one of the greatest players to ever grace the felt. However, other than that I would say that there are many other poker titles I would recommend reading first, for example Nolan Dalla's "One of a Kind", a book that I suspect will stand the test of time 
 What a disappointment! Boosting Immunity is a collection of chapters by different authors that is poorly focused and lacks continuity. There is nothing new in this book. It is mostly a rehash of commonly available information and some of the chapters, like chapter two, read like they were copied out of an enclyclopedia. The most attractive thing about this book is the title. Save your money 
 while her poetry isn't the worst i've read, graham's isn't that great... her poems drag on, all could be cut by about half or even a third. she seems to forget just what the english language can do in the hands of a master, because her poems are flat and i've heard of people talking about her work being difficult. i think they confuse difficult with nothing to say 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 This movie on Chomsky isn't very unique or interesting.  He is a brilliant man, and his books will obviously teach you more.  A good dvd to check out is manufacturing consent - man. consent is almost three hours long, with a good structure that the movie follows, with more complete explanations of Chomsky's ideas.  Rebel w/o a pause is a hastily put together film, which dedicates too little time to each current issue, i.e. the war in Iraq.  Entertaining, but not a good source of information 
 I was incredibly disappointed by this superficial book masquerading as scholarship and hiding behind manipulated or massaged statistics. All of these yahoos who think this is a solid piece of research need to read more about the subject.  The book argues that foreign occupation is the problem. This is a necessary though insufficient condition. This does not explain suicide bombings without occupation and occupations without suicide bombing. Furthermore, the book tries to pursuade you with statistics that do not hold up the central hypothesis. Finally, how do you have  a book that completely ignores all the work on terrorism that existed before it... The book duplicates the work that Bruce Hoffman (of Rand Corporation) did in the Atlantic Monthly two years previously and yet he is not cited. This is intellectually dishonest to say the least.  The author has a terrific PR machine but for a seriously interested person, skip this one and read one of the better reviewed books on the subject 
 One of the most boring....dull....stupid Peter Sellers comedies.  If you can find more then  2 or 3 laughs good luck.  I love Peter Sellers in THE PINK PANTHER movies and he was brilliant in a great number of films.....but he falls far short in this one and Goldie Hawn is wasted totally 
 If the sight of a 400lb. man's bare hindquarters terrifies you... STAY AWAY! If the thought of a middle-aged Lief Garrett "rapping" fills your veins w/ icewater... STAY AWAY! If foot-tall 80s hairstyles make you cringe in fear... STAY AWAY! Yes, this is CHEERLEADER CAMP, a film full of cheerleading routines that may be too intense for some viewers! Watch as 30yo teenagers fight to survive against an unknown killer among them! See the horror as pom poms swish and shake! Stand astonished during the hideous school mascots' dance-off! Feel the life drain from your body as 88 minutes simply disappear! YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN, YOU ARE DOOMED...         
 I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work 
 I blame Yoko Ono for helping split up the Beatles (I think the Beatles were on stormy seas anyway, but Yoko was definitely the iceberg and John steered the ship right for it).  "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" IS about Lennon's love for LSD, despite the same type of lying he tried to deny in the "Beatles Bigger Than Jesus" backpedaling.  (Come on: McCartney just admitted that "Got To Get You into My Life" was about weed!). Yoko Ono has hijacked the Lennon legacy all these years for her own nefarious purposes.  She's just sold Lennon's likeness as an "action-figure doll," for Pete's sake.  And we're still dealing with the talentless half of the Lennon/Ono union.  First Yoko.  Now Sean.  The Instant Karma Lennon sang about all those years ago is still tormenting us--which is a meaning I'm sure John never saw coming.  The ultimate horror of what all the hippies wished upon their enemies--the Government, the Establishment--has come back on them.  SELL OUT is what they all did.  Lennon would be horrified.  I suppose there is some form of justice that the Ono bloodline is completely devoid of talent or shame.  They can put out as many CDs as they want, they can engineer tribute shows to John without inviting any of the Beatles or the son who could sing (Julian), and they can use that unholy alliance they have with Rolling Stone magazine to put their faces out there as much as they want (the last time I saw Sean, he was on the cover under the heading, CHILDREN OF ROCK STARS).  But the same kind of status-quo and denial and propaganda they cursed back in the day...is now their standard-operating procedure. It's almost funny 
 I found this book to be lacking in many respects- the story of a man wrongly accused and about to be executed has been done enough and there was nothing in this one that justified telling it again. The characters were all either unlikable, depressing or boring. The pace was slow and the writing sub par, and confusing when it didn't have to be. I also found the sex scenes bordering on gross- I'm not really averse to sex in novels (and Turow is more graphic than many writers), but I really didn't want to hear about one of the characters menstruating....it just did nothing for the story. I plodded through this one, but have concluded the only Turow book worth reading is Presumed Innocent. 
 Once again a conservative minister with traditional views thinks women needed a man to not only think FOR them...but to tell us what WE are actually thinking!!!!! If you want to know what wives wish their husbands knew, ask a real wife. If you want to enhance your traditional conservative marriage, this book is for you. Otherwise, not good for modern couple 
 This book surprised me very much.. when i read a book I expect to learn something or at least be entertained... I kept looking for the purpose and/or message of this book...I found it meaningless/pointless and not even based on truth.  I guess the authors were trying to be clever.... it did not strike me as clever.  I am sorry to say I found no value... not for kids, not for adults... not for anyone.  
 I read the book to find a new gems of wisdom from the prophet.  It became clear that the book is full of virtues that very few would quibble with.  However, you would think that a modern prophet would give at least one quote from the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, or Pearl of Great Price. But there is not a singe one.  Upon reading the book, everyone will see that we believe in the Bible, since it is quoted every few pages. The book stands for everything Christian that everyone will agree with, and stands for nothing that is uniquely Mormon.  No mention of the restoration of the gospel, Joseph Smith, eternal families, or any of our beliefs from the plan of salvation.  More and more, we seem to downplay who we are, a part of mainstreaming which all members should objectively admit is occurring.  
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 I agree with one of the other reviewers: The author's strong opinions really get in the way. In only 20 minutes of reading the parts available online, it's clear the author has made some grievous, dangerous statements for young people. First, the author states that sex is only for marriage and making babies, and that anything outside of that is prostitution. Um, no. I'm not saying we should tell teenagers to go screwing around all over the place, but this is simply wrong. To the author, even people living together but who love each other apparently can't have meaningful sex unless both reproduction and marriage are included. Second, the author cleanly disregards any mention of the existence of homosexuality. To the author, a sexual relationship must be one man, one woman, and marriage, period. And girls are only attracted to guys and vice versa. Third, the author claims for Christianity the "love thy neighbor" behavior, calling it "Christian Love" - you see, to distinguish it from Romantic Love. You know, because other religions or atheists don't care about their fellow human beings. Fourth, the author claims that Virtue triumphs over Evil. This is a fairly juvenile statement. Sorry, but it's only a general trend for the average human being. There are plenty of people out there doing evil things because they are good at doing it and not getting taken down. The statement that virtue always triumphs almost sounds like mind control for teenagers 
 Boh-ring.  One mildly redeeming feature is it's "table of openings"in the back, but other than this, Lasker's writing style andteaching method will put even a Grandmaster to sleep 
 Last year I purchased Dave's...A Smooth Jazz Christmas...and was thrilled with it.  So thrilled in fact that I thought I'd go ahead and buy this one.  I looked at the ratings here at Amazon.com and thought I had nothing to lose.  Now don't get me wrong...this is not a bad CD...though it isn't all that great either.  My major complaint is that 9 of the 13 songs on it are also on 'A Smooth Jazz Christmas'.  In my opinion...that is ridiculous!  What was Dave thinking?  Anyway...if you are thinking of buying one of Dave's Christmas CDs....forget this one...and buy 'A smooth Jazz Christmas' instead.  It surpasses this one in all categories 
 I saw this movie in the theater, when it first came out, and thought it was a good movie! I bought it, advertised as an all-new, fully loaded and FULLY EXPOSED EDITION!  What I saw, was the same movie, and if they showed anymore, then in the original movie, I never saw anything different!  Checking to see that this is 2007, and on top of it, a European movie, one would expect to see, as the viewers in the movie itself saw, THE FULL MONTY!    But did I expect too much, to see, a fully nude male, from the front, which, at least in this country, the U.S. is like showing the Holy Grail.  Women, of course, are fair game, showing them fully nude, dancing together or kissing each other!  Have men do any of this, and American audiences gasp, and giggle nervously. Show a few limbs and heads getting cut off, with blood spurting, and people clap for more!    Do we wonder why record breaking violence keeps increasing?  If you enjoy 2 discs that contain dated boring details, and don't own the original DVD release, you might have waited for nothing!  The opportunity to update it, and show what we've all seen before, especially in this innocent and inspiring story line was missed! Yes, I truly felt ripped-off!     
 This was the only movie in the trilogy that I thought was clean enough to get a G rating.  They did not follow the story line from the last two films.  We meet a new Villian Belandona Ambells evil sister who has manipulated Carfaxce and his minnion Killer to help here ruin Christmas.  How careface got on Earth when he supposed to be dead and be in Hell is never covered. They have a cheesy flash back when you find out why he became such a bad dog.  Charlie is supposed to alive giving and second chance at the end of second film When he returned Gabriels horn. Belandona is decent but not as evil as the other villians I have seen if on my top hundred villans list Belandona is 11th in the top 20.  The 1st Sauron.  The 2th Naraku. 3th Malificent. 4th Cluney. The 5th Slagar the cruel.  The 6th Tasarmina. 7th. Badrang.  8th Golloum 9th Team Rocket. Tenth  Kagura.  I hardly recommend you don't she this movie it sucks even though it has a happy ended. And Carface goes good 
 I had high hopes. But this book does not deliver. First, it's a kind-of guide for parents traveling with VERY young children. Second, it offers only the most basic common-sense advice: "Don't drink the tap water in India" kind of thing. There is a book to be written on this subject but this is not it 
 Keegan started out years ago with a bang with The Face of Battle, in which the post-Vietnam and, for the UK, a post-Empire spirit made for a genuinely innovative military history.  This early promise has NOT been fulfilled, and Keegan has declined considerably in quality because he's become co-opted by the Establishment, a post-Empire, Blair establishment every bit as corrupt as Haig.  Keegan has never served in combat yet loftily recommended in the 1980s that the "tempo" of the next war (which as a Sandhurst insider he was probably planning) be increased to 24/7. In this, he gave NO consideration to the high levels of post-traumatic stress and the war crimes that have resulted from the US policy of "no sleep until Baghdad" in the second Iraq war.  Keegan is post-Sixties, all right, but instead of peace and love, he's a Nietzchean who'd wage war with the poor man's body.  His "war" is chateau generalship by the rich, actually fought, 24/7, by British working class lads, blackfellows from Britain's few remaining colonies, and of course Americans.  Keegan popularized and made respectable for a new generation the old lie, subtly and over time, dulce et decorum. Precisely by foregrounding war's utter brutality he made it somehow acceptable and ONCE AGAIN a test of manhood, and this has gotten people killed.  His book on Military Intelligence managed, idiotically, to dismiss MI as secondary and not critical precisely, almost to the day, when the American and British MI was declaring victory (remember Mission Accomplished?) and failing to see how disbanding the Iraqi army would create the insurgency.  The Iraq War recounts the war as a board game with neither any anticipation of the postwar mess nor any compassion whatsoever for the men and women who fought it, or the Iraqis brutalized. At key points, it expresses a puzzlement about the failure of Iraqis to greet their "liberators" which shows a willful incomprehension of anything outside military science.  Ignore all writings by John Keegan until he issues a public apology for the lives this twit has destroyed while sipping pink gin at Sandhurst. For a good history of the Iraq War cf. Thomas E. Ricks, THE IRAQ WAR 
 This movie lacked truly experienced actors in serious, and romantic roles.  Sure Chris and Sandra have starred in romantic movies, but they are unoriginal, and just like the next.  Chris O'Donnell was the last person who should have been picked for the role of such a noteworthy and distinguished American author.  This movie puts Ernest Hemmingway to shame.  Which is a complete disaster.  Where was the build-up of true love?  This movie bounced from one scene to the next, without ever convincing me Agnes and Ernest were truly in love.  This movie did not deserve the accolades it received from the critics.  It has the potential to be excellent, if there were different actors in the roles of Agnes and Ernest.  It had the potential to be good if it hadn't been so "Hollywood-ized."  If you're interested in Ernest Hemmingway's life, read "A Farewell to Arms."  It's far better 
 I was so eager to read this book. But I was so disappointed when I finally did read it. I couuldnt even make it to the end of it. its so boring. and she keeps jumping from a story to another without knowing what is the real point of telling that story. its like you'are sitting with some talkative chatterbox who keeps on talking and talking till you lose it..  
 You can bet that if Peter David had lifted a cliche as hoary as the "I am Spartacus" moment for one of his stories, he would have at least given a nod to his source! Spock as messiah became fairly tedious, as did the rehash of 'old codger from OST becoming a liability and then proving himself' plot line from RELICS. Dry, humorless, with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick. I just don't get why Mr. Friedman is so popular. I've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the ST fiction offerings in the last few years - Kevin Ryan, Peter David, Greg Cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit, heart and intelligence. Like another reviewer here, I keep trying to like this author's books since he is so prolific, but damn it, Jim, Star Trek fiction should never be a chore 
 This is an interesting book, no doubt about it. But the authors make mistakes common to Southern apologists.   The first is that the Civil War was not fought over slavery. Certainly the Civil War was not fought over the morality of slavery, with the North fighting for right and the South fighting to defend evil. But yes, the Civil War absolutely was fought over the Economics of Slavery. All wars are economic.  Here is a part of Georgia's Declaration of Secession:       For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slaveholding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery. They have endeavored to weaken our security, to disturb our domestic peace and tranquility, and persistently refused to comply with their express constitutional obligations to us in reference to that property, and by the use of their power in the Federal Government have striven to deprive us of an equal enjoyment of the common Territories of the Republic. This hostile policy of our confederates has been pursued with every circumstance of aggravation which could arouse the passions and excite the hatred of our people, and has placed the two sections of the Union for many years past in the condition of virtual civil war.  This is from South Carolina's declaration of secession:  The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia. Thus the constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation.  This from Texas':  Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated Union to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquility and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. She was received into the confederacy with her own constitution, under the guarantee of the federal constitution and the compact of annexation, that she should enjoy these blessings. She was received as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and protecting the institution known as negro slavery-- the servitude of the African to the white race within her limits-- a relation that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the white race, and which her people intended should exist in all future time. Her institutions and geographical position established the strongest ties between her and other slave-holding States of the confederacy. Those ties have been strengthened by association. But what has been the course of the government of the United States, and of the people and authorities of the non-slave-holding States, since our connection with them? The controlling majority of the Federal Government, under various pretences and disguises, has so administered the same as to exclude the citizens of the Southern States, unless under odious and unconstitutional restrictions, from all the immense territory owned in common by all the States on the Pacific Ocean, for the avowed purpose of acquiring sufficient power in the common government to use it as a means of destroying the institutions of Texas and her sister slaveholding States.        As for whether the majority of soldiers fighting were fighting for or against slavery, the question is frankly, ridiculous. Ask any veteran of Vietnam or Korea what they fought for. They fought because their country told them to fight. Not because they'd done a personal analysis of the communist threat. But for the COUNTRY, yes communism certainly was at the heart of those wars. 
 after changing this antenna out several times with the motorola stock  antenna on my wifi card,the results are, this antenna was a complete waste of money and is not as good as the stock antenna that came with the card 
 Had Nancy Varian Berberick played D&D before or read up on Dragonlance before writing this?  One of the most painful moments in this book is reading about Dalamar taking out a Blue Dragon by himself, by casting lightning bolts!  There is also the parts about not one but many dwarven mages running around the realms.  The portion about Dalamar taking the Test at the Tower of High Sorcery was not too bad though.  The book started off well enough.  After a prologue which basically recapitulated what readers of Legends already know, the first chapter set Dalamar as a lowly servant in a caste-rigid society of Silvanesti.  The elven kingdom was under threat by the dragonarmy - and Dalamar suggested strategy to hit the rear of the enemy when it was clear the elves were overpowered.  The strategy was carried out but the sheer might of the dragon against the elves meant it could not turn the tide after all.  The book followed with Dalamar fleeing along with the rest of refugees from Silvanesti to Ergoth where the haughty elves enslaved the wild elves inhabitants of Ergoth.  Through the process, until the elves returned to Silvanesti, the author made repeated shows of Dalamar losing faith and totally put off with the Silvanesti's obsession with the worship of Eli, or Paladine.  However, the true clerics had long ago been removed from Krynn prior to the Cataclysm and elven societies were supposed to have given up on the gods as well.  They may preserve the memories, but no cleric received any spells until (1) the Dark Queen granted her followers spells, and (2) Goldmoon became a cleric of Mishakal through the staff and the Platinum Discs were recovered.  Clearly the author missed out an integral aspect of the settings of Dragonlance.  An author may reserve her own creative license, but when writing within an established fictional setting, should either comply or set up her own 
 I was highly disappointed with this audiobook. I had been expecting it to open up a personal insight into the author's experiences that others could perhaps relate to and help them cope with tragic personal loss. Instead it was chock full of copious detail about irrelevant and meandering topics that showcase Ms. Didions outstanding literary research capabilities, travel and life experiences, but deny the listener an insight into her real feelings and experiences.   I kept listening hoping to warm to the author (I was trying very, very hard to do so let me tell you) and empathize with her experiences but she kept the reader very firmly at arms distance in their place from start to finish. This audiobook is full of so many facts and figures (all in a  minutia of detail) that is reminiscent of a writer who is a talented Googleer and research technician, but who can't relate to real people in a down to earth manner.    The end product is a meticulously detailed and clinical exposition that has the warmth of a bag of ice.  
 When the character who is narrating a lengthy novel is as unbelievable and artificial as Hannah Musgrave is in "The Darling", the book is not worthy of completing.    
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.  
 Being a huge fan of Golden Age mystery fiction and also an admirer of Gypsy Rose Lee, I was very eager to read this book.  I also have the film "Lady of Burlesque" with Barbara Stanwyck, which follows the book fairly closely and which I thorougly enjoy.  However, although Gypsy Rose Lee "stars" in the story which involves murders among the striptease acts in an Opera House, the writing is rather uninvolving and I who read voraciously had trouble staying interested.  I also confess to being rather annoyed at the petty squabbling between the women which fails to capture the friendships that also develop between women.  In fact, the characterizations remain on an extremely superficial level and the few colorful instances (almost "pre-code" sort of moments) do not rescue the story or make it any more compelling.  I found myself bored and wanting to read something else.  It's a pity, because I truly did want to like it and the premise was promising.  My conclusion:  Gypsy Rose Lee was a very beautiful woman and I imagine a powerful and provocative performer with some class to boot, but she is not a great writer by any stretch of the imagination.  Being a great performer or leading a colorful life does not necessarily mean that you can write; writing is a whole other art form and too many people think it requires no particular skill since one is not required to do eye-high kicks or hit high notes.  They're absolutely wrong, as misfires such as this demonstrate (although I've read far worse).    A disappointment, but may fill the bill for someone looking for a light read.  To use an apt cliche:  mediocre fare.  
               A highly detailed coverage of the Third Reich as it rose to and consolidated its power in Germany during the 1930 decade. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone interested in analysing events leading up to World War II.                The Devil however is in the details. The author makes sweeping statements about the Versaille treaty that are neither logical or reasonable. He fails to place the beginnings of the practice of racial hygiene in Germany within the larger context of the worldwide movement in that area. When he mentions the Spanish civil war he quotes from some sources that are known to be inaccurate.                These are just a few areas where the author has been less than thorough. Despite the foregoing I would gladly urge people interested in the history of the Twentieth century to read this book; always bearing in mind that this obviously vast subject is covered incompletely here. 
 We had high aspirations and scrupulously read this book looking for guidance, all to no avail. This book contains incorrect and misleading information. We tried the various links for additional data many of which were no longer on the web. Others that we contacted via e-mail the response was not what was designated in the book. Peter and Tara provide their e-mail addresses, but they neither respond nor answer questions. The only conclusion that one can draw is that they crank out the books just to sell them and make a quick dollar. They don't really intend to be there for the consumer.    We have since spoken with others who purchased the book and they were also disgusted and very disappointed. This book was a total waste of money. The only thing that it is good for is the garbage or fireplace 
 100 Bullets had me very interested in the Vertigo comic series, that coupled with the fact the cover had quite nice art. Once I got in I found the concept to be pretty sound: Fairy tales characters all lived in a giant kingdom that was conquered so now they live in modern day new york. All the characters were there too... but despite all this Willingham decides to mess with original stories a bit to make things more interesting I suppose. That set me off from the begining.  I read on, hoping the end would justify the means. However, by the end of the book I felt all the characters were rather shallow, casting aside the myth behind them was fine, but not much work was done to build up the new characters beyond paper-cutter archetypes. I will try the second volume, but my hopes for this series have been violently dashed against the rocks 
 The remix sucks.  DOn't even buy the whole remixes on iTunes, they really are bad.  I will write reviews for their other remixes.  Nerd once again strikes out with another _________ comment.  The title is the NATO Phoetic alphabet, your stupid piece of _____.  Once again, you have no idea what you are talking about.  Becuase your stupid.  Tell me, could you write a song like this?    Your respone will be:  No, but It's stupid anyway! or, YES!  No, no you couldn't.  _____ off, your reasons on your pathetic reivew for Hooray shows how much of a dumbarse you are.  THe people who understand the jokes will know how stupid the BHG haters are 
 Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author 
 My second disc, side one, skips, pauses, rolls back -- tell me how can I right this 
 Ug. I really dislike this movie. Dune is one of my favorite books, and this movie totally ruined it. It is boring, confusing, unfaithful to the book, and just plain badly done. If you want to see the real Dune, watch the amazing miniseries done by sci-fi channel and it's sequel, Children of Dune. Both are much better done and much more faithful to the source material 
 DO NOT rely on this book to pass the exam. It lightly touches most of the important subjects, but goes nowhere near deep enough to be useful. I agree is it better written that the BCSI book, but it needs to be much more thourough in its handling of the subject matter. Very poor considering its Cisco 
 I picked up this book in the airport on the way to the Caribbean, thinking it would be a perfect diversion for the 9 hours of flights that lay ahead.  What I got instead was a random collection of sordid descriptions designed to evoke the basest of emotions.  A sex scene alternating with a torture scene, on and on, over and over, both without much variation, for a seemingly endless number of pages.  I consider myself a sensualist when it comes to storytelling, and indeed some of my favorite books are early Anne Rice, such as "All Saints" and the first vampire books, but these books, unlike "The Witch" are lush, ripe and actually tell stories.  I never found an actual storyline in "The Witch", just a grouping of redundant descriptions, and even more damnable, poorly written cliches!  Every couple of pages someone is spread and tasted, then entered at the last moment as the two lose their oneness in screaming ecstacy.  Then, someone is beaten, or tortured, or dies an agonising death from the plague.  Exacerbating the problem of redundancy is a fatal lack of character developement. I never felt acquainted enough with any character to care if she was about to loosen someone's throbbing member, or be stretched on the rack til his eyeballs popped out (oops!  I gave away a climactic scene!)  My recommendation for this book is- fuggetaboutit!  If you like this sort of repetitive sexual desciption, Penthouse forum does it better.  If it's violence you're after, just turn on your television 
 I am just sitting here reading this book, studying for a huge exam tomorrow morning, and I am just getting so incredibly frustrated with this book and decided that I should let it out on here. Oh my God, there is a mistake on like every friggin page... and to make matters worse, all the mistakes are right smack-dab in the middle of an example problem. So there you are, trying to learn how to work certain problems, and all of a sudden, there's something that just doesnt seem to make any sense. And the whole time you're thinking that you're stupid and you just cant figure out the correct way to do the problem, until a wasted-hour later, you finally realize... "oh, its just ANOTHER stupid mistake these idiots made, and i thought i was retarded." Grrrr, this is killin me.  I cannot freakin believe that they could actually charge $140.00 for a book no one even bothered to proofread. okay, so point of the story is... this book sucks, dont buy it if you can get around it, i'd recommend. 
 I originally wrote a relatively favorable review for this book because it seemed to incorporate the best of the original Butler's Lives (a focus on meditating on the life of the saint) and the new calendar of saints (including many recent canonizations).  While it does do the second, I am afraid to say that it is woefully inadequate regarding the first.  In fact, it is probably just as bad as the Atwater/Thurston edition.  For instance, here is part of the section from January 27th on St. Angela Merici: "Accounts of her [St. Angela Merici's] childhood make her pious, rebelling against the fashions of the age, devoted to the legend of St. Ursula, and the recipient of a vision showing a great company of virgins and other saints coming down from heaven to her.  They included a dead sister, who invited her to form a great 'Company of Virgins,' which was what Angela had actually done by the time the account was written."  In other words, the author wants to point out that the story "must" not be true because it wasn't written down until after the alleged vision had been fulfilled.  Now, we are certainly not bound to believe all the accounts in the various lives of the saints, but I do not understand the point of drawing attention to the alleged falsity of a tale in the context of a meditative reading.  If the work seeks to be encyclopedic, it is much too short and you should check on the 12-vol. counterpart, but for a daily meditation (which it seems reasonable to assume such a work is designed to be), such statements are misplaced.  If the story is too absurd to be believed, just don't include it.  As a result, it is disappointing because it would be useful to have a modern Butler's that can be used for a daily devotional or meditation.  Instead, we are left with the old works that do not match the current calendar 
 Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.  Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:  1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.  2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.  3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.   4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, "HCE."  This was Joyce's way of "getting at" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.  5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.   6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.  If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: "How many puns and themes can *I* find?"  This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.  
 In this book a large group of Harvard economists and political scientists, and a few anthropologists, debate the radical proposition that culture makes a difference in economic development. While its nice to know the foreign policy elite are ready to think about culture as more than `western civilization,' it turns out that this allows them to blame all poverty on the malformed and defective cultures of underdeveloped countries. It's as if the `culture of poverty' debate never took place. Most anthropologists will grind away several millimeters of tooth enamel while reading this. Why do economists and political scientists feel like they don't have to read the work of people who have devoted their lives to studying cultural difference? 
 Purchase this only if you have a minute idea of what a computer is.  This is very elementary and assumes you have absolutely no knowledge of what a network even is. It doesn't go any further than that either.  Don't expect that you will be learn how to network computers together (my expectation); only that you will learn what components are involved --but not how they work or how to actually network them. I don't mind basic info, but this book should be titled "Network Equipment Descriptions for Dummies" certainly not it's current title. Way too many jokes as well (more annoying than entertaining) 
 I really wanted to like this book, because I've loved all her other books. However, the usual magic just wasn't there.  I felt Regina had serious issues that should have at least been talked out with Blue concerning his "mission" and instead there are just alot of doubts that she has that they never really address. They have a five minute conversation, but not the kind of talk a woman has with a man who is the father of her child who is doing things that could land him in jail (b/c lets face it, as poetic as it is, it's also illeagal and if some of the thugs he takes out wanted some revenge, it wouldn't be impossible to get...which is the kind of thing a woman should consider when she's contemplating raising a child in that environment) Secondly, with the exceptions of Blue, Abby, Peaches, and Regina, there just aren't any real sympathetic characters. You have the trifling brother army deserter, the General who is clearly losing his grip on reality a little more each day, the dirty cop, crooked politicians, the loving husband who's secretly [...] and frequents many DL nights at clubs, and the stripper with the heart of gold....wait, wrong novel, i mean the stripper/[...]who's mostly motivated by money and a desire to go to vegas. It's just pages and pages of losers justifying their selfish, irrational, and/or dangerous behavior. And the whole relationship between General, Blue's Mom, and the stripper? Just sick. I go to Miss Cleage's books, because as a 19 year old black female, its good to see books where black people have hope and act like real people instead of wannabe thugs and/or people who are acting like they just got out of Africa the other day and slavery just ended two hours ago. I mean, respect the past but it's time to move on to gather our strength as a psople and rise. And usually her books give me that, but this time there was nobody for me to really cheer for. Although Blue's vision, and the way he made people get respect by forcing them to act in a way that garners respect was pretty awesome 
 Terrible. I actually liked this band when I was extremely young. I'm glad I woke up and seen them and country music for what it really is.  These guys have too many cheesy type of ballads. Their dull and depressing 
 I was prepared to like this book, especially after the rave reviews found here on Amazon, and Audible. But I found that Haunted Ground: A novel, quickly lost my interest. Why, you may ask? Because the author has too many characters and she head-hops between them constantly. Each section is narrated by a new character, and frankly I lost interest. I prefer books with one, possibly two voices but not a half dozen. This is particularly disconcerting in audio format. Plus, I found the drippy American character with the tortured past and murdered sister a bit trite and maudlin.   Feh, overall, 2 stars. If she had stuck to a single or maybe dual perspective it might've captured my interest 
  As a fan of the original series, I never once planned to see this film. Not for the poor casting (the only one who resembled anyone from the original was the General Lee), the rehashed plot, or the fact that Hollywood has taken a once good and decent show and added alot of sex and profanity to it, but for the simple fact that Jessica Simpson should never be allowed in front of a movie camera. Joe Simpson, if you're reading this review, please stop bombarding your idiot daughter upon our society!! 
 Why was this ever made? Just to make fans of the original mad? Rod Serling is rolling over in his grave. When I originally saw this in Burbank, CA, we were screaming and groaning at the screen 
 I have waited for years to buy Calphalon cookware because I was under the false impression of its quality. I had an old set of S. S. Waterless Cookware made by Ecko; the Ecko set outperformed Calphalon in every measurement. My thought for buying the new set was Ecko cheap, Calphalon quality. Every thing sticks in this set, pork chops even stuck to the so called non-stick surface pan; and no the chops were not right from the fridge, that would cause them to stick. Some of the pans without non-stick coating had dimples in the metal. The box states they are dishwasher safe; however the instructions state differently. On an electric stove one of the pans developed burn marks on the bottom of the pan over medium high heat. The list goes on, and if you contact customer service you get canned answers to send the cookware to them at your cost; they did not read mine. Oh they did tell me I could keep the lids, no wonder they do not fit; you can move them about 1/8" back and forth. DO NOT BUY! 
 This is the book that launched the myth that pharmacology could do to the psyche what cosmetic surgery does for the human body. After all the hype and hoopla in the media the reality that SSRI's in general are breakthrough medications for depression have fallen to the sidelines. Prior to 1993 Prozac was handed out only to patients who had severe cases of ocd and depression. Although the SSRI's have a better side effect profile they are not more effective then older meds. Kramer claims to have witnessed miraculous changes in a handful of patients where no other doctor has.  I WONDER WHY KRAMER NEVER WROTE A FOLLOW UP REGARDING THESE PATIENTS WHO HAD UNDERGONE SUCH MAGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS. MAYBE BECAUSE THE EFFECT (IF THERE WERE ANY AT ALL) WERE SHORT LIVED ANY POOPED OUT AFTER A SHORT TIME. HAD THEY BEEN REAL AND LASTING I AM SURE THAT KRAMER WOULD HAVE CASHED IN WITH ANOTHER BESTSELLER. FOOLED AGAIN!   
    There is not enough space for me to explain why this film(and soundtrack) are woefully inadequate of the name Dr. Seuss.      The Fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism(what the book was complaining about, wake up people!) and James Horner's score which has a couple of nice moments but doesn't have that Seussian sound. 'Where are you Christmas' is annoying beyond all reason and I mean both versions. And whose bright idea was it to have Jim Carrey mangle 'You're a Mean One'?      If you're looking for a more Grinch like score, go find Elfman's Nightmare Before Christmas 
 Douglas Adams' reading of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is truly engaging. The problem with this audio book is two-fold:  1. None of the tracks has any text-encoding. This means that devices that read this information cannot use or display the CD names or track names. So, an iTunes won't read any CD names or track names, nor will any CD player that can show CD names or track names.  2. CD #6 of the set repeats the same scene over and over, without ever reaching the ending.   New Millenium Audio destroyed a perfectly enjoyable performance with its poor mastering of the CD 
 Even though the book is not very expensive through Amazon, it really doesn't have much to offer.  It's main purpose, in my opinion, is to introduce the reader to the products that Mercola sells through his website.  He may claim that he's only offering important health products to his readers, but he's making a lot of money selling these things (just check out the outrageous "shipping and handling" charges added to each order).  His newsletter is basically marketing for these products.  I hate to admit it, but I fell for one of his pitches regarding a chocolate bar that is actually good for you.  I paid over $40 for a dozen 2 ounce bars only to be told a couple of weeks later that they were contaminated with lead (some health food!).  It's now been over two weeks and I'm still trying to get the information from them on how to send this item back at their expense. Do yourself a favor and buy "Protein Power" or "Neanderthin" instead.  They are better books and they won't hit you with constant marketing to get you to buy their "healthy" products 
 I have to disagree with many of the reviews here, far from being their best album, this so far is my least favorite of TMBG's work.  While some may enjoy the music styles, they seem to not be paying much attention to the lyrics.  TMBG is notorious for their use of symbolism and metaphor to convey a deeper meaning, whether historical, political or social commentary, or whatever it may be.  If you only listen to a TMBG album for the music, you're missing the brilliance of their artistry.  That having been said, this album seems to reveal something of the darker side of the group.  The songs cover topics such as alcoholism and drug abuse, government control, combat, death and destruction, adultery, and blasphemy to name a few.  Personally, I didn't care for the choice of material.  I'm sure others will disagree with me, some will enjoy the subject matter.  There's no doubt that the album is well crafted, with TMBG's usual crazy approach to serious topics, and there are even some songs I enjoy, but the darker overtone of this album just wasn't my style.  This one's going back on the shelf, and I'll stick to the rest of the albums in my hefty stack of TMBG music 
 this book just didn't do it for me. I still don't see the point and the ending left me feeling like "so what". Lee Smith is a talented writer so I won't give up reading other books by her, but this one won't be on my list of saves 
 O please!  She slept with Elvis?  That should have been the first sign that the "delicious excess" in this book is an excess of ego and self-promotion.  Does this woman have no shame?  Then, of course, she goes on to sleep with Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, and countless other men, ruining her marriage to the man she professed that she could never live without.  Unbelievable.  This gives new meaning to "she slept her way to the top."  All of her positive accomplishments are negated by her horrible behavior and huge ego.    
 I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed.  I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't."  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother.      
 I loved this grinder when we first got it because we use a french press, an automatic coffee pot, and an espresso maker. The array of grinds is wonderful! If it only lasted.... I had the same problem as everyone else, the ring broke & I found myself shoving paper in just to get a seal. Would be a superior product if they made it to last 
 Bob Saget is the star......What does that tell you 
 In "Iron John," Robert Bly announces that American men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness.  He illustrates his point with one of the Brothers Grimm's more obscure (and frankly less interesting) stories, interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point.  He also draws heavily on Freudian and Jungian theories.  He proves his point in the same way Freud and Jung proved theirs' i.e. by saying "This is what I see, I am the expert, so that makes it true, Occham's Razor be darned."  Bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions, nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or, heaven forbid, that his observations might be wrong.  For example, Bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 (conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion, despite his objective tone).  Bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true.  He does not consider that by age 35, most men have realized that they don't really want to be firemen.  Could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to (such as self-help books)?  Naw, it's gotta be that "dreams" thing.  Bly also describes a case where students during the Viet Nam war broke into their college presidents' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the CIA.  Bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures, because their fathers left home to work, preventing their sons from seeing how men work.  Bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger.  No, there had to be a "real" reason for the break-in, and aren't we lucky to have Robert Bly to tell us what it is?  Along the way, Bly overloads his writing with literary references, all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes.  It's all very pretentious, er uh, interesting, but so what?  I could interpret the same passages to mean something else.  If I lived at the time the passages were written, my interpretation would most likely be very different, despite Bly's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal.  Bly' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down, however.  It underscores what is wrong with his whole premise.  He tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact, but uses only subjective views (many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context) to support the idea.  Sorry Bob, you can't have it both ways.  One gets the impression that "Iron John" was cynically written to fill a niche.  Like all self-help books, "Iron John" targets a specific audience, tells them they are not happy, and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy.  Bly's target audience is White men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements.  If you do not need a political movement to define who you are, then "Iron John" is not for you 
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 This product wasn't delivered to me for at least 2 1/2 weeks. After one review, the customer service rep from Allergy Be Gone emailed me bribing me to take my review off. He mentioned that Amazon would be reviewing his company, and he didn't want Amazon to see the negative comment. He promised me free filters and offered me a $20 gift certificate if I removed the comment. His name is Jason P, and he goes by judahp for his email account. What a jerk. I will never buy from Allergy Be Gone again 
 I am a witch interested in the roots of my religion which lie in the Qabalah. I have studied the Qabalah before, using the more traditional approaches of e.g. Dion Fortune, and I was expecting this book to be a kind of missing link between the highly esoteric approach and the more down-to-earth pagan viewpoints. I also bought the book to learn how to apply Qabalistic concepts into my own spirituality.  Both my expectations were never fulfilled. "The Witches Qabalah" is a very easy read, but that is exactly why it can never be a good treatise on anything as profound as the Qabalah. And it isn't; the Tree of Life is presented in a matter-of-fact way with a great many number of correspondences, some of them of interest to paganists but certainly not all of them. The various diagrams are useful, but all-in-all it left me a little dissatisfied. Still: it is a good introduction to the systematic approach of the Qabalah to spirituality, but for those already acquainted with it it will leave a sense of superficiality.   But what I found worse than that is that the title does not keep its promise. The Qabalah is discussed (or, rather, presented) in the traditional judaeo-occult framework. Witchcraft and wicca concepts sporadically enter the discussion, but this happens far to infrequently to justify the title "Witches' Qabalah".   To me the book appears to be simplifying the Qabalah - sometimes  to the point of dogmatism- and embellishing it with some remarks and elements that will cater and appeal to the pagan community.   The author also seems quite preoccupied with the traditional Angels, Archangels, Names of Power and other typically Qabalistic ideas. This is all OK for ceremonial magic users, but of less immediate interest to the average witch or pagan who hopes to gain a deeper understanding of his or her own path, rather than learning about the assets of a different path.   My final assessment of this book: a nice and quick read and a nice and readable introduction to elements of the Qabalah. The treatment of the relationship between Qabalah and Witchcraft or other pagan paths I found highly unsatisfactory, however. 
 Hank obviously is unhappy with the emotionalism that comes with revival, healing, and signs and wonders. In reality many of the healing miracles done through the healing movement have scientific and medical proof.   That doesnt mean that the healers are not sinners just like you and me. It does not mean that the revivalists are not normal people. It just means that God works through real people to make miracles happen. Which sounds alot like the book of Acts. Hank probably wouldnt have been too comfy if he had been at Pentecost. 
 This book did not live up to expectations.  The discussions of the rounds did not tell the reader enough useful information.  There were a lot of fun to know facts - amaze your friends and all of that - but not enough information on how to use the round, good ranges to sight in the various rounds versus potential uses, reloading insights (best loads, best rifle twists for what bullet weight) and more of that kind of technical information.  That is why I only gave the book two stars 
 Although the "Everything Dog Book" has some helpful advice about selecting a dog & introducing it to your home, the training methods that it advocates are outdated, unnecessary, inefficient and inhumane.  The reliance on choke chains and forcing behavior are likely to lead to behavioral issues and can have a very negative affect on the relationship between dog and person.  There are far better ways to train a dog to obey that make learning enjoyable and easy for both dog and human.  Better options are: "Dog Training for Dummies", "The Dog Whisperer", and "For the Life of Your Dog: A Complete Guide to Having a Dog From Adoption and Birth Through Sickness and Health". The last two choices in particular are great choices as they offer a wealth of practical information that will apply through the life of your dog. For your dog's sake and your own, try a book that relies on training through positive reinforcement 
 I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated 
 Yeesh. The title of this book, Suburban Sweatshops:  The Fight for Immigrant Rights would lead you to believe that it's an expansive look at a *nationwide* problem - would it not?. Well, it's actually a very cerebral discussion of the author's own (commendable) work setting up the Workplace Project, a small resource center for immigrant workers in Long Island. Still sounds interesting, doesn't it? Well, it might have been, in other hands, but we actually learn remarkably little about the workers.  We meet a few individuals - or rather, "case histories" - but the author is a lawyer, not a writer, so while we're told a lot about the workers' grievances, we learn very little about their actual lives (and nothing whatever about the other side of the story, if any). Mostly, it's a lot of chin-rubbing about legal and organizational strategies for increasing the influence of Long Island wage-earners. Perhaps the publisher thought that giving the book this broad title (it ought to have been called something like, "MY Fight for Immigrant Rights") would increase sales. It worked on me - 20 bucks later I have a book I don't want and my only way of defending myself is . . . this indignant review. The reason it gets two stars instead of one is because Gordon has done so much good work for our country and, in particular, the most exploited and neglected among us. I would much rather have contributed the 20 bucks directly to her organization. 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 Upon reading the Preface and Introduction I can't believe my eyes.  I have seen english comp 101 papers with more clarity than Berlinski.    I am interested in all types of science and lately Genetic Algorithms have peaked my interest; but after my brief journey with Berlinski's prose I'm feeling carsick from the yo-yo inebriated turn of phrase.    I suppose this book is redeeming in the fact that it attemts to explain the vast complexity and neccessity of the algorithm, but for one who enjoys syntax and sentence elegance this book leaves a bitter taste for the next scientific read.  If you don't know about algorithms already, I suggest you look desperately for another book before you become frustrated at Berlinski's.  If already know about algorithms, this may be a brilliant read for you.  
 I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
 My mother recently ordered this book by Mr. Chopra and was urging me to read it. She spoke very highly of it and told me that he used science to prove God and such, etc. Allow me to be upfront. I am a skeptic, and a firm Atheist. I do not believe in the backward illogical concept of God that most religion would scare you to believe in. But I decided to keep an open mind, as I always do, and I read Mr. Chopra's "How To Know God" from cover to cover.   First of all, Mr. Chopra does not speak of the God that most religions speak of. He in fact urges the reader to rethink their concept of God, the first chapter is called "A Real and Useful God". Here Mr. Chopra describes a God that all of us can reach directly, and he also describes most people's general view of God and how he is a supposedly unattainable God until death...etc. He then devises 7 Stages of God, that match our human emotions and says there is a God for each stage. He continues to say that whenever we feel this or that, we are experiencing the God of that stage. This is where I begin to have a problem.   Mr. Chopra begins this book with his own concept of God, that is neither supported by scientific evidence or any sort of rational thought at all. I was unable to get anything out of the following pages because I could not help wondering why I was not given any evidence into Mr. Chopra's thought process. He simply creates his own idea and flies with it, assuming the reader will just go along with it and not apply any sort of thought. This is weak and misleading. But I continued to read. He then begins to talk about three versions of reality, the material reality (the material world), virtual reality, and quantum reality (God's world outside of space-time). He then says that there are many arguments in the material world against God, but none of these can be applied because God is not in the material reality, he is in the Quantum reality. Absolute garbage! Pure assumption! I was outraged by this statement, and saw it as a poor way of denying the logical and rational arguments against God. Mr. Chopra once again maintains excellent continuity by not supporting his claims with any sort of scientific evidence. How can he say that God is in a different reality? What makes him think God isn't in the same reality that we are in? How does he know there is a virtual reality? These so-called "realities" seem very fabricated to me. They are a clever way of escaping arguments against God, if you put God outside of this world then you can't apply any arguments from our reality to his, according to Chopra. I do not buy this, and feel sorry for anyone who does. I am impressed though. That is a clever trick, and nothing more than a trick. Mr. Chopra seems to be exhibiting "wishful thinking" here. He acknowledges that the mind is in search of God and needs God (with scientifc evidence), I believe Chopra's mind is just like all other minds and wants to justify God and find God, so he will by all means attempt to do that. He wishes for there to be a God, and so there will be. He can change his reality as he pleases. This sort of wishful thinking is dangerous when explaning or proving a point because it makes Mr. Chopra incredibly biased and unreliable.   While reading this book in its early pages I was almost assured that Mr. Chopra was speaking of God in a purely metaphorical sense, but I later found (much to my disappointment) that he was speaking of God in a very real and literal sense. Many will claim that Chopra uses "science" and "quantum physics" to explain God and how we can reach him, but that is a misconception and perversion of the truth. Mr. Chopra does indeed make clever points using theories and stories involving quantum physics, but they do not relate directly to the existence of God, or our ability to reach him. They seem to just be random tidbits Chopra throws in so he can say he proved God and our ability to reach him with "science." It is an absolute mockery.   I did find Mr. Chopra's ending chapters on the paranormal (telepathy, esp, clairvoyance, synchronicity) to be interesting, but once again not supported by anything and pure wishful thinking. Mr. Chopra just plays the God card everytime he is faced with a dilemma that is unexplainable or difficult to understand. The God card in this case is more like a Joker, it serves no purpose and is just a laugh.   Mr. Chopra does have good stories to tell, but they serve no relevance to God or finding him. His writing is not bad, but it is also not very good. I find Mr. Chopra to be a very weak thinker who ignores all rational arguments and ways of logic and reason to further exonerate his wishful thinking and enforce the idea of God in his reality. If you are interesting in a book relating Science and Spirituality I would recommend Amit Goswami's "The Self-Aware Universe". I do not recommend this book at all, especially to other skeptics. Mr. Chopra not only seems to have a rather negative and close minded view of skeptics but he completely shuts them out and addresses them in a rude manner.  I have kept an open mind in reading this book, but Mr. Chopra has not, in fact he hasn't shown much evidence of an intelligent "mind" at all.   This book receives two stars just for effort and a few interesting tidbits. 
 Painful, boring, and essentially worthless textbook. It describes simple terms so badly that definitions blend together and add serious confusion when examining critically. Those experienced with the topic could barely sort out this jumbled mess, and beginners will simply be lost 
 In Defense of Secular Humanism is a collection of essays written by Paul Kurtz, mostly in reaction to allegations leveled against secular humanism (and humanism in general) by the Religious Right and other fundamentalist Christian organizations in the United States.  And therein lies the chief problem: it's a collection of essays that are almost totally focused on one central concern. Whereas many other essay collections by other authors tend to cover wide ranges of concerns (anything from war, to ethics, to religion, to sports), Kurtz's collection is focused almost entirely on answering allegations by his opponents.  And since his opponents had a habit of making the same allegations again, and again, and again, much of this book is Kurtz writing the same responses again, and again, and again.  To sum the problem up, there's a heck of a lot of repition in this book.  Of course, there are several good essays, and some excellent ones. Kurtz's "Principle of Tolerance Reaffirmed", "Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle", and "The Democratic Ethic" are very thought-provoking works to read. However, much of the book delves into seemingly mindless repition and even vitrolic rhetoric, which is, in my opinion, unbecomming of a person of Kurtz's intellectual capabilities.   Bear in mind that I do have some biases on this subject. This was my first introduction to humanism, and it's a very poor book for a first exposure. If you're like I was, and looking for something to introduce the ideas of Humanism to you, read "The Philosophy of Humanism," by Lamont.   Ultimately, I would hesitate to buy this book if I were you. If you're like me, and willing to spend the money to add this to your collections (and read the occasional very interesting articles within), go ahead. However, overall the book is intellectually unstimulating, and probably not worth most people's money. These essays just weren't meant to be put together 
 The only nice piece is Amarantine. The rest of the songs are very boring and lost some of Enya's "magic" 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 This book is a tormented stream of consciousness from a lady who was obviously fighting major demons.  It is exactly the type of book that you would expect an amateur academic to "wow" and "gush" over, as it nicely fits into the dogmatic radicalism of Chicano Studies.  The discerning reader, on the other hand, sees page after page of outdated cliches, sob-stories, and anger-filled tantrums.  Anzaldua would like you to believe her suffering and self-searching  is all the fault of the "white" culture encroaching upon the enlightened cosmic race of the mestiza.  She'd like you to think that her mestiza/chicana/lesbian/female identity is the sole cause of her misfortune and hardship.   What becomes overwhelmingly evident upon reading her unabashed torrent of decadent self-pity is the learned and self-enforced quality of her "opression".   Anzaldua helplessly wallows in her romantic fatalism dreaming of the great mestiza revolution that will fix all of the world's problems by turning the middle class value system upside down.  If you like romantic literature, and enjoy the hopeless and sorrowful ramblings of society's self-marginalized, I might suggest "The Sorrows of the Young Werther" by Goethe or some poems by Lord Byron - at least then you get some literary value 
 1. Watch the movie "Hustle & Flow." The handful of songs that are played all the way through sound good, especially the catchy and smooth "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp" and "Hustle and Flow."  2. Get CD soundtrack to film. Discover to unpleasant surprise that virtually all of the songs on it are operating on the mental level of "Whoop That Trick." (That is to say, a very low IQ level, with endlessly repetitive choruses that aren't catchy.)  3. Realize that amongst the professional rappers on the soundtrack, the best one is professional actor Terrence Howard.  4. Smile bemusedly. Sell used CD 
 I cannot imagine, being Shannon Tweeds and Gene Simmons children and picking up this book one day with the thoughts of maybe getting to know a different more in depth side of your mother. Most Biographies involve birth to the present and everything in between. I knew Shannon Tweed as an 80's movie D-Lister. She was basically in every single sitcom or drama back then as a guest star, or walk on. Her face is sort of recognizable, you might say "I know her from somewhere" but you can't place her.  She is beautiful, she is married to a rock star, and she of course is now in her own reality television show just like everyone else. This book, all 200 pages, lots of pictures, and large type is kind of pathetic. Not in a way that she herself is, but cmon, if you are going to write a "this is my story", spout some details, spill your emotions, give us something besides how you noticed your future husband was very aroused the first time you met him, and how many names you can drop. There are pictures of this woman, taken from playboy, that are full on nude Furry parts and all, I would be mortified if I was her children. There is a time and place for everything; a biography isn't one of them to show your naughty places. Tacky. I read this book, in ½ an hour, and I am not lying. It was that simple. Shannon, your shacking up with Gene Simmons, and your book is basically devoted to your boobs. 
 Although the author has a fantastic vocabulary and writes well, I feel that she veered off the subject of her CURRENT backyard too often. I had no interest in reading about the glacial age and the history of wolves in Maine and an entire chapter was dedicated to it. Nor was I interested in reports about lawns in Arizona and California, where the author had visited, or facts about the insulation in her house, and the way that fuel usage affects the environment.  However, there are interesting observations presented in a very readable manner, along the way.  If you are interested in native versus non-native plant species, you will learn about them here.  And some stories, like the relationship that develops with a chipmunk, are heartwarming.      In summation:  I felt that many of the subjects written about were not first hand experiences, but rather information that the author gleened from professionals in their respective fields.  I expected something along the lines of a  journal, and something with a stronger timetable, that would represent "A Year on the Lawn".     
 This designer clearly aims for exclamations of surprises from viewers. She has an admirable eye for color. But for real class and style, refer to and study truly great and original minds like the late David Hicks, Madeleine Castaing, Jacques Garcia, and the highly intellectual Jacques Grange. Then re-interpret to suit your life and add your own sense drama for a real originality 
 A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading 
 It was ok.  I strongly dislike the character that has an empathy for machines.  Just ridiculous.  And he was one of the cruxes of the story!  Brian Lumley's other works (Fruiting Bodies) is far superior 
 Found it to be filled with more history and statistics than what the title states is in the content of this book. The author threw a curve when he went on a rant about those who believe in the Trinity. I fail to understand how belief, or non-belief, in a triune God is relevant to the topic of end times or biblical prophesy 
 Since the total carbs are what is important for diabetics, this should not be recommended. It has 42 grams of carbs and only 4 grams of fiber per 1/2 cup of cooked pasta. This is almost the total amount of carbs allowed diabetics for a complete meal. Only 1/2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal. Who  can eat just one cup of pasta? It is very misleading to diabetics as "digestible carbs" has no meaning to them. Total carbs less fiber is what counts to a diabetic. Thus diabetics beware. If you want to eat it remember, 1/2 cup is a complete meal of carbs 
 The bike I ordered wouldve been a great Christmas present had it not been dropped a few hundred times before I received it, both fenders damaged badly, and paint scraped off the frame in 3 spots 
 I got this book after I married the son of one of the climbers killed on K2 in 1986 because I was interested and curious about his father.  This was a waste of my money.  Eiger Dreams was much more informative 
 Hope Edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. She has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. The second hole in Edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? I'll believe it when I see it. It's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. Within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that Edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant. Other than these two crucial holes, Edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. It's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own 
 I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic". 
 The book was a disappointment.As a parent I was looking for a book to show my 10 year old not to judge his autistic brother on what other people think or what he can do.The very high funtioning austistic child in the book   receives his brothers approval only after the 5 year old reads a poem for  the school and wins his brothers friends acceptance. I was able to read the  book to my 5 year old twins changing the story 
 If you have read these in the paper you are no doubt aware that Family Circus is trite and vapid. But if you think that this book somehow contains the jems that you somehow missed, please don't be fooled. I picked this up at a friends house after asking myself "why would sombody buy this?". The answer is This is the most undesirable gift to ever grace a white elephant gift exchange. If you want to see everybody scramble to get rid of a gift, just throw this waste of paper in the mix, but please don't buy it yourself 
 Mr. Irving is a renowned writer who has pleased readers with books like, The World According to Garp, Prayer for Owen Meany and Cider House Rules.  There is a creativity about his writing and a quirkiness in his characters that I find appealing.  What happened here?  I was so mired down in wordiness and child sexual abuse that my commitment to the book ended with the protagonist's early grade school sexual experiences.  If somebody walked into a person's home and found drawings of what was verbalized in the book, they would probably consider the individual a pedophile and his home would be marked on public records as housing a pervert.  It seems strange that a brilliant writer could go on ad infinitum, describing the same things in words and be considered worthy of praise.  Anything the book had to offer was lost on me because I couldn't get past being inundated with pages and pages dedicated to pathetic images of a young boy's penis; crude and rude, abusive adolescent girls; and body hair fetish.  Maybe had I been pulled in enough to read further, I would have found redeeming value in Until I find You.  As it played out for me, the book is not worthy of John Irving.       
 We should have thought about it when we ordered, I guess, but this set doesn't include 2 of the most commonly used cups, which is too bad.  We gave ours to good will and ordered a different set, alas... Other than that, though, the quality is very good 
 If you start running just now and want to run a marathon this is a good book for you. If you already have some running years of experience, and perhaps already ran a marathon, it won't help you. What is written is very basic, very well known to anyone who has already ran for a short time. I wanted help on "how to train for and run my best marathon", I didn't get it from this book 
 Self-parody at its fines 
 I was somewhat disappointed in this book despite its endorsement by one of my business school classmates.  Professor Tichy discusses already well known principles of leadership within the context of what is promoted as a "new" approach.  Only a few individuals and companies are profiled and are used repeatedly throughout the book.  The examples cited fit awkwardly into the message that is being presented.  The title of the book attributes greatness to the individuals profiled based on only one attribute--a belief in teaching and learning.  This seems such a narrow focus on which to base such accolades 
 I bought these skates for my daughter from Sport Authority.  Since we both wear the same size, I decided I would try and skate in them after my daughter.  She complained the wheels would not roll and when I tried to loosen them with a skate tool, they wouldn't loosen at all.  I tried to skate in them as well and I almost fell on my face.  I wasn't expecting the same quality as my professional skates, but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely! 
 This text was required reading for my anthropology course and although I was looking forward to learning about the subject matter, I felt that Haviland wrote in a way that made it much less enjoyable than it should have been. Often repetitive, always with his own biased version and even his terminology (using such phrases as *something like* when using descriptives)were not what I expected from someone of his caliber. To make matters worse, the *Original Study* segments which were some of the most interesting parts of the book were printed on a green background with the print lightened so that it was barely readable...what were the publishers thinking? I was greatly disappointed. 
 sinceramente, no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas, incluso renombrados artistas, hacia este musico... ungido de la leyenda GRAPE, amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura, esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados..lastima, piedad, curiosidad...no se , me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson (13th.....).. en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio.. en fin, son opiniones, nada mas.   
 the first shipment i got, i promptly shipped back to amazon for an exchange because the left channel was simply dead with nothing coming out of it. once i received the second pair of headphones (very promptly---i give amazon credit for that), i tried them out. first thing i noticed was how much noise there was on the sound quality, and also, the complete lack of any bass. secondly, the flexible wires that wrap around you ear are alright (main reason I bought this product), but the angle that the buds are attached them is a bit uncomfortable; you feel as though the speaker is slightly protruding outside of your ear cavity. but those are just quality issues, the main problem was that with two hours of use, one of the channels (this time, the right) started outputting WAY too much noise (a hissing sound) that more or less drowned out the music. i discovered that by pressing down on the wire where it was attached to the volume control, the hiss went away, and by letting go of the pressure, it came right back. these things just aren't manufactured and/or assembled very well. since this too is defective, i'm sending it back and just buying a more trusted brand. take my advice and shell out another $10; it's worth it 
 first of all, i am a christian.  and an evangelical, no less.  i share my faith on a regular basis.  in fact, it's currently my career.  i do not say these things to brag, but just to clarify that i'm not a "liberal agnostic," or whatever monsters we're all scared of, who's writing just to attack the christian worldview.  that said, my main point is not that books like this distract us from the essence of christianity: serving each other, living nonviolently and sacrificially, giving to the poor (it's appalling that we have starving people in a nation that fundamentalists claim was founded to be a christian nation--which it wasn't, but still, it's appalling), and loving all unconditionally (you know, agape, a concept that appears numerous times in the new testament while "dating" never appears).  my main point is also not that books like this turn christians into relational hypochondriacs who constantly second-guess their very natural romantic and sexual impulses, which could easily be controlled with simple common sense, and turn every natural human relationship into something forced, stilted, and unnatural.  i also do not wish to focus on the fact that the idea of "pre-marital sex" appears nowhere in the bible.  seriously, it's not there.  "adultery" (i.e. infidelity) and "sexual immorality" (i.e. promiscuity and depravity) are there, but consummating a loving, monogamous relationship (gasp!) BEFORE a formal and symbolic ceremony takes place just does not appear in the bible.  in fact, in the days of the biblical hebrews, having sex for the first time equalled getting married.  no ceremonies.  in fact, jewish marriage ceremonies are adaptations of medieval christian ceremonies which were themselves adaptations of pagan ceremonies.  if you don't believe me, read adin steinsaltz's "the essential talmud."  so, in biblical times there essentially was no such thing as "pre-marital sex."  but, as i said, all those things are not my point.  my point is, i'm 24.  i don't know anything about life.  at 21, i knew even less.  isn't it a little odd that the evangelical world is totally revamping its idea of relationships because of what an inexperienced 21 year-old is saying?  i mean, that just seems a little odd to me.  totally my opinion 
 Since this rechargable battery was clearly listed under "accessories" on the Minolta Dimage Xi Amazon WEB page, I purchased one to serve as a backup.  It was delivered well before I received the camera.  Imagine my surprise when I finally received the Dimage Xi and opened up the Sharp battery package to find that the battery was too wide to fit in the camera or the battery charger which came with the camera!  This battery is NOT an accessory that fits with the Dimage Xi.  I have sent it back 
 Unfortunately the recipes I tried from this book did not taste good and turned out rubbery.  I do not recommend it.  
 I was hoping that this book would help me create several evaluations for my training programs and I am sad to say it did not meet my expectations.  The books fails to present in detail the requirements of each level of evaluations.  Spend your money on another book with more practical guidelines 
 I bought the soundtrack with the hope that the best song on the movie - the bagpipes version of Amazing Grace at the end of the film - would be on it.  It is not.  If your objective is to get that bagpipe song, don't get the CD.  the other songs are ok, but nothing to write home about 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 There were too many characters, disjointed plot threads, not much of a plot in the first place, and not much coverage of the overall march itself.  It focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who weren't that compelling 
 To style this work of Dame Yates as historical is to do damage to the notion of history.  What the book represents, more than anything else, is an apology for the rather absurd hermetical, cabalistic Rosicrucian mythology.  As with her "Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age", Dame Yates here demonstrates a rather profound lack of foundation in reality for one who would call herself a historian.    Within the corpus of the text, perhaps more than ninety percent of the narrative deals with the esoteric aspects of Rosicrucianism and its fairly interesting connections with freemasonry, Calvinism, and Lutheranism.  That remaining small fraction that could be described as historical has to do mainly with the ridiculous attempt of the Elector of Palatine to usurp the throne of Bohemia at Prague.  In terms of historical value, a short chapter would have captured everything.  Relative to esoteric doctrine, volumes would not have yielded any rational thought.  One of the most insidious poisons transmitted in this work is that, somehow, the cabalistic Rosicrucians founded the modern European study of mathematics.  We wonder, in this context, by what formulation the Dame would explain how Descartes and Pascal, certainly the two greatest mathematicians of the age, were Catholics, and thereby diammetrically opposed to the satanic Rosicrucian doctrine.  Michael A. Hoffman II has an excellent study tape, "Magic and Paganism in the Reign of Elizabeth I", which captures all that is of historical value within this and the aforementioned works of Dame Yates.  Seekers after the truth would be much more well served by reviewing that study tape than by wading through these esoteric meanderings 
 I would just like to add my note of agreement with the reviews of Michael A. Gatto and Bill Marsano and add one additional rather major error in "Stolen Figs"; on page 92, "After Hannibal came the Longobards, the Byzantines, and, in the middle of the sixth century, the Normans,...". How's that for turning history on its head? And he's only about five centuries off with the Normans. Conclusion? A complete waste of time 
 This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read in my life. Pointless repetition page after page. This book justifies why some people unfortunately despise reading. In this case, it was like pulling teeth to read this trash. We all KNOW what this book tries to tell us. However, Lunsford feels the need to take a sentence, and expand it into 300000 more saying the exact same thing. Please do not buy this. 
 This book is a joke.  For a beginner looking for a comprehensive guide for investing, don't buy this book, unless you want a lesson in being ripped off.  This book is the size of a coaster, the kind you find next to the checkout at the pharmacy about how to get various stains out of your argyle socks.  It's made up to look cute; a two inch hardcover tomb, complete with dustjacket.  Misspellings and grammatical errors abound in this nugget.  Aspects of investing are listed, but not explained to any extent that might help someone actually pick stocks.  "A Fool And His Money Are Soon Parted," by Peter Lynch.  Buy another one of his books (a "big kid" book), but not this one 
 I like to appreciate one's art and give everyone the benefit of the doubt.  Although Wearstler has the creative team to package her, her talent leaves me feeling short changed.    If you have seen one Wearstler design, you have seen them all.  Her style is the same regurgitated interpretation of the last.  However, I will say that her "Beverly Hills Estate" is probably the best work I have seen of hers.    This book is a little over the top.  I am a fan of Beverly Hills, I am from Beverly Hills, but you will not find a Beverly Hills woman or any other woman for that matter doing domestic chores in couture gowns.     I think it is interesting that most of her projects, even the ones featured in Modern Glamour, are her own residences or hotels.  I believe she lived in the Hillcrest/Trousdale Estate, Hollywood Compound and she even acknowledges the Hancock Park/Sycamore Street apartment.    Thank goodness for Brad...he is the one who purchases the hotels.    Even BG, the Bergdorf Goodman restaurant in NY, leaves me feeling uninspired.  Kudos to the ones behind the scenes - hotelier husband, decorator/designer mother, stylist, publicist and writer.  Kelly's contributions to that of a tastemaker are not up to par with her predecessors.  But you do have to give her credit for believing in herself 
 I didn't use this particular product but the version that came with my computer which was slow but not the end of the world. The problem I had with them is that they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning that they are going to do it. I had a 2-year subscription and they send me an e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account with never telling me that I was in auto enrollment! When I called to complain they of course had someone who couldn't inderstand me and I had to spell my e-mail address THREE times and was told it would take 3-5 days for the refund to be processed which is crap because I work for an online store and its easier to void a sale and cheaper for the vendor to do a refund the same day! I asked for a manager TWICE, the second time they came back they had the nerve to ask me if I was interested in an upgrade and subscribing to their magazine, and was put on the never-ending hold until I gave up 37 minutes later which was probably the plan all along. SO I called my bank and put a stop payment on the automatic payment. Now I am searching for another protection program and calling their customer service before my purchase to see how it goes 
 This blows. Vocals blow. Guitars blow. It just blows. Deal with it! 
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters (lefties) have deleted this review Twice.  Robert Reich, was Bill Clintons scariest appointment. His ideology, ergo his politics has been the of the most extreme left of any Bill Clinton's appointments. And some may argue that he some of the most extreme viewpoints of ANY high level appointment.   Robert Reich and his ilk were very happy when from the 1940's - 1980, radical lefties was setting the public agenda. All items were in play, courts were stacked and extremist's legislatures abdicated their law making ability to the courts. The executive branch simply turned a blind eye when radical lefties created a false impression that they were supporting the constitution when in fact they were and still are systematically undermining it. Left-Wing views that were on the fringe of the Democratic Party in the Sixties and Seventies are now center stage. These views, being forwarded by people like Reich, Dean, Kerry and Feingold, seem accepted as normal.   Left Wingers - control the media, academia, the sciences, think-tanks, and for most of the last century the executive, judicial and legislative branch. Republicans were demoralized, but the pendulum has finally begun to swing the other way. People are finally getting fed up with the extremist left who is arrogantly opposed to honest intellectual debate for they are fervently certain that they are correct in all matters. Their disdain for discourse and for anybody who challenges them is extant.  But the worst part is that radical lefties are uncivil to the extreme. They fill the public airwaves and bookstores with nastiness. Listen to Air America or watch a Michael Moore DVD. Read their editorials and you will find vicious vituperative attacks. Open a leftist political best-seller and you find more mean spirited screeds. Extremist lefties, RAD-COMS (Radical Communists) typically reduce political debate to nonsensical statements that seem to be making point but are nothing but vague and angry assertions, unsupported by facts.  But what we're now witnessing is something far more corrosive of civic life than normal political vitriol: It's viciousness directed toward anyone holding a view other than the prevailing elitist left-wing propaganda. Insults also calculated to belittle and ridicule entire groups or judged to be different are part of the divisive wedge that lefties like to play in hurting the cohesiveness of the nation.  The Conservative tradition values free speech and debate. No one should be deterred from speaking his or her mind for fear of offending some group. Lefties are opposed to this idea, the shouting down of Ann Coulter the attacks on Christians, etc, etc. Are all handiworks of the left. It is their mean-spirited trash talk that fills their protge's with this HATE and ANGER of anybody not like them.  I'm sorry Mr. Reich, I used to be one of these lefties, and I know the condescension with which I was taught to look at people on the right. The attacking of American Citizens rather than ideas, the smearing of whole segments of society for some perceived ills against our ideology. This is leftism at its base. Fear and Hate driven. No. Mr. Reich it will be a sad day when you and your type WIN America. People are waking up, they are realizing that the great Democratic Party of yesteryear has been hijacked by Radicals.   Your book speaks about morals but you never discuss where the morals come from. Conservative position comes from a bedrock of factual and historical facts. They are a clear-eyed view of where America is and where we need to go. Your left wing morals come from a modernist philosophy, blown by the wind and proven to be a disaster. You biggest moral imperative is to BLAME others but that is what happens when you are ideologically based rather than historically and fact based.  I could go on and on, but MR. Reich, I used to be on the left. But the divisiveness, hate, anger, name-calling, utter compliance with leadership, no dissention, no debate, and supreme arrogance drove me away. Once one is away and in the middle you look at the two competing political thoughts and it is scary, very scary to see what you once were.   Mr. Reich, I am not an automaton, and that is what you need to usher in your America. What the conservatives need, is open honest debate, free speech, and equal time. You have a fight on your hands, one that I am hoping for my children's sake that you lose. 
 I have three complaints about this edition of Tocqueville: 1) Nowhere in the book is the translator credited.  This violates basic principles of publication and scholarship. 2) This is in fact an abridged version of the original English-language translation by Henry Reeve, dating from sometime before 1862.  Unless you want to re-create the experience of a modern Frenchman confronted with de Tocqueville's somewhat archaic French by reading the text in somewhat archaic English, I would seek out any of the more recent translations: there are at least three. 3) The ellipses, that is, the abridgements, have sometimes been made to conceal some of the author's less flattering views America. In fact I suspect this is a "patriotic" abridgement. For example, in the second chapter of part one, Heffner has omitted references to some of the excesses of Puritan law in New England which the notoriously even-handed Tocqueville had cited 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 I ordered this book over four months ago and it was never delivered to me 
 I paid for the movie and never received it nor did I get my money back from Amazon.co 
 I am a rock and roll person. I hate rap. This is a rap/pop album that first came out when I was eight; "Steal My Sunshine" was big on my list. That is still a good song, however, I don't really like their other songs. Just buy the single of "Steal My Sunshine"- it will save you money 
 This card is such a disappointment.  It is soooo sloooooow.  I use it for my digital camera, mp3 player, and ipaq.  It takes forever to copy anything to and from it 
 I've read both the book and the reviews, and it's funny how saving the children is the "it's not my fault" finger-pointing device du jour.   I don't purport to be a cross-section of America, but I have no problems getting my toddlers out of a grocery store without their Sponge-Bob cereal (my wife is a different story...she loves the stuff) and can drive by a McDonalds while ignoring the shrieks of "we want a happy meal!"     However, I am overweight.   I don't blame Kraft or McDonalds (although I wouldn't mind getting in on that cash cow once the lawsuits hit), I can perfectly well on my own decide to down the entire bag of Oreos without a 30-second ad telling me to.    Mr. Brownell's anecdotal descriptions of the effects of advertising on obesity do not create any link.   As a matter of fact (forget citation of study...but could look it up if anyone wants it) the amount of calories consumed by the average person has increased about 1% over the last 20 years, while the obesity rate has soared.   So...somehow the food industry has been plotting against my children by adding 400% more calories into that 1%?   It doesn't make sense, as do most of the arguments in the book.   
 It does not bother me when a self-help book presents itself as such and simply offers advice to its readers.  But it bothers me greatly when a "pop" psychology book pretends to base its conclusions on "scientific" evidence when in reality its conclusions are based on nothing more than flimsy anecdotes.    If you are the sort of reader that thinks anecdotal "evidence" is sufficient, then you'll probably like this book on "How a Man's Mind Really Works" (the subtitle).  But you will be fooled into thinking you're learning something new.  Here is a sample of the sort of "evidence" the author provides (or does not provide):  1. "Over the past twenty years I have been researching male and female biology . . ." (p. 270).  What, where, and when has he published?  Nothing of his "research" is cited, either here or in any other book I own on sex differences.  The author wants the veneer of scientific cover but fails to provide anything of substance for his assertions.  2. As a reference for his assertions regarding "The Biology of Commitment,"  he cites only Janet Evanovich's novel,"Two for the Dough." If that doesn't make you LOL, you are not acquainted with the amazing Stephanie Plum (who has not yet added "biological research" to her list of accomplishments). I've never before seen a supposedly non-fiction book cite fictional characters as evidence for its assertions! Have you? What does this tell you about the author's attitude toward his readers?   3. The author writes, "Supporting anecdotes and stories from individuals who have lived out biological trends are crucial, I believe, to the understanding of the male brain.  When we put hard sciences together with soft, then combine these sciences with diverse life stories, we can investigate the mysteries of a subject--in our case, the male mind--with greater confidence." (p. xix)      What does "individuals who have lived out biological trends" mean? [individuals who are alive? who were alive?].  The fact is that the "hard science" in this book is minimal: the brain structures and functions the author mentions have been known for the past 30 years.  His new "evidence" consists of stories that illustrate his preconceptions.  There is just enough of the male stereotype to provoke an "AHA!" reaction in some readers. But what percentage of men do NOT fit any particular stereotype?  Alas, the author never raises and thus does not answer such a profound question.  He's too busy with his "neurobiological research," I guess.  4. The author's sole "credentials" consist of being the author of prior pop psychology books.  His educational background is not provided.  Although he refers to himself as a "family therapist," he provides no evidence that he is licensed to practice.  He is not a member of the American Psychological Association.      If you are looking for a well-written book that contains actual scientific evidence of male-female differences, I suggest Simon Baron-Cohen's "The Essential Difference."    
 It takes a few attempts to get through this book. I read it through about 3 times before I could understand what the authors point was. It is more of a documentary then anything else. Perhaps he could have ellaborated on the  myths and ledgends, as well as zodiac references to the pyramids. Other  than that, it's an interesting read 
 Half of the book is a history of several value investors.  But this section is quite superficial in how these individuals screened/found the opportunities they did.  Little is told of how they valued the companies and how a wanna-be investor should procede in doing this themselves.  The first half of the book is ok, but again could use more help in terms of how to find prospective value companies.  Chapter 6 is about the only good chapter. It analyses WD-40 (the company).  I recommend instead "The Intelligent Investor" (2003 ed.) by the late Ben Graham and Jason Zweig.  It lives up to Buffett's praise of "...by far the best book about investing ever written. 
 I did not find this book to have any "solutions." It was simply the usual self-help book which never goes to the root of any problem 
 Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
 And I don't care anymore. If liking this album is the only way I can be cool in the world I say to the world F**K YOU!!! I never liked this album for the most part. From the first riff of "Black Dog" to the last riff of "When The Levee Breaks". There was some breaths of fresh air on the song "Going To California", but the rest of this is overplayed, and way too much requested. "Black Dog" is just annoying, "Rock And Roll" is good for the first half, but when the 3rd verse came into play it just fell flat. "The Battle For Evermore" is good for the most part, but when Plant repeats that one word over again it sounds like a cat meowing, and it gets on my nerves, then you have "Stairway To Heaven", and all the glory it's recieved as a holy hymn to Satan, but to sing it you must play it backwards, "Misty Mountain Hop" has some good sounding drums, but that's all it has going for it, "Four Sticks" the best version of the song is done by an anonymous band off the compilation "The Song Retains The Name", and "When The Levee Breaks" is a depressing lament that kills the ears, soul, spirit, and just makes you want to pull a gun out, stick in your mouth, and pull the trigger. I know that I think it's the worst piece of S**T that I've ever heard. Now that you know how I honestly feel about this album I can move on. I no longer care if you like, or hate me. I'm free. 
 I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large.. 
 First, let me tell say that I began this book with high hopes since it considered a masterpiece.  However, not 100 pages into the book, I kept asking myself why this book is considered a masterpiece.  After finishing it, I am still asking myself that very question.  I don't have an answer since this book was certainly not worth the time and effort to read it.    I entitled this review "Call me Ahab" since after getting 300 pages into it, I became obsessed with finishing the book. I was not going to let the White Whale beat me. I was not going to let that fish cause me to put down the book (even though that is what I wanted to do). I was not reading this book because I was enjoying it. I merely finished it so that I could say that I finished it and the White Whale did not win.  There is a reason that the most famous line in the book is the first one. Of the 135 chapters, there are maybe 20-25 that are worth the reading.  Of the 725 pages, maybe only 150-200 are worth reading.  I was not too terribly concerned about knowing the anatomy of whales, the different types of whales, the skeletal system of whales, or knowing about whaling in general.    Throughout the book, you may read one chapter with some action only to be followed by 5 or 6 chapters of tangents that are not necessary to understand the story.  This also happens within some of the chapters that have some action.  In the middle of a chapter with some action, Melville may go off on some tangent for several paragraphs and then come back to the storyline.    If you like a story with nonessential information and an author that is entirely to verbose, then this book is for you.  Also, if you have only one book and way too much time on your hands, this would be a good book.  However, if you like a story that has some continuity to it and a good storyline, this is not the book for you.  I think that Melville's plan was to have his writing be the White Whale and the reader as Ahab to determine if his writing would cause the reader to become obsessed just to get through it.  If this was his thinking, then it worked on me.   There are so many more books that are much, much better than this one.  If you have many books that you want to read, read them first and always place this book at the back of the line and read it when you have no other books you would rather read.   Take my advice - read another book. If not, then be prepared to become obsessed with finishing it since that may be the only way you will get though it.  My apologizes to all those that I may have offended with this review 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 I wish I had read some of the reviews for this product before I bought it.  I was SO disappointed with the quality of the product. The sheets are extremely rough, thin and scratchy. The comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one. Since Thomas the Tank Engine is such a popular character, I would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing  it's trademark. As such, I am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding 
 While this book deserves some place in history for being an early work of American fiction and it's rich descriptions of early American geography, it is intensely hard to enjoy. The basic plotline is interesting, but the execution and character development is just plain awful. At many points in the book, Cooper just glosses over action leaving a confused reader wondering just what the hell happened and how. The real killer though is the character development. The unidimensional and shallow characters are stereotypes at best, and the women in the novel are written so thin they practically disappear. One might think that Cooper had never actually met a woman before given his portrayal. The book does have points to recommend it from a historical or geographical basis, but if anyone is actually looking for a good book to read, look elsewhere 
 I am conservative on most issues but I do have some problems with our strategies in the Iraq war.  I have a very liberal friend who is in love with the term "Neocon".  He is constantly critizing me for reading "right wing" propaganda so I said I would give his idea of a great book a try.  I read a little over half of the book and I couldn't take it anymore.  I found myself dreading getting back to the book each day, to me this is just a liberal antiwar hit piece.  There are some good questions in the book on our strategies and troop deployment.  But the author's hate of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Rice take over and cloud every chapter.  He makes the Neocons sound like Dr. Evil's Chamber in the Austin Powers movies.  His referencing was always from the far left blogs and publications, he constantly referenced conversations that could never be substantiated.  My friend told me this was a historical book, apolitical, I think not.  Read it if you want to, I couldn't get through it.  Ann Coulter is an idealogue, but at least she is funny 
 There is a reason there are 247 used ones of this book.  We used this book in for our men's study group and every one of the men, and every one of the wives agreed, that this was a worthless book.  It was written for a 1950's wife that no longer exists.  Now 3 truly wonderful books to help you with your wife are:  Discovering the Mind of a Woman by Ken Nair  If Only He Knew by Gary Smalley  Together Forever: How to Overcome Problems and Rekindle the Love in Your Marriage by Anne Kristin Carroll   They are truly inspirational as to how to be a good husband 
 This book is disappointing.  While it may help a college student or other really new person grasp some of the concepts of organizing it is not useful to practioners.  The Midwest Academy used to have a very good training manual covering many issues.  As the book got slicker looking the information got worse.    Get Shel Trapp's old Basics of Organizing instead - much more useful, and free on the internet 
 this book sucks, it taught me nothing, because of this boook i faild algebra.    DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
 What a waste of my money, stories of sucesses and failures of a Real Estate salesman, how boring! Buy something else or save your money 
 i would like to know what kind of a wuss needs to use a stradegy guide for a FIRST PERSON SHOOTER!?  i mean, they're pretty straightfoward - walk forward and kill all the bad guys you see!  how hard is that!?  Halo is an awesome game but it's REALLY not hard to figure out what to do!  i mean you'd have to be a complete MORON not to know what to do or where to go.  it tells you more than once what to do during the game - you got that extrememly annoying Cortana yacking in your ear pretty much non-stop, tellin' ya what to do.  but anyway i'm done ranting at you wusses 
 Simply stated,I was not pleased.  I thought this was a compilation of various artists as well.  I was disappointed.  I really ordered the wrong album.  I wished I had read the comments before I purchased. This is probably best suited to be used as bedtime sleeping music only 
 The first part (about 1/3 of the book) is quite interesting and has a lot of eye-opening information about first years of Christianity, early Church, etc. The other two thirds you can just skip. That is why my rating is five stars divided by three 
 What a lot of self indulgent drivel. I can't believe that a great mystery writer like Rita Mae Brown actually wrote it.My computer forced me to give it a sta 
 Unfortunately I also purchased this product and within a few uses I began getting cracks in all my containers.  Plastic is very thin and is very low quality, not what I had expected from Black & Decker.  Both continers broke within a week, used only a couple of times...  I would rate this product a ZERO if it would let me 
 I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star 
 In another rehashed treatise on Savage's perverted sense of truth, he sells a miserable, peripatetic screed to his lemming-like followers.  This man's politics and principles have been condemned by such well-established conservative journals as The Economist.  We all need someone to trust, and for Savage that person is the MD who will prescribe him some thorazine.  Gets 2 stars only because of the book's educational value as an example of the ramblings of a lunatic.  Barry Goldwater must be spinning in his grave 
 This book is garbage!  Don't waste your money on the lies sold in this book.  If you want to read fantasy?  I suggest the Lord of the Rings.  The makers of this book and the movies should be ashamed of themselves for profiting off so many lies masqueraded as truths 
 The purpose of In Love With Night is to examine both the legacy of Robert Kennedy, and America's continued fascination with his tragic family. It does this by giving a biography of the man through the lens of the times in which he lived. Particular emphasis is given on his relationships with his father and his brother Jack, but the meat of the book is the conflict between the `good Bobby' and the `bad Bobby'. According to Steel, Bobby Kennedy was not the angel everyone thought he was. No big surprise there. After all, who was the angel everyone thought they were? In the end, this book seems to be about how Ronald Steel thinks the Kennedys are overrated. Again, no big surprise. Skip this one and read any of the far better books on RFK and his family 
 I've never been more disappointed in a book and I think this is the first book I've ever actually returned.  I didn't want this man to get a single penny from me.  My concerns were immediately raised when I read that he was a gunmaker and when he made the comment "I reached out to poke the radio on to a country western station.  I like to listen to songs with lyrics I can understand".  So I immediately look up bear hunting in the index and am soon horrified to read that he supports hunting and even bear hunting and tries to justify it as a valid wildlife management technique!  How he could ever raise cubs and yet still support murdering them for fun is beyond me.  Torturing and/or killing animals for pleasure is a classic sign of being a sociopath.  So if you love wildlife and bears like I do and if you're an intelligent person then you will avoid this book like the plaque.  If you want to read an amazing book about bears and two amazing people then get "Grizzly Heart" by Charlie Russel and Maureen Enns.  Unfortunately, for some reason this book isn't yet available in the US and you must order it from Canada but its worth the extra trouble.  
 if i could get my money back i would ask for it back, for this is the most useless Vaccum that i have ever gotten. it will not pick up very good at all. you have to run over the floore 8 or 10 times befor it will pick up and then it will not pick up everything. save you money and look at somthing els 
 I was a fan of this Saturday morning show when it came out,but when I started watching this I found that it wasn't near as good as I thought it was. The stories just didn't grab me like I thought they would and I found the animation to be very lackluster. I guess somethings should be left to memories. I give it two stars because my boys do seem to like it 
 I bought this recording with high hopes.  What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right?  Well, not with this recording.  The cast is made up of "distinguished actors," the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school.  Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line.  The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!  When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out.  For audio recordings, you need the best voices.  Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this.  My advice?  Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums 
 unfortunatlly i got a dvd that dosnt work.... he lagnguge is not english and when i tried changing and choosing english lang. it dosnt repond... so am stuck with i 
 I agree wholeheartedly with Kenneth Ryan's review.  This book was "recommended" reading in one of my English classes at UCLA several years ago, and I bought it, but just now picked it up for a read.  The problem is that the main character is so vapid that I simply did not CARE what happened to her.  It has always been my firm belief that one must identify with, care about, or even despise a main character to care enough to keep reading.  This novel was painful to finish; who cares what happens to these people?  I agree that whatever "splash" the book made in its day came from the shock value it would have had because of the amorality of its characters.  It's hard to shock us these days, and the book is now just plain uninteresting 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 I started this book the same way I started almost every Marquez book in the past - expecting to be mesmerized and taken away for a while from my world to one of the magical-real worlds of Marquez. The first few tens of pages of this book took off the way those in any other Marquez book do: slowly, but promisingly creating a solid loom to weave a tale on. And then the next tens of pages continued in the same vein, as did the next few chapters, and so on and so forth.   Actually, to be fair, at least a part of the problem could be with my expectations. I was expecting another stunning piece of writing, even if it was a recount of reality. But then, how many readers of Marquez would hold that against me and expect differently of him? After all, his books have been as much about his writing style as they have been about his vivid imagination, haven't they? So that's primarily what I felt let down about in this book - the book just fails to grip. Marquez's writing seems weak like never before (except for the odd brilliant phrase here and there), and there aren't enough interesting tales to tell anyway. The book never moves beyond the context-setting; there is almost no dramatic arc, and; there is hardly any climatic resolution.   To summarize quickly then, I would recommend this book to very die-hard Marquez fans only. The only real value of this book lies in helping Marquez's readers undestand how he came to be the writer he did. If you are prepared to go through 500 pages of tedium for that, go for it. 
 I've read 300 of the 362 pages and I can't be bothered to finish.  Not particularly well written.  The secondary characters are un-developed and annoying... in fact, the same can be said for the main characters.    I don't care what happens to them.  I don't care about finding out what the "mystery" is.  I can't figure out how they could possibly have fallen in love.  The author just springs it on you.  It's a bit insulting to the reader, in fact.    The heroine is passive and whiny... "[spies (or whatever) are following me and I'm going to do nothing about it except wait for them to spring on me at every tourist site and "ruin" the tourist experience for me.]"  This is my first book by this author, and unless I forget her name (it's a very bland, forgettable name) and accidentally buy something by her again, it is the last.  I'm really glad I only paid a buck for it 
 This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one.  Besides, some of it is just plain wrong.  To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:  "In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general."    Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity.  He attributes to them, two "liberal" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with.  
 This album just like all of Jessica's albums is not country. This is Nashville at it again, trying to sell pop as country. Whan will you learn Nashville that country fans like myself are sick of pop music passing itself off as country. If you like the typical nashville pop singers like, LeeAnn Rime, Shania Twain or Faith Hill. Then you are sure to love this junk. But if you are a country fan I would advise you not to buy this. But one thing I am glad about, is that her career didn't last longer than two years. Jessica you are now a has been. ~~ Twan 
 This is one of the few books where I can honestly say that the movie was better...  much better.  I was not impressed with Koontz's bad guy who was not very well developed at all.  The world is not so black and white, which makes things far more interesting 
 As David Pryce-Jones has pointed out, this book is way off base.  There is no serious attempt to discuss the real world in Ilan Pappe's book, nor is there anything to indicate to me that Pappe regards truth as a value.  And while the cover of this book includes a claim by John Pilger that Pappe is being brave to write all this, I'm not so sure that the writing of this sort of despicable propaganda even constitutes bravery.  Is this book merely a bunch of untruths?  In my opinion, it not as good as that.  After all, even if a book were to simply tell the truth about, say, Arab atrocities against Jews, carefully omitting any context for them, it would be quickly labeled as one of the most trashily racist works of all time.  This book is even worse than that, and I do not recommend it 
 I was suprised when I received The Modern Critical Interpretations edition of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner.  There are no woodcuts or any other pictures, there are no silver pages, there is no poem at all!  This book is only modern critical interpretations - nothing more.  Buy it if you are a scholar - and refer to a separate copy of the poem.  I should have known from the edition but the editorial reviews were from a different book that was an edition of the actual poem 
 This book is more like a "travelogue" through Ms. Pepe's brief (5 year) journey with MS than a useful tool in comparing alternative therapies.  She flits around between different therapies and theories and doesn't inspire much confidence in her choices.  For example, she rejects Dr. Swank's low saturated fat diet and I can surmise that it's only because she misses eating butter and red meat too much.  After all, this is a nutitionist who is used to eating steak and eggs for breakfast!  When she abandon's Swank's diet, she buys 2 lobsters to celebrate.  In her bibliography, she lists the 1987 edition of Swank's book which is the same one I read.  It allows lobster in any quantity.  Must be the butter she wanted to celebrate with!  Most people interested in alternative medicine show at least a smattering of compassion towards animals.  Not Ms. Pepe.  She ingests a disturbing amount of pig myelin which seems dangerous considering things like mad cow disease, and she uses bee venom therapy which kills perfectly innocent (and nearly wiped out) honey bees.  I was an inadvertant recipient of bee venom therapy at age 12 when a bumblebee flew up the leg of my pants and stung me 6 or 7 times on the knee.  I'm not saying bee venom therapy doesn't work, but since my knee only got terribly stiff and a bit itchy I'm not convinced it does anything positive for your joints.    I would love to see a book that did a thorough and dispassionate examination of alternative therapies.  I've read of a study that showed regular yoga helping alleviate the fatigue associated with MS.  Yoga has helped me and so has acupuncture although it got expensive and rather time consuming.  Nutrition and supplements have helped as well.  I would love to hear more about MS and meditation.  It seems to me that meditation could help greatly with stress and it's exacerbation of MS symptoms.    I often refer to MS as the Mystery Sickness because it is so hard to pin down.  Ms. Pepe is one of those irritating people who claim to know it all and be 'cured'.  It's a shame really because the does the cause of alternative medicine more harm than good with this self indulgent book of hers 
 I've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe. However, in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday (blue with red and silver) is synthetic.  Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price, you receive a leather shoe! You are not "saving $50" if it's synthetic 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 Having read previous works on notions of blackness in America from historical figures W.E.B. DuBois, Booker T. Washington, Frederick Douglas, sociologist William Julius Wilson, and activist Angela Y. Davis, I started from a perspective that Dickerson's work would be at the level of these noted authors.  After getting through the introduction, however, I realized my mistake.  The work is not a scholarly compilation of syllogistic conclusions.  Rather, it is a work that Ms. Dickerson can confidently claim as her own.  Assumptions are based upon false premises that lead readers to conclusive arguments derived from erroneous logic. The thickness in verbage that includes slangy tone is rather demeaning as one sloughs over Ms. Dickerson's opinions that come off first as xenocentric but later are diffused.  
 This is a rather peculiar film for Seagal, and the first thing that should be pointed out to any Seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film.  Seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief.  In fact, they are extraordinarily brief, though thankfully free of wirefu.    Though Out of Reach is by no means a total failure (it's actually pretty entertaining, Seagal as always is fun to watch, and some of the scenes are well done), the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes.  This film is a drama about a nature nut (Seagal) who roams the forest looking for injured animals.  He has a pen pal in Poland, a young girl, and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her, even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her.  This brings up the main problem with this film, namely, a lot of it simply doesn't make any sense.  It turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring, and Seagal goes through the motions to save her.  As per usual with Seagal nowadays, he obviously refused to actually finish the production, and so we have the usual dubbing problem here.  It is even more salient than usual in this picture, however, for here we have not one, but several different people dubbing Seagal's voice, none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him!  Here the most frequently heard fill-in for Seagal sounds like a knock-off Benecio Del Toro with a much higher-pitched voice.  As you can imagine, the effect is very humorous.    As stated above, the main problem with this movie is that it simply doesn't make sense, which was apparently realized by the director, as he has, in many scenes, the voice fill-in for Seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking! How obnoxious!   Seagal's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal, which she later uses to communicate with Seagal.  What makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for Seagal, the villian, ineptly played by Matt Schultz, sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for Seagal to find! In one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code.  (Apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means "This is a trap.")  The villain sees her doing this, and, instead of destroying the message (which would make sense), later has it delivered to Seagal! Huh? In a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling Seagal where she is, the villian sees her doing it, comments on how clever she is, but then leaves the message!   There are also quite of few mistakes in this film, several of which are laughably obvious.  At the beginning and end of this film, for example, Seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy, black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head.  During the rest of the film, however, he has short hair.  At the end, after some BS macho dialogue about how Seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing Schultz slowly, each character uncocks his pistol even though Schultz's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock, and even though in the very next closeup Seagal's pistol is still cocked! After a sword fight, which ends on a classic move from older chambara films, notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor, and that then, all-of-a-sudden, there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters.    In the finale, the above-mentioned sword fight, the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than Seagal.  This brings up another frequent complaint of many Seagal fans: his overuse of stunt doubles.  It's almost so bad now that one could say that he doesn't even film his own fight scenes now.  Have you ever noticed that in Lord Steven's early films, when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves? Now what happens? The camera gets as close as possible, shows some shots of his face grunting, shows some arms playing paddycake, then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing Seagal's face.  Ever wonder why? It's because, surprise, surprise, that's not Seagal doing the fighting.    In the gun fight, which is actually a very decent action scene, watch Seagal as he enters the room.  His character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll, which is probably the simplest move in aikido, though it is obvious that it is not Seagal doing the roll.  What is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film, which shows Seagal's character "roaming the forest looking for injured animals," or whatever, it is clearly not Seagal that we see walking through the forest.  Was he afraid that he'd trip over a branch and injure himself? Was he afraid he'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods? I don't know.  What is likely the case is that Seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact, using another actor, in order to make the film work.  I'm really not bashing Seagal, I'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could VERY easily be fixed.    Be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when Seagal goes to the post office.  The postal worker calls Seagal "Mr. Delacraw," or some such bizarre name, even though his character's name is actually Billy Ray Lancing.  Seagal then proceeds to mumble some French to the man, and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent.  This scene is downright strange.  What is also strange is how Seagal is dressed in this scene--like some kind of New Orleans Anne Rice fan, vampire wannabe in a strange, black fur coat.  I don't know, at least it's good for a laugh.   If Seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable.  The only truly schocking thing is that this hasn't happened yet.  He shows up late to shoots, leaves early, refuses to finish productions, and yet people keep hiring the man.  He repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production.  He needs to start finishing his films.  In closing, Out of Reach only has two VERY brief fight scenes, but they are somewhat well done.  Seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight, which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human.  
 The information presented about the training schedule of Bruce Lee is very complete.  The problem with this book is that there is a lot of repitition.  It could have about one fourth the number of pages that it is.  It lacks what I was really after-Bruce's philosophies.  Overall, this is not worth the money, you can easily find the information from this book on the internet somewhere.  
 Some journalists write excellent history.  Others produce mediocre but acceptable historical books.  But some are simply awful, like Thomas Laird, who tried hard to write something profound but failed.  Having seen the substantive criticism from experts, one could hardly believe the bad reviews were true, but they didn't reveal just how badly this is done.  Besides the multitude of factual errors, it's stylistically annoying--as if Laird were trying to write a screenplay for Oliver Stone, another propagandist with an agenda who cares little for facts if they get in the way of the story he wants to tell.  
 Most of the authors of this book say, in effect, that they are accused of being anti-American.  By right-wing fanatics!  But that in fact, they are merely stating unpopular views, and are in fact simply being honest.    Unfortunately, the truth is that these folks are totally dishonest.  And, in some cases, they are unpatriotic as well.  On top of that, some of them unequivocally support right-wing Islamic fanaticism.  What they frequently appear to want is not academic freedom but the right to engage in academic dishonesty, often in a misguided attempt to hurt a few Jews.  We start with a spectacularly dishonest article by Beshara Doumani.  He moans that "pro-Israel lobbying groups" and others are "policing what can be said about Israel on campus and in public discourse."  Obviously, anyone who has been on a few major American campuses can see that the anti-Israeli folks have been far more effective at doing just this.  He says that Lawrence Summers "effectively equated criticism of Israel's policies with anti-Semitism."  That's a lie.  He then defends the infamous anti-Israeli professors at Columbia University, who in real life substitute racist propaganda for scholarship in the classroom.  And he dismisses criticism of this attack on academic standards as the work of right-wing groups, pro-Israeli groups, and donors.  Even if some criticism of all this dishonesty were from such groups, that would not invalidate it!  He tells us to speak and act before it is too late.  I suggest we all do just that, and speak out against him.  There are a couple of interesting discussions about the extent to which a professor's "extracurricular" work should be protected.  My feeling is that it should be.   Noam Chomsky is used as an example.  I happen to think that Chomsky ought to have a right to tell outright lies as part of his extracurricular activities as long as he does not commit any felonies.   Others feel differently about this, and still others feel that even outright academic dishonesty in one's professional work ought to be okay (something I disagree with completely).  By the way, speaking of felonies, we do see a reference that Sami al-Arian was "disciplined for a statement concerning terrorism."  But no mention is made of the enormous amount of evidence that al-Arian had long been a terrorist leader.  In fact, that evidence finally got al-Arian fired.  Are we now supposed to excuse felons, dismissing their crimes under the mantle of academic freedom?  I hope not.  Judith Butler repeats the slander that "any criticism of Israel" is called anti-Semitic by quite a few folks.   And she complains about criticism of the notorious International Solidarity Movement.  If she wants to make a case for something, I think she ought to be far more honest.   Kathleen Frydl attacks the idea of withholding funding from universities if their expenditures promote "violence, terrorism, or the destruction of any state."  Now, maybe the wording of such an idea needs some work.  But I think it is completely proper to try to stop universities from spending taxpayer money on pro-terrorist propaganda.    Amy Newhall is worried about the United States attaching strings to some language programs.   But I think she's the problem here.  There are programs that the United States government supports to teach, for example, Arabic in universities.  The government does so in the hopes that at least a few students in such programs will use their knowledge of the language to work for the government.  If the university encourages them not to do so and we wind up without any benefit from those programs, I think there is no reason to continue them: let the universities use their own money to teach Arabic in that case.  Perhaps the most vicious article is by Joel Beinin.  Beinin seems to attack everyone who opposes the substitution of dishonest propaganda for scholarly work, calling such opposition the work of people he dubs "the American Likud."  He says "this is not the first time right-wing fanatics have waged a campaign of vilification, guilt by association, guilt by ethnic or religious affiliation, and delegitimization of dissenting opinions."  And in this regard, he mentions HUAC and Joe McCarthy.  But in fact, it is Beinin himself who is doing all this, in the service of right-wing fanatics no less.  A special target of Beinin is a particularly praiseworthy organization, Campus Watch.  This organization exposes some of the disinformation and incitement we see on campus, but Beinin claims that what it reports is "false and brazenly bigoted."  It is neither.  Once again, Beinin appears to accuse others of what he himself is guilty of.  This book pretends to be defending academia.  In fact, it is defending academic dishonesty.   This dishonesty is a threat to ruin the reputations of plenty of academic departments and possibly discredit entire fields of study.  I think we should all encourage the academic community to fight against such violations of academic standards. 
 We rented this movie, knowing it wouldn't be an Oscar winner or anything. I've seen some bad movies based on video games and comic books, but this took the cake. It was so lame! We thought it would at least be entertaining...no luck there. The best part about it was when it ended. What a relief! 
 I love the Saint and I enjoyed watching the episodes contained on Set 1 of the Saint.  However, I was terribly disappointed when I found out that Set 1 only contains 6 episodes.  Effectively, the price for Set 1, is the same as an entire season of many other great shows.  I think that this is a real rip off!  I'm certainly not going to buy more Saint DVDs until the producer brings down the price to a more reasonable range.  
 I only give this two stars for the illustrations and suspect that the main reason this book is bought is because of the Caldecott Honor.  While I look for books that have strong female characters, I cannot recommend this story.  There are many violent images -- a man caught in a bear trap, a multi-day wrestling match with a bear -- which, IMHO, are too much for young children.  We shouldn't be teaching our girls or our boys that to be a giant and wrestle bears is how girls get to be the equal of boys 
 I couldn't wait to get the ball, having an extremely active Boston Terrior. The package arrived, opened it, and there were stickers all over it saying supervise your pet and not to let them chew the rubber tips off! I reviewed the add on Amazon and nowhere did it say that they should not chew off the tips. Dogs are dogs, if they catch something jumping around the first instinct is to bite it. I think the J-B Wholesale Pet supplies should have a warning before buying item page 
 I've said it before, feminists are too often their own worst enemies. Not only do they apparently presume to speak for all women, as perhaps subconsciously does Ms. Nead, but they frequently take a platform that is both dour and too stringent. Her contentions here in The Female Nude are extreme. She is all-but critical of sexuality itself, all but denies that there is any non-sexual beauty in the human body, chides lust as an institution (no, I could not type that with a straight face) and contrary to her goals of championing women she in fact attacks women much more ardently than most any man ever would. Really this is not an overview of western female nudity in art and photography at all. There's little to be learned here, and the overall tone to this message leaves you feeling like you've just sat thru a sermon, or at best one of those college lectures where the professor was a bit too dogmatic in her approach to conveying the subject matter. Heck, even the photographs in here were bad choices. Nead won't be able to market this to either voyeurs or the intellectually curious. This book seems intent upon punishing its reader and is yet another "get the message in first" example of attacking rather than studying; of overtly delivering a message instead of neutrally expounding upon what could have been an engaging topic. 
 Oh my, this movie was God-awful. It has the feel throughout of a group of first time actors playing medieval dress-up and dragons for the camera. The special effects consist of computer-generated dragons and an extreme overuse of people's backs getting set on fire... that's pretty much it. The plot is also very weak and so typical. The fighting scenes are horribly choreographed and the acting is so bad that it looks like first time efforts for every actor except for the two kings and Theldag. Picture Ben Stiller with a slight beard, medieval clothes, and a wig. That's the hero in this calamity of a movie. There's also the typical trite and very poor attempt at humor spattered throughout also. This is definitely a low budget title. It's also in 4:3 full screen only. I consider this movie purchase one of the worst I have ever made, but it was cheap. You get what you pay for 
 Why would Whoopi Goldberg be starring in such a stupid movie, and why would Alexa Vega starring in this movie. I can't believe this movie was ever made 
 "Our Kind," Kate Walbert's novel-in-stories about the psychological malaise afflicting women who became adults in the 1950s and who are now confronting life in their 60s, never achieves its intriguing premise.  Walbert's individual stories lack coherence; her prose tends to be overwritten, precious or overly obscure; her characters rarely invite sympathy or compassion, much less understanding.  Though Walbert intends "Our Kind" to provide insight into the genuine existential dilemmas aging women experience, the novel is really little more than a litany of sorror that poor little rich girls  --  now women  -- encounter.  Each character, whether she be physically disabled, ditzy, an artist, a widow, cancer-stricken, jaded or booze-addled, has been "led down a primrose lane, then abandoned somewhere near the carp pond."  Forsaking intellectual aspirations and career possibilities contemporary women now presume as birthrights, these erudite, Smith-educated, polished (like prized apples) and repressed (orgasm-starved) characters chose or had chosen for them a life of taking "dictation from war heroes in grey suits."  Their college curriculum consisted of the "3 G's:  Grace, Grooming and Grammar.  Some of us dropped out before Grace."  They did everthing their men asked them to:  be homemakers, silent hostesses, acquiescent sexual partners and mothers.  Yet, somewhere, by middle age, the wheels had fallen off.  The women of "Our Kind" keen with pain and betrayal.  Their collective voices form a chorus of sorrow and lament, not the presupposed aria of joy, contentment and fulfillment they had envisioned hearing.  "Our Kind" is a filled with an ineluctable sadness and no small amount of unresolved bitterness.  The women, budding with excitement in their 20s, now have gone to seed.  And what a disparate assortment of seeds...hair greying, unspoken anger bubbling over, regrets denouncing false hopes.  Their loneliness slaps them daily across their reconstructed faces.  Each character, because of Walbert's preculiar, ill-chosen style, never fully articulates her angst.  Yet, we can imagine them in their earlier lives, seated at their elegantly-arranged dinner tables, designing and executing parties to further their husands' careers, painfully aware that genuine conversations (like those savored with their professors in the Seven Sister Colleges) will never involve them.  Their very lives are in perpetual deferment.  All the elements for significant story telling are here.  Walbert's bon-mots, sprinkled at the end of each chapter ("our hearts worn down by the slow drumming of blood," "we are...a school of fish too old to spawn but desperate to swim back upstream"), indicate a writer with great talent.  Yet, "Our Kind" disappoints.  Its structure, lack of narrative drive and choice of affluent, suburban, east-coast women (far removed from most American women's experiences) doom to the novel to be as satisfying as a furtive tryst with a hired pool boy 
 Nicely drawn characters; good writing; different and compelling story. Why don't I like it, then? Because of what the author did with these things. It ends in disaster and proves nothing. Afterwards, I find that this novel lingers in the mind like a bad taste in the mouth. I wish to God I'd never read it 
 This book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships.  Heinlein is so different here than in his good books (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers, Door into Summer, or Orphans of the Sky) that I wondered who actually wrote this awful work.  It seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti-woman. The basic premise is what would happen with a man's brain in a female body.  Maybe a good concept, but it is terrible in application here.  I just hated this book. I was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work. Please consider avoiding this work.  Perhaps every writer deserves some grace, but this work is almost beyond redemption.  Maybe Heinlein was ill while writing this, or maybe his editor was on drugs?   
 That so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me. Luckily, I bought this book used, otherwise I might be kicking myself for paying full price. Between her utterly uninspired "devotional dances" to things such as sex, wisdom, and the "Sticky One" (a term she made up for the astral body), and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to "anoint" it, I was unimpressed, to say the least. However, driving on a trip a friend and I got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book. It's very, very amusing if you don't take it seriously. The thing that makes me sad is that she's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth. There's nothing evolutionary about it, unless you consider being a wanton, idiotic freak "evolutionary". If this is what humanity is evolving into, I am frightend 
 God, i tried 4 times to get into this series and just could'nt. I love the authors other works.. but this one was too "much" for me and i just could'nt get it. I will come back to it in 6 months and see if i can read and finish it. 
 BEWARE..............This is a "little" girls camisole, and CHEAP looking 
 I think this book is suited for the person who is just getting started in the realm of computer security. This is due to the fact that there is quite a bit of non-Linux specific security tips, like physical security. The downsides to this book are many. Lots of file output and lots of resources to look up but not a lot of content. It just seemed to me like most of this book was filler and I didn't get anything out of it. This is perhaps because I have been involved with Linux and computer security in general for a few years. So, from an experienced systems administrator's point of view: everything in this book is available on the web and can be easily found. However, if you are new to Linux systems administration and security and don't know where to go, this book could be for you 
 This book is not clearly written.  Many terms are used incorrectly or in a very questionable manner.  The answers in the back of the book for all odd-numbered "homework" problems and all test questions is very helpful and convenient.  If I were chosing a textbook, it would not be this 
 John Patrick knows very little about the game of craps from a mathematical point of view. His book is a lot of hot air about discipline and walking away when you're ahead but you coul dbe ahead after the first bet! There's a lot of sound and fury in this book but it signifies you should look elsewhere for craps guidance 
 she is just right for me i know im a little to hot for her but i think wed make hollywoods cuttist couple 
 This is so far one of the most boring Nora Roberts books, ever.  It was OK but it seriously was a PUSH to get through it, and usually I simply just fly through her novels.  The characters are very flat and uninvolved.  I was able to guess whodunit way before the act was even done, as well as guess some of the plot twists.  The book was fun for the trip to Hollywood-land but besides that it was a LONG book (528 pages) that really would have been better off slimmed down.  Lots ado about nothing which leads to boring repeat events and pointless happenings that in the end you discover served no purpose at all to the story.  If you are a NR fan, you may like it but I suggest perhaps finding another novel to read first and borrow this one from a friend.  
 I am a student of Acupuncture currently working on a BSc degree in Oriental Medicine and bought this book for a research project on Acupuncture and Pain Management. Even though the author is a practiving Doctor of Naturopathy as well as Osteopathy, he has very little insight into Acupuncture. He calls TCM theory and diagnisis - which is the basis of successful Acupuncture - "antiquated Chinese mythology". Page 9 reads: "I (the authhor) maintain that much of what traditional acupuncturists hold to be true consists of theories and quaint explanations steeming from Chinese mythology and antiquity. The value of these to an age not versed in modern scientific terminology is obvious." One the same page ee also remarks that "Myths and antique phraseology are often perpetuated as a result of an inability to see what is real in the vast literature that has grown around this subject...". No TCM diagnosis is applied, no point selections guidelines are given, no treatment formulas suggested. The title of this book is misleading. It should be called "sticking a needle where it hurts - a guide for the ignorant". 
 Here began the death of all substantial poets 
 I purchase this itam for a Christmas gift for my Mother. I received it on 11-6-06. There is 4 broken pieces. I contacted customer service and the rep. kept reading the return policy that the whole set had to be returned. The Supervisor refused to get on the phone. I wrote an email and complained and I told them the reviews indicated Amazon worked with other customers to replace the broken pieces. I recieved, this morning, an email stating I had to return the whole set. I don't under the problem since they sell the individual pieces on their wed site. The set is pretty but not worth the aggravation. 11-9-0 
 I didn't find this book so useful. My dogs refuse any otherkind of food except their freshly cooked chicken i prepare for themevery night.  Although I tried to follow some advises from this book, I saw that they prefer to starve than eat anything else.I thought they would die since they didn't eat anything for 2-3 days and gave up! The author insists that it's a matter of time that your dog will get used to the new diet, but I see that it is not.  I think it has to do with the personality of each and every dog, and that's the reason I will never get a book like this. They don't change their nutricion no matter what I do, so I prefer buying books which deal with their psychological world and ways to communicate with them, instead of books which actually waste my time reading them 
 This book is a poor attempt at proving evolution.  While I don't believe in evoltion but do believe in natural selection, I could still give a better argument for evolution than Mr. Raymo provides.  Even though I had to endure the little evolutionary stabs he throws in to the mix here and there I did enjoy the history and the way he describes the beauty of nature. 
 listening to this you will not be able to stay awake more than five minutes. it should come with a warning label advising not to drive a car or lift heavy things. pop this in while cruising i-95 in joisey and you'll be plugging up that left lane with bruce inspired slowness for miles. and do not lift anything heavy if you value your toes. yet another snoozefest about depression, oppresion and poverty from rocks poorest billionaire. zzzzzzzz 
 I was required to purchase this with my new computer. I thought I'd give it a chance at work. We have a dedicated wired network, which just requires that you register the machine's MAC address with our DHCP server. Nice and simple, and very much like the LAN in any home where the user has a NAT router.  I plugged in the network and tried to get the MAC address. Vista would only give me the wizard to connect my network. OK, I tried the wizard. It offers to let me setup PPPoE with a username and password. That's it, no other options. I asked for other options, and it only offered that I use a modem (that I did not have in my computer.) No options for a dedicated network at all, that I could find.  I went to another machine (on the 'net) and searched Google. None of the Microsoft sites were helpful in any way. Lots of PR posturing, but no useful information or troubleshooting.  I gave up, found the license and install disks for Windows XP, and downgraded the new machine. It was far, far easier. 
 Being in the movie industry, I can assure you, I forced myself to watch it until the end to understand how bad a movie could be as this one is best example! this is a boring, stupid and pointless... sorry I can't call it a movie as it would be an insult to the real ones! Jayne Mansfield... why the hell she accepted to be in it??? was she so desesperate to get some money? Oh well I guess this movie is certainly the worst movie ever so if you want to know what's a bad movie, watch it, seriously.. 
  A few caveats.  I'm very liberal, and I've read most of the Warshawski series.  But this book is trying even my patience.  Last night I thought, I can't possibly be on p. 260 and not yet have a plot other than rich people are bad, and poor people are only hard-working and noble.  It can't be.  And it can't be that the plot so far is that the idealistic teenage heir (Romeo) of the rich bad guys--who own a not-so-veiled Wal-Mart-like retail giant--has fallen for the poor Latina (Juliet).  Sadly, though I'm supposed to, I don't care for Romeo or Juliet.  Nor do I care for any other character at this point, even Vic, who's doing all the same stuff she normally does (pissing off rich people, having Lotty tend to her wounds and then dining with her, taking the dogs out, arguing with Mr. Contreras) but to no end and exceptionally boringly.  I've read this stuff before, many times.  Get to something interesting!  This is really painful to read 
 This book does not represent the views of any of the Catholics I know, so I am left to wonder whether Mr. Johnson is appealing to some obscure hard-lined fundamentalist faction in the church. This book's contents particularly saddened me because the Catholic Church--being a church comprised of highly educated clergy--has historically accepted evolution.   I first learned about church views of evolution from my grandfather who was a Professor of paleontology (The study of the fossil record of past geological periods) at a well-respected Catholic University. My grandfather was a believer in evolution and a Third Order Dominican, simultaneously. Catholics who believe in evolution accept that our belief in God, the Bible's teachings and evolution are compatible. God is great and mysterious and God's universe (history included) is great and mysterious.   In addition to being neither enlightened nor insightful, Mr. Johnson's "scientific" arguments show that he has a very shallow, piecewise understanding of evolutionary biology and its theories. I'm qualified to say this because I am both a Catholic and an evolutionary biologist.   It is difficult to see so many other readers applauding such linear and fundamental thinking. Darwin was brilliant and Mr. Johnson is not.  
 Nobody is saying that Stalin and company where bad men. Yet the USSR's people were the main victims of his dictatorial policies. I do not know of any such murderous policies (although very repressive) against the countries occupied by the Soviet Union. Let us also consider the fact that 3.5 million out of 5.6 million Red Army POW's were murdered, 16 million Soviet civilians killed, a racial war of annhiliation launched. The Soviet Union perpretrated nothing of the sort on the German population. The limited rape, looting, and plunder on German soil was understandable though it was not deliberately perpetrated nor was it officially encouraged. This virulent anti-Soviet propaganda has become very popular with neo-Nazis and the crazy cold warriors but is somewhat tolerated unlike Holocaust revisionism.As Iosif Stalin said as early as 1942: "Hitler's come and go but the German people continue on" 
 I had been using this lotion warmer/dispenser for about six months when it broke.  The heating element still works, but the pump no longer produces lotion when pushed, rendering it useless.  Also, before it was broken, it was necessary to fill the well nearly full in order to get any lotion out, which meant refilling it nearly every week.  I don't recommend it 
 What verbiage! Get to the point! I'm sorry; I read and re-read and still have no clear idea what the author is trying to say.  The author could have saved much paper by writing one clearly stated sentence--and been done with it.  If I see the word inflected one more time--well I already screamed. It does have some neat pictures from the Fritz Lang movie. And while I have seen the Verhoeven Nasty Girl movie (and liked it and found it quite interesting), it seems out of place to put its commentary in a book along side Wagner's Ring, Lang's movie and the book Das Nibelungenlied. 
 This is the first book I've not been able to put down - not because it was so riveting, but because I couldn't wait to be done with it. It reads like a grocery list of domestic issues that might be intriguing for an adolescent or, perhaps, for someone who has never left their small town and dreams of the dramas that they assume lie in the big city. The themes, problems and experiences of the Stassos family are so completely generic that, should the book be interpreted into any visual form, it would take the shape of the most heavy-handed after-school special ever made!  And as for the "poetic" prose that is attributed to this novel: the use of language is over-the-top and often pretencious. Many experiences are not simply stated, but are rather coated with words that only add weight rather than description or meaning.   One example that I underlined: "'I'm always careful,' Ben said, in exactly the spirit he would toss a too-small offering -- a hibiscus blossom, a pomegranate -- into a crater." WHAT?!!!  Granted, the context is missing, but even in the context, this quote made me laugh. And by the time i came to the last third of book, the laughter was all that got me though to the end (that, and the fact that I had to finish it because I told someone that I would.)  If I could give this book less than one star, I would.  
 We find Macaulay's books intriguing and so proceeded to order the kit for our 11 year old daughter.  She loves science, does experiments on her own at home, elects to attend science camps every summer, and wants to be an engineer.  She found the instruction cards attractive and easy to follow BUT  "half the things didn't work" and "it was boring". She was extremely disappointed with the kit as she painstakingly followed instructions, and attempted to troubleshoot and adapt the models when she found they wouldn't work. My husband and I are an electrical engineer and a physician respectively, and we too were unable to shed any light on the problems she was having. We definitely would advise parents NOT to buy this kit 
 I don't understand this product, the picture and description clearly shows a bottle with a sprout pourer, yet I only received the bottle without the sprout!  Careful how you go about ordering this 
 "Journey of the sparrows" was alright.  It relates to my  ancestors life.  At the begining I was really into it then around chapter 8  or 9 it got very boring.  The escaping from Mexico in a  crait and hieding  in the streets was intersting. Then When that lady took them a little  intencity was taken away.  Then when she got the job and was being harrased  I got more interesed again.  Fran Leeper writing style is great.  She makes  you feel like part of the book 
 I was so excited when I recieved this humidifier at my baby shower. But after several tries, I finally returned it. This product has a sensor so it turns on and off automatically. Well, the darn thing is so loud that each time it turns on, my baby wakes up crying!!! Note that I live 2 miles from an airforce base, and the planes don't even wake her!!!! Don't buy this product 
 I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like "what just happened!". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense.  Also leaving out important elements of the story. Such as when the Wiccan Witch is talking about who would stand against the Bad Guy in Portland she completely left out Mt Angel and the so-called warrior monks as an ally. Granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the Monks. They sound interesting but are ignored, I guess being Christians is not worth writing about. Why are they ignored? Their premise is as I said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages.  There seem to be no faults in the utopian "good guys" world. There are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect. Except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young A-Lister and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off Mike Bearkillers skills at being a leader to the English Chap. Of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again. The Characters are just too simple even the Heroes.   Although I like Mike his wife and the English trio they are interesting. Hordle is one of my favorites but I am left with an empty character in the end. Of course the English trio and Cpt. Nobbes went from the coast of Africa to Portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly. As I said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around South America or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story? I don't know it just beamed them to Portland without an answer to just simple questions. Did they get the Prince to safety? I guess I am left to make up my own story.  The mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing. I can not say much about them because I just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me. We can not find out what happened to the Prince of Wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots. I have nothing against wicca I know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing I would want to know. That might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me, and I am not a Christian either really more agnostic I guess I know why now. I think the old Roman Gods would be more fitting, Mars and Jupiter, Gods of War and the blade and bow and stuff such as that. Just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest. I felt I was being fed religious propaganda half the time when reading about the disfunctional "Clans". Either they were either Lord of the Rings heroes or Druids I do not know really know which I could not read the nonsense.  But it is his story and I am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too. Of course there are some huge gaps missing:  What happened to the US Army, Marine Corp, US Navy? For 60 years the US military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force. They just went poof? The Dark Lord in Portland would have been far better as some egotistical General carving out his own slice of the pie. Tacoma Washington is home to one of the largest US Army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation? Not to mention the numerous Naval Bases throughout the area. At least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got VXed or something. Because to be honest I would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400. But that is just me, not my story.   That is just one huge gap I kept asking about but never found an answer.  I love the premise of the story I just think it was badly presented. No offense to anyone that loves it 
 Connie (or Connee) was the heart of the Boswell Sisters, the most entertaining and potent of the various sisters who were among recorded music's first, and most popular, stars. Their late 1920s-1930s recordings are full of snap, verve, charm and energy. Great voices blended together, with Connee leading, and some superlative arrangements, made those records sound as good today as they did when new. The  This pair of CDs offers nothing like those sprightly sounds. Lazy, even lugubrious, arrangements and tepid vocalizing create mostly dreary performances. The duos with Bing are better, but if you like the Sisters, as I do, this just ain't gonna cut it. If you like the Big Band sounds of the 40s, with a vocalist up front and a "pop" sound, maybe you'll like it better.   Compare her "Concentratin' on You" with the same song performed by Blanche Calloway. Blanche is crazed and confused, as the song requires, a woman intoxicated by love and incapable of living her day to day life. Connee sounds like an accountant describing the tax benefits of an offshore investment. Her Dinah, a favorite of mine from the Sisters, is a ho-hum afterthought. I bought this CD based on these other reviews, but I just don't much care for this sound. Sleepy, casual, and without conviction. No matter how good her voice was
