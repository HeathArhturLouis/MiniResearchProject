 I have two 8" picture frames that are other brands, and they are GREAT and I use them for Open Houses all the time! I got this one as a gift from a friend, and it is terrible!! The instructions are difficult to understand. The wide screen makes everyone in the picture look FAT and distorted! This is a weird size and I am not happy at all!! I don't recommend it 
 So sad I spent the money on this book.  Poor writing, comedic style that simply isn't funny, unrealistic and trite dialogue, foundering story line... I'm a third of the way through the book and no one has died yet and nothing's been stolen--there's no mystery yet!  I too have a Mennonite heritage and my relatives would kick her right out of Hernia for her blase' attitude about her religion... I picked up the book hoping for some simple, clean fun taking place in a familiar community.  Instead I was irritated and bored.  Sorry, but no dice.  Won't even be finishing this terrible book.  Run away 
    I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY FUNNY and it was in a very few instances.      Overall, I was disappointed and glad it was a short read 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 As many reviewers have indicated, this book is not nearly as good as Patterson's earlier works.  Is it possible Patterson now employs a ghost writer?  For people who enjoy thrillers, his first few books are fun. Don't bother with recent ones, though 
 What's the deal with glorifying gangster behavior?  This cat is a poor role model for youngsters with his swagger and gangster affectations.  The author needs to straighten out this feline 
 These are great towels if you can get them.  They are very soft and a great price but I ordered them in December and they came in one at a time. Took over 3 months to complete the order and still did not recieve the full order because after 3 months they refunded my money on one towel that was out of stock.  When I ordered them they stated that they were in stock and ready to ship. Buy these only if you have a life time to get the 
 As a Lenny Bruce fan, I know why someone should see it.  Owning it, however, is a somewhat empty gesture.  Most of the action consists of random b.s. film clips playing while a Bruce voice over plays.  Like seeing random movie cowboys talk to a horse or a guy on a beach while listening to "Religions, Inc."?  Then go for it.  When the footage is of Bruce, it's worth seeing.  It's too bad that sequences featuring Bruce are few, far between, and oftentimes too brief.  I would rather have an unedited tape of whatever Lenny footage one could scrounge up, laid on a VHS tape than to own this.  I own it, though, and am glad I do.  It's the best that can be done.  There are some bits on here that I haven't heard elsewhere, and it is nice to see Lenny Bruce in action.  It's just too bad there aren't quality products on the market that can accomplish this.  I wish they would make a Lenny Bruce best of tape that is somewhat sensical.  This thing is more like a lame head-shop film 
 Unfortunately, just like most books of its kind (histories of specific firms written with full cooperation from the firm involved), "The Perfect Store" is way too obsequious to eBay's official "party line", and doesn't engage in real, hard-hitting, investigative journalism.  Moreover, the book is severely out of date -- it tells you nothing about the last several years of eBay, and in a sector that changes as fast as internet commerce, this is a serious problem.  The book is well-written and competently organized, but that doesn't make up for the substantial problems with the quality and timeliness of its conents 
 This is not a rating of the magazine - just a warning to check your Wish List address if you "wish" for magazines.  My son changed his address in his Amazon account when he moved 2 years ago within the same city. Amazon did not use this information to update his address within his Wish List. When I ordered $138 worth of magazines from his wish list last December, Amazon hid the street address "for privacy" - therefore I could not know the magazines would be sent to the wrong address.  In November, I asked my son if he'd like to have these magazines renewed and he said he had never received any!  After I spoke with Amazon, my son now gets a message when he goes to his Wish List that his address doesn't match the one in his account, so it's clear Amazon is now aware of this problem.  The publisher will not redo this Communication Arts subscription, saying the magazines were never returned to them, and Amazon has not responded to my request for a refund 
 Overall this book was ok.  Nothing special about it.  I am a cleaning business owner and noticed that the book was flawed.  I would like the author to please show me where a person can get 1 million dollars worth of insurance for $250-$400 as the book states.  Most people can not even get insured for that amount in any state until they have been in business for 3 years.  The author left out a lot of information and I would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about starting a cleaning business.  The only thing decent in the book is the appendix, but even that is not detailed enough.  I give it two stars for effort and because I am a nice person 
 I've been a huge Lewis Black admirer for a long time, spending money on concert tickets, books and dvds, and was excited to receive this dvd.  But now I feel like a complete schmuck. I was horrified at the "gynecologist" sketch. Apparently he thinks that women who go to the gynecologist just sit there in the little rooms completely naked, all juiced up and waiting for somebody to screw. It certainly wasn't comedy, so I guess it was supposed to be soft porn. I was going to send it back and get a refund, but I'm going to destroy it so no one else will have to see it. 
 I found this book a presumtious, hypocritical waste of tree. I found his ideas to be heavily influenced by patriarchal society. This man should not be allowed to quote Tillich but since he did he should have at least done the man justice. His attempt to define the role of sexuality in these instances were meager. See Thomas Moore for an excellent look into sexuality and human relationships. Use this book for a coaster 
 I agree with bibliophile. Most of the 'free' things were catalogs. Here's a sampling of the 'free' stuff. L.L Bean Catalogs, pamplets on raising puppies and kittens from Purina, a free copy of 'Sheer Facts About Hoisery', a Lane Bryant catalog, Lilian Vernon and Harriet Carter catalogs, a free photo or greeting from the president. And the list goes on and on. What do these things have to to with seniors? There are about 100 pages in the back where they talk about free prescription programs and some State sponsored programs for seniors. That might be the only redeeming thing in this book. I returned it to Amazon. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow zero 
 They chosen Robin Williams to be in a Disney movie and this movie turned out to be very corny. Special effects are dull though. If I were a kid I would probably like this movie but now that I'm 15 I think it's stupid. I think I saw it in theater when I was 8 and I don't remember much of it but I think it's not in stores anymore out to buy because people don't really care much about this movie anymore. I don't care about it either. I'm glad this movie is out of stock and it should be. It is very boring! 
 It Might not be A good Album but it definitely shows Shania's potential 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 the whole movie is all 'bout a girl who got assaulted by that witch who swore 2 get her revenge on the girl's father so spirits started slappin' the girl 'n' kickin' her back 'n' forth 'n' pullin' her 'n' pushin' her i feel that was the whole movie all 'bout i was waitin' 4 some other scenes cuz what the spirits did 2 the girl wasn't scary at allllllllll......think 'bout it twice or more be4 buyin' it................ 
 This book, while very well written, is severely lacking in the facts. For those of you who do not believe me, go look at the arguments against Barton's factuality. There are a plethora of sites online that tear down so many of the "facts" that he cites.  A great example of this is Barton's examination of Jefferson's "Wall of Separation." Barton claims the wall of separation is meant to be one-directional in the Myth of Separation. This doesn't make much sense, as Thomas Jefferson was such a secularist with government that he did not think that any portion of Common Law was derived from Christianity. After facts came out refuting this argument, he abandoned it, instead writing new context into the letter to Jefferson from the Danbury Baptists. The idea behind this is to build a different perspective into the exchange. Barton wrote that "the Baptists also expressed to Jefferson their grave concern over the entire concept of the First Amendment." He then made an interesting citation from the Danbury letter:  "Our sentiments are uniformly on the side of religious liberty: that religion is at all times and places a matter between God and individuals, that no man ought to suffer in name, person, or effects on account of his religious opinions, [and] that the legitimate power of civil government extends no further than to punish the man who works ill to his neighbor. But sir, our constitution of government is not specific... [T]herefore what religious privileges we enjoy (as a minor part of the State) we enjoy as favors granted, and not as inalienable rights."  The part he left out have interesting connotations. What was in that one ellipsis read:  "Our ancient charter together with the law made coincident therewith, were adopted as the basis of our government, at the time of our revolution; and such had been our laws and usages, and such still are; that religion is considered as the first object of legislation; and"   This has interesting connotations that Barton purposefully left out. The Danbury letter was written in 1801 - why would the Constitution of the United States be an "ancient charter?" The simple answer is that it is not. The constitution they were referring to was the Connecticut constitution. This is where the question should be asked `why did the Baptists write the letter then?" The answer is that:  "The Baptists' concern was not about free exercise; it was about Connecticut's religious establishment, which taxed Baptists for the maintenance of Congregationalist churches unless they submitted to the "degrading" practice of obtaining exemption certificates which routed their tax money to their own congregations. Baptists were free to worship in the state of Connecticut; their concerns were with establishment and its attendant effects." (Separation between Church and State)  There are numerous websites and scholarly articles that rebuke the works of Barton. My advice, for the careful reader, is to look to people who have a scholarly background for reference material and not someone has been the vice chairman of the Texas Republican Party or who acted as a political advisor to President Bush in his reelection campaign - there is an inherent bias which discredits any intention Barton has of producing facts 
 The Castle in the Attic was about a 10 year old boy named William who lives with his mom and dad in Pennsylvannia.  And he has a baby sitter that stays with him for 13 years and desides to go back to her home in England.  William doesnt want her to go so he takes her picture of her husband who died in the world war 2.  She finds out and is said for him and gives William a go away gift which was a huge toy castle with a led knight 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 I don't see how you can isolate "The Grand Inquisitor" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, The Brothers Karamazov.  I think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the Grand Inquisitor have to say, are ALL important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!!  My suggestion: Buy The Brothers Karamazov instead of this.  It's excellent 
 Even worse than Wing Commander, yet another craptastic movie starring Freddy Prince Junior.  Why does it suck?  Well first it stars FPJ, so you know it's gona suck already.  Next it just sucks.  That's it.  The story is boring.  Hell I don't even remember what it's about.  I saw this movie years ago, and all I remember was that I hated it.    You know a movie sucks when the only thing you remember about it was that you despised it.  Avoid at all costs 
 A bottle of Tarn-X worked so much better and faster.    Just use scratch-free sponges for general cleaning, and when the copper gets dingy a damp cloth of Tarn-X worked in about 10 seconds.  This cleaner kept my elbows greasy for at least 20 minutes a pot.  It DOES work... but be prepared to scrub - at about twice as much as regular copper cleaner works 
 Ive read a lot of business books but this one ranks at the bottom. It wasnt written: it was most probably taped during the authors spare time i.e. commuting in traffic, traveling etc. The book has advice like "attack drugs and alcohol at work...".  Some chapters, like the last, ramble on with no real objective. Ive never returned a book to Amazon but there always a first 
 Like most people, I loved the original Friday - a true classic. I had heard that this one wasn't as good, so I rented a copy just to check it out for myself.  This movie is straight-up garbage. Mike Epps can't carry Chris Tucker's jock. What a waste of what could have been a very good movie series.  Stick with the original; don't waste your time or money on this one 
 Im sorry to say that this carbon filter smells terrible, and the odor does not dissipate. The odor is so bad that it makes me feel sick when I use it.    Cutting this filter is also one big mess, since the black carbon particles fly everywhere when the strip is cut which is one big messy experience.    Honeywell needs to design a carbon filter that does not smell so terrible, and that is already the size you need.  Taking out this long filter and cutting it and making such a mess is a real inconvenience 
 most of these songs were catchy at the time but haven't dated all that well.Rocket 2 u still sounds good.but they got caught up on the sappy side.the grooves were tight.when the Brothers of the group took over vocals  the songs sounded twice as better 
 I had hoped there would be some good ideas in this book. But dutifully reading along produced nothing more than page after page of "this is going to be good, and we're going to start, and it's really going to be good, and we're really going to start, and it's really really going to be good and we're really really going to start..." with pointless "examples" along the way.  Then I realized that if I'm really going to do something with my life, I don't need a book to tell me how. And certainly not this complete waste of time 
 I bought season 1 and you can forget about me buying the next season. I would buy the other seasons but I can't stand the feeling of being ripped off. So sayanora to Big Valley being a part of my collection 
 Sufficient movie to waist a couple hours downtime here in Afghanistan. That's it though 
 The book seems to be more for scoring political points rather than genuine scholarship. The first line in the description says it all - "A book the government of India demands be ritually burned". The BJP led govt. is "demanding" and book to be burned, but "hasn't". While individual members in the BJP govt. are entitled to their own opinion, the govt as a whole hasn't made a policy of banning it. The Allahbad high court (which is totally different than the BJP led govt) has on grounds of hurting public sentiment. Which means this book is banned via the valid legal process.  This book is a publicity stunt and rehash of the work done by other renowned authors/historians previously 
 This is a book your boring granddaddy might have written. That it was (allegedly) written by the monumentally talented James A. Michener is hard to believe. It was written relatively late in his life, and he was losing it 
 I've read both the book and the reviews, and it's funny how saving the children is the "it's not my fault" finger-pointing device du jour.   I don't purport to be a cross-section of America, but I have no problems getting my toddlers out of a grocery store without their Sponge-Bob cereal (my wife is a different story...she loves the stuff) and can drive by a McDonalds while ignoring the shrieks of "we want a happy meal!"     However, I am overweight.   I don't blame Kraft or McDonalds (although I wouldn't mind getting in on that cash cow once the lawsuits hit), I can perfectly well on my own decide to down the entire bag of Oreos without a 30-second ad telling me to.    Mr. Brownell's anecdotal descriptions of the effects of advertising on obesity do not create any link.   As a matter of fact (forget citation of study...but could look it up if anyone wants it) the amount of calories consumed by the average person has increased about 1% over the last 20 years, while the obesity rate has soared.   So...somehow the food industry has been plotting against my children by adding 400% more calories into that 1%?   It doesn't make sense, as do most of the arguments in the book.   
 My father needed a 3.5" drive to recover some old files on floppy disk.   Why did this thing have to cost more than a spindle of DVD-R's?     Because its medium can hold over 1.4MB of data!  That's almost 1/500th as much as a CD-R!!!    Don't get one of these unless you really need to...let the old tech rest in peace 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 I am just so sad to have this wonderful series end so badly.  I do not believe for a minute that Mrs. Braun is still writing these books and whoever is should STOP.  Polly gone, the barn burns and Qwill doesn't seem to care about either.  I will not accept the character of Barbara.  The worst thing of all is that I do not even like Qwill anymore! I will never read another and that is sad to me 
 I simply do not see any point in mixing Crime Fiction with Crime and Punishment.   
 First of all, just to get things off of my chest (and believe you me, I usually LOVE getting everything off of my chest right off the bat!) Item! Jack Canfield is an excellent and gifted motivational writer. Golly, he has motivated me to write a review, right? However, this time around old Jack's soup could use a little salt or herbage to his advice. If you ask anyone where I work, I am always promoting Chicken Soup for the Soul stories however I didn't find these all that courageous or creative. I mean, what is creative or daring about a woman who builds an entire miniature of her office environment in her cubicle using Beanie Babies for each of her coworkers. And what bigger point was Jack trying to point out about the manager who tried to motivate his daily reports by having them act out scenes from "A Room With a View" before they started their shift each day? Kind of lost me this time, Mr Canfield 
 I read this book while in Antarctica last year and had to force myself to finish it.  It became a contest of wills to see if I could red the entire book.  McMurdo is a weird place, no doubt about it.  But somehow, while the author perhaps had the best intentions, it veered off into something that becomes rather incomprehensible.  I spent over seven seasons on the ice and there are so many other stories to tell; the people, scientists, raytheon, projects, science, bureaucracy, idiocy, etc., that would make a great story.  This book is unfortunately not a great story.  Buy another book, any other book.. 
 I agree with the reviewer below who asserts that this item is always on back-order.  After waiting for this item for several weeks already, I was today told by Amazon that there would be an additional one-month delay.  I have canceled my order and ordered these videos directly from Infantastic 
 Communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. This book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. Communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. Some "intellectuals" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). And the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding 
 I am writing as an experienced SWAT operator, firearms instructor, and competitive 3-Gun Match shooter.  This book is great for beginning rifle shooters or members of the Jeff Cooper Fan Club.  However, there is nothing explained or taught in this book that I did not also receive in my very first basic rifle school.  As with most of Mr. Cooper's writing, the text tends to become "preachy" and critical of modern society and technology.  While I usually agree with most of what Mr. Cooper has to say and write, I am not one of his many acolytes.  More to the point, I sincerely wish he would stop writing as if he assumes that the reader is a member of his fan club.  The book was a disappointment. I felt that it was mostly a collection of large photos, stories, Mr. Cooper's opinions on a lot of non-shooting subjects, and a few shooting tips.  Each of the sections could have been expanded a great deal.  At least he didn't push the Scout Rifle concept too hard in this book.  I respect Mr. Cooper and his accomplishments but his claim that "riflecraft is an art that has been completely ignored since WWII" is simply untrue.  There are better books available on this subject 
 I was assigned this book for a class in East Asian-World Politics, so I read it thoroughly and was thoroughly disappointed.  The assumptions that this book is based on are fallacious and misguided, and the authors seem to  have no understanding of either Chinese political culture or the nature of  international relations. To begin with, the book spends most of its time  highlighting and exaggerating sources of tension between the two countries,  and seems to assume that every tension between two states will inevitably  lead to full-scale war.  This assumption is sadly mistaken.  In fact, the  United States and Canada have outstanding disagreements on a number of  issues, yet experience close relations and have the longest unguarded  border in the world. The book relies mostly on provacative statements made  by members of the Chinese Communist Party to support its thesis.  It  ignores the fact that it is common practice in Chinese politics to speak  loudly and negatively about whomever China currently disagrees with.  Just  because a member of the National People's Congress says war with the United  States is inevitable over human rights doesn't mean it will happen.  Have  the authors ever heard Jesse Helms (or many other senators, for that  matter) speak?  Note their reluctance to use force to settle the Taiwan  issue. The entire book comes off as a heavily-biased college paper on  US-Chinese relations.  The fact that they use virtually no primary-source  material or Chinese-language material not already translated adds to this  perception.  It appears that the authors decided the hypothesis of the book  beforehand, and simply searched for information to support their theory.   As flawed and biased a book as I have come across in a long time 
 Poor fit for 80gb...stick on film to protect video face is a joke...it's cheap but save your money on this and buy something better 
 Unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, I think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part.  There are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind.  The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session.  No actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be astounded.  Save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation.  By the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read English very well or are shills for McKinsey 
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 The idiots have struck again!  Ruined a beautiful film by cutting it up to fit a tv screen..are they all insane?!!! If I hadn't opened it, I would return it to amazon now! A flim that was shot in a wide screen format should be shown on the small screen that way. The directors vision has been ruined again by money grubbing fools!  Don't buy it 
 I hoped to kill two birds with one stone with this book as I plan to visit both Savannah and Charleston.  I have only made it to Savannah so far, but found this book very sparse on information.  There was only a very small section on Savannah which contained one lone page of restaurant listings.  There was also only a small piece on Bonaventure Cemetary (two paragraphs), and the book did not include any maps or directions to get you to the cemetary and it is quite off the beaten track!  I would recommend saving your money for real guidebook 
 I am an avid follower of chinese horoscopes and found Lori Reid's book to be very disappointing.  Not much depth to her work at all!  Saying it is concise is being kind.  For the serious reader, I'd recommend the Handbook of Chinese Horoscopes by Theodora Lau 
 great! jus wat hip hop needs, another idiot comin up talkin bout cars n money. its no wonder nas sez hip hop is dead. unless the real mcs stand up soon, hip hop has no hop 
 I bought this book recently and opened it, full of enthusiasm, ready to read. However I found that it's more a pathology than pathophysiology book. It tries to mix the two subjects and as a result it does not cover sufficiently either of the two. It is nicely organized though and may be good for other health sciences, but NOT for medical students! Many of its pictures are "borrowed" from Robbin's Basic Pathology 7th ed. by Kumar, Cotran et al 
 "Another such Triumph and we are ruined." Pyrrhus 279 BCE  Update added 9-7-2006. I am delighted to see that my review has inspired an army of Hutton-devotees to slap together substance-free positive reviews in order to try to counteract my negative review of "Triumph of the Moon" (see below). Prior to my review there had been only two reviews posted in the previous two years - but since my review there has been at least one a month! It's nice to be noticed. Thanks everyone! Now, on to the review itself.  If Pagans are a little vague about exactly how our religion has survived, and a little awkward about exactly how our rites and rituals work, and if we sometimes make up stories to fill in the gaps in our history - maybe there's good reason for that. Maybe our sacred books were burned, and our Priestesses and Priests murdered, and our sacred places desecrated and destroyed. Maybe our Religion has been the target of a sustained campaign to destroy it!  The simple fact is that Religions are very resilient things. They do not die easily. And when they are forced underground they sometimes change in strange and unexpected ways. Does anyone deny that Paganism was forced underground? Many religions have survived under similar circumstances - why must Pagans accept the triumphalist conclusions of our enemies that they succeeded in destroying our Religion? Why can't we just say "we're not dead yet"?  Well, we're not dead. So there. Any person of good will would be sympathetic toward a Religion that has suffered so much persecution - and would be willing to give the benefit of the doubt to those who claim to be its continuators. And a good historian would much more carefully consider the evidence of Pagan survivals found in European intellectual, literary and artistic history, as well as in phenomena such as Alchemy, Qabalah, Magia, Astrology, the Tarot, etc.  Here are some authors to read instead of Hutton: *** Pierre Hadot: Especially his "What Is Ancient Philosophy?" and "The Inner Citade". Hadot is a serious philosopher who knows how to write about Ancient Philosophy for the intelligent non-specialist. These two books offer an excellent introduction to Pagan Philosophy! *** Perez Zagorin's "Ways of Lying: Dissimulation Persecution and Conformity in Early Modern Europe" on the phenomenon of underground Religious movements under Christendom. Also by Zagorin: "How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West" on the violent repression of intellectual and religious freedom under Christendom. *** Julia Annas: "The Morality of Happiness" and "Platonic Ethics Old and New". Whaddya know? The Christians didn't invent morality after all!  *** Michael Gaddis: "There is No Crime For Those Who Have Christ" - sometimes a title says it all. *** Ramsay MacMullen: Especially his "Christianity and Paganism in the Fourth to Eighth Centuries". This is THE book on the question "what happened to Paganism?" *** Pierre Chuvin: "Chronicle of the Last Pagans" - this comes right after MacMullen's book as among the most essential things for Pagans to read about our history. *** Lynn Roller: her "In Search of God the Mother" is a meaty tome covering the three "incarnations", so to speak, of Cybele: in Her native Anatolia, in the Hellenistic World, as lastly as the Roman Magna Mater. Roller also includes a fascinating and devastating critique of the scholarly research on Cybele. *** Antonia Tripolitis: her "Religions of the Hellnistic Roman Age" provides an accessible but also reliable overview of the Religious landscape in prior to the suppression of Paganism.  *** Sarah Iles Johnston: her "Religions of the Ancient World" is a coffee-table book that covers a very broad range of Religious traditions in the mediterranean world prior to the suppression of all other Religions by the Christians. Also by Johnston: "Hekate Soteira" is an essential scholarly reference on Theurgy and the role of the Chaldean Oracles in Late Antiquity. *** Philippe Borgeaud "The Cult of Pan in Ancient Greece". Few aspects of Hutton's book demonstrate his ignorance of Paganism like his dismissal of the God Pan. Hutton ridicules the idea that Pan ever played a significant role in traditional Paganism. Hutton's theory is that Wiccans elevated Pan to a central role solely because of Pan's prominence in contemporary English language "romantic" literature. But of course Pan was a "major player" in Greek and Roman Paganism from the time of the battle of Marathon - as Borgeaud shows in this beautiful little book that every Pagan should read. *** Fraces Yates: Especially her "The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age", "The Rosicrucian Enlightenment" and "Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition".  *** Gregory Shaw: "Theurgy and the Soul: the Neoplatonism of Iamblichus" Neoplatonism was the "last known address" of the classical Paganism of Antiquity - and it is the form in which Paganism begins to resurface during the Renaissance. Any genuine attempt to investigate whether or not Paganism managed to survive would not dismiss philosophical Paganism (and Platonism in particular) as a side issue, as Hutton does, but would make it a primary focus. *** Lucas Siorvanes: his "Proclus: Neo-Platonic Philosophy and Science" is another excellent book on Platonism as a Pagan philosophy in Late Antiquity.  "Triumph of the Moon" is an anti-Pagan book. It has enjoyed a free-ride from Pagans because the vast majority of Pagans have never read a book with footnotes before. After having their brains addled by the works of Scott Cunningham and Silver Ravenwolf, Pagans have eagerly acclaimed Hutton their favorite "scholar". But what is Hutton saying in this book? His main argument can be stated in five words: Paganism is a made-up Religion. If you believe that, then you'll love his book.  Curt Steinmet 
 This is a washed down version of the Superbowls. I am sick to think they are charging this outrageous price for what generally amounts to nothing ne 
 Even with the questionable veracity, I enjoyed Frey's first book, A Million Little Pieces, since it stayed true to an addict's experience.  Leonard, on the other hand, came off as pure fantasy, with very little substance.  Even the description of Frey's struggle was too contrived to be believable.  It was not even interesting as fiction. 
 I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished.  It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.  Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading 
 I can't believe people gave this terrible movie 4 or 5 stars. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is terrible and the story isn't much better. The grainy, shot-on-video look gives it a "Blair Witch Project" feel...but even that couldn't redeem it. Oh, and forget the cover - you don't get any special effects like that in the movie.  As far as plot goes, it involves a group of kids who go to a cabin and open up a game, which essentially brings the ghosts of 3 witches back to kill them one by one if they don't understand and complete the game.  Don't bother with this one - you'll thank me for it later 
 I GIVE UP I LOVE THE DVD BUT CANNOT VIEW AFTER 3 ATTEMPTS THE LAST DISK .. I ALSO HAVE 3 DVDS RANGING FROM GREAT TO JUST OK. SO IT IS NOT MY PLAYERS. I WENT TO ANOTHER STORE AND THE SAME THE LAST OR 4TH DISK DOESNT PLAY SKIPPING ETC . THEY WONT TAKE IT BACK JUST EXCHANGE. I GIVE UP. NEVER TO SEE LAST DIS 
 My computer was running fine until I tried to upgrade.  First it took almost 2 hours to install at the last 3% it found a error and was going to roll back.  Well it never did.  It erased everything.  It went to a dos prompt. Called help line and it took 3 hours to just reload.  When it was done, I had no files or any of my programs on the hard drive.  Not only that but he said I had to install again to register.  It takes forever to install.  Took forever to get in touch with someone, they were in Nova Scotia, and I still do not have a working computer.  I have to try and get a recover program to get my files back.  I recommend staying away from this product for upgrades.  
 I agree with the reviewer from Scottsdale. I revere Sitchin as perhaps the world's preeminent scholar in this field. However, his most recent work seems to be going in circles. We've read it all, and very entusiastically.  However, where are our ancestors today? When will the planet in the 3600  year orbit next be visible? I'd like to see Sitchin's attempts to link  ancient earth mysteries to unsolved modern myserties, such as the earth's  energy grid, the Bermuda Triangle, the "afterlife", psychic  ability, and even a more in-depth discussion of the astrology/astronomy  rift. Mr. Sitchin, if anyone in the world can do this, you alone are  qualified in your most unassuming and appealing manner. It's time to take  your work to the next level 
 When the title of the book says Absolute Beginners's guide it means it.  The book does a good job of explaining the history of robotics, and describing the various types.  But there is a definate lack of explaination when it comes to the robots them selves.  Its simply "asseble part A with part B, then move on to C."  With no reasoning behind why you're doing it.  In short the book does a poor job of teaching you robotics but instead is an exercise in how to follow directions 
 I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT!  I WAS GIVEN THE SHAMPOO FOR CHRISTMAS WHICH WHEN WASHING MY HAIR MADE LITTLE TO NO SUDS.  WHEN TRYING TO COMB OUT MY HAIR AFTER SHAMPOOING IT WAS LIKE A BEES NEST AND I COULDN'T POSSIBLY GET A COMB THRU IT.  THATS WHEN I ORDERED THE CONDITIONER WHICH WAS LIKE CAKE BATTER AND COULDN'T GET IT TO COME OUT OF THE CONTAINER WITH REALLY QUEEZING IT WHICH MADE THE LETTERING COME OFF ON TO YOUR HANDS AND I FOUND SOME IN MY HAIR. I SQUEEZE AND BANG UNTIL I FINALLY GET A BIG LUMP COMING OUT.  I HAD WATCHED ALL OF JONATHAN'S REALITY SHOWS WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON CREATING HIS PRODUCTS AND COULDN'T WAIT TO TRY THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL NATURAL. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!  I RECENTLY SAW HIS SHOW BACK TV WHERE SOMEONE CALLS HIM UP AND SAYS THEY TRIED HIS PRODUCT AND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE AND JONATHAN GETS ALL CHOCKED UP.  I WAS SCREAMING AT THE TV I WAS SO UPSET.  THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CHEAP AND CAN'T BELIEVE I CAN'T USE SOMETHING I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON.  
 The best thing about this tiresome mess is the stunning cinematography and Scorsese's knowledge of New York personalities. But the film utterly fails to capture the magnetism of boxing in its heyday, or provide a fascinating insight into a driven contender from the streets.  From the all-too-obvious movie references to the overweening sentimentality, Scorsese tries to make an Elia Kazan-esque masterpiece and fails miserably. DeNiro's performance as LaMotta is a lot of what we would see from him in later years --monomaniacal mumbling, zero charisma; an almost self-congratulatory exercise in the excesses of dramaturgy.  Who was Jake La Motta? Why was he this way? What was his background? What did he hope to achieve? On the Criterion Laserdisc of this film, La Motta himself in three minutes gives more insight into these things than Scorsese and Schrader's drama does in over two hours. To me, that's BAD filmaking.  I have heard from film snobs that much of Raging Bull's fascination lies in the significance it holds in the oevre of Scorsese. He had just failed miserably with New York, New York and this was almost a religious purging of his soul. I suppose if you want to read into it, be my guest. I consider that self-absorption. I have also heard the patronizing "it's funny" angle regarding LaMotta. I do not think this was Scorsese's intention and I do not find the serious issue of spousal abuse very funny 
 mine blew up the batteries, what a mess. called eton, they said never heard of this happening. took it back for a refund. now i hear a recall is in place 
 I bought 3 of these and I threw them all away.  Your coffee will stay hotter in a thermos than on this warmer.  I think a light bulb would do a better job!  I wrote to Mr Coffee several times and never even had the courtesy of a reply 
 If you are thinking in buying this book, it's probably that you already know some actionscript.  Well, in this book, there is nothing that you cant imagine yourself. Plus there is nothing about oop, and please think.. what kind of game can you make without oop?. I think this book is a joke 
 I had never read the Scarlet Pimpernel, nor seen any of the films. One day when I didn't have time to finish a chapter, I thought I'd start the Introduction. I was enjoying the mystery-style nature of the story, then, in the first three sentences of the introduction they tell you who the Scarlet Pimpernel is! I have quit reading the book because of this. I plan to start again, in hopes that their spoiler was not far off anyway, but it was a terrible let down - on par with when my sister gave away they end of "The Sixth Sense" - which I could not enjoy, knowing what the big secret was. If you get this edition - or any edition, just in case - don't read the introduction 
 What a terrible disappointment this book was -- it's ALL in the How to Cook Everything cookbook that came out a couple of years ago.  You are best to get the larger book and pass this one up.  Mine is coming back to Amazon 
 I tried as hard as I could but just could not get into this book.  Not quite as bad as her book, "Impossible," but close.  Danielle Steel is getting so repetitive in her writing.  Basically, this book repeated over and over how much Quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he didn't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying/dead.  Drivel.  She could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves, but no.  A waste of time.  Very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all.  Disappointing, to say the least.  
 I used this text for pre-med biology course-- I was simulataneously taking Biochemistry as well, but more on that later.  The text, while not overwhemingly as detailed as other reviewers write, was all in all okay, but fell short in many areas.  One of them is the distinct typographical and grammatical errors that riddled, what seemed, to be the only chapters we covered.  There were many sentences that were run-ons, which disrupted the learning and flow of the text (and, in my opinion, a textbook backed by such a major publisher as this, errors like that are out of the question).  Sometimes, for instance in the TCA chapter, I felt that the material presented on Oxidative Phosphorylation seemed out of order, and just a bit too condensed.  The photosynthesis chapter was utterly horrible.  The exercises at the end were poorly written, and seemed to ask esoteric questions about common topics.  The answers to these questions were esoteric still.  I felt that the only saving grace about this were the wonderful pictures: I liked how each chapter opened up an exhaustive diagram.  Other than that, this is book pretty much only a decent cell bio book, but no biochemistry one 
   I was hoping to be able to set up the LCC with this book, but apparently I needed to get the "How to Form an LLC" book (which I'm NOT going to do).    I've read the Nolo California Corporations book and it already covered much of the info here.  What I was looking for was help with writing good articles of organization and operating agreement (specifically for a 1-person LLC).   The operating agreement example he gives is not specific to a one-person firm.  A prudent person might change the language in his example operating agreement to reflect that the LLC is composed of just one person.  Also, the book does not cover the fact that in CA you can specify additional info in the Articles, such as rules for admitting new members.  Awfully light for "All you need to know" 
 She does have an interesting theory that every man is either a "seeing" "Feeling" or "hearing" man and depending on which they are is how you communicate with them. Since I have not applied her methods I am not going to say it doesn't work, but "Make up, Don't Break up" makes much more sense in understanding men & being able to get closer to them 
 "...Allosaurus liked to hunt,and when it caught its quarry,it tore it open,back and front,and never said," I'm sorry!" Allosaurus liked to eat,and using teeth and talons,it stuffed itself with tons of meat,and  guzzled blood by gallons." If you think your child does not see enough  violence on TV then you should buy this book 
 Writer's Digest puts out a lot of great resources for writers. The magazine ain't one of them, however.  For starters about half of the magazine is ads - mostly for other Writer's Digest products. One you get past paying $19.95 a year for what's essentially a brochure, you'll notice that most of the articles don't apply to you. Most writers stick to one genre, yet the magazine focuses on all aspects of writing - fiction, poetry, business writing, editing, non-fiction, etc. If you're working on a biography of J. Edgar Hoover, do you need to look at an article on poetry in the stlye of ee cummings? I'll take "no" for $600, Alex.  So, now you're down to about 10 pages that might be relevant. Well, let's start chipping away at that:  The letters about grammar questions are a waste: if you have a question about affect versus effect, would you write to a magazine and wait a month or two or would you pick up your style guide and have an answer in less time than it took for you to read this sentence? Thought so. (Furthermore the idea that someone would write to a magazine with a question like that is so incredulous one has to wonder if the questions aren't just submitted by staff members in an attempt to fill space, like I used to do when I was the news editor at my college paper.)  Writer's Digest does review software and other technology that might be useful to writers. My favorite was when it reviewed Microsoft Word. Thanks - I'm sure most readers had no idea about the monopolistic word-processing program. To be fair, some of the reviews are useful, although you can get better information just by looking up the product on Amazon.com and reading the reviews there.   If you're going to Writer's Digest for market information, you'd be better served elsewhere: the annual Writer's Market publication has all the markets and is more thorough, whilst the Writer's Market website has all that information and is up-to-date. Your money would be better spent on those two products.  About the only articles I have found useful are the profiles on authors and how they have succeeded. There you have it: two or three pages an issue that are useful.  If you're trying to get your work published, Writer's Digest has several other products that are a better investment than its magazine: go with the annual Writer's Market book, the website, and pick up a style manual of your choosing (Chicago is the best). Don't waste your money on this magazine 
 After watching this movie I wish an asteroid would hit Earth, or the movie studio that put it out.  And what a lame 4th of July scene.  I hope the movie extras in that scene didn't get paid, especially the putz in the white t-shirt.   Geeeesh what a waste of video tape.  
 I first was a rent STAGE FAN, owning the original cast album and addictly seeing the play.  I then got this soundtrack, which leaves out 3/4 of the good songs.  I mean really: Angel does not even sing contact, and there is NNNOOO song "christmas bells".  Rosario Dawson sucks and should play britney spears, not Mimi.  I gave the original 5 stars and this one. OMG. Mimi should be EDGY not GLITZY. I feel bad that Daphne Rubin Vega had to watch her awesome part be ruined by Rosario Dawson's "valley girl" voice.  As for the original cast, especially Wilson Jermaine, their voices almost matured too much.So in the movie recording, Angel does not sound sweet anymore. If you buy the original cast recording you'll end up marrying the recording and worshipping it.  If you buy this recording it will etiher end up in the garbage or in the fireplace.   If you burn it-LAUGH 
 This started off really well.  Then it took some very fast twists and turns that left me wondering if I wasn't reading a book that was missing some chapters.  This was an interesting idea for a story, but eventually you begin to consider Svir and Cor as the protagonists and Tatja is just an annoyance.  By the end, you are depressed because the characters you've come to care about most (including Anchu) have been killed off and Tatja's future is - well - Grimm.  Too disjointed and too depressing for me.  I only give it two stars.  My favorite Vernor Vinge book so far is A Fire Upon The Deep 
 Director Tim Pope's direction of the film could have been perhaps a bit better, but from a purely visual sense the movie is not without its strong points.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the strength of the story itself.  It would have been better not to have tied Mia Kirshner's "Sarah" character to the that of the first Crow film and the overall strength of the narrative (and especially the dialogue) left much to be desired.  And similar to what i said of Tim Pope's direction, i credit the actors for getting as much mileage and investing as much of themselves in the somewhat weak source material that was the script/screenplay for The Crow: City of Angels 
 I tought that this movie was going to tell you the real secrets of Air Force One, but it only talks about the story of the airplane since Nixon, and then it just tells you that it is cassified everything about it, so not so many details. I didn't like it 
 very disappointing book. From the title, I expected something along the lines of how to adjust your horse's environment and work to get a happier, more natural result.  Instead, the book more or less claims that every  horse is in horrible, terrible human-produced pain, and that the only way  to get rid of this pain is to suscribe to every quack remedy that comes  along 
 I bought these headphones to watch TV while on the treadmill. They don't work at all for that purpose. Interference from the motor causes them to cut-out. They work great when I stop the treadmill 
 That`s Norwegian for "Ooops"....  This is a tiresome "pastiche" in which Dudley Moore has lost the charms from 1981 and is just plain annoying. This happens with drunks in real life as well....  the charms and fun just escapes them when they reach the middleage and still refuses any kind of commitment...  This is a needless sequel. The only reason it was made must have been because the stars filmcareers had come to a halt... It`s like a tiresome homemovie...    Still, Liza Minnelli is a pleasure to see(though there is no depth in her charcter as well)...  They ALL should have known better... 
 I rate the Belkin 6 port hub a zero. I installed exactly as instructed to my G5 tower. Plugged in 3 external hard drives and an iSight camera. Not one device showed up on my desktop and iSight didn't work at all. I tried a different firewire port on the G5 still nothing.   To boot, the port screwed up my hard drive. I couldn't shut down or restart the usual way. When I finally got the G5 restarted my menu bar was missing. It took several shut downs and restarts to make things right.  Don't take a chance with your compute 
 "Fascism, what it is and how to fight it" is presented as a work by Leon Trotsky, but is in fact an assemblage of excerpts from various of Trotsky's writings, collected and ordered by Sara Lobman and printed by the Pathfinder Press.  The original source for each passage is cited in a footnote.  Other footnotes, apparently written by Ms. Lobman to make Trotsky's references more familiar, give historically useful facts such as "The Jacobins were the revolutionary petty-bourgeois forces in the French Revolution of 1789."  As a short introduction to Trotsky's thought, it can serve its purpose provided one is already versed in Marxist rhetoric 
 The first book of Auster's New York trilogy was originally published in 1985, and in 1994 was adapted into this graphic novel. I've never read the original (or any of the other parts of the trilogy), so I can't comment on Karasik and Mazzicchelli's adaptation. However, I can say that since I'm not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature (those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for Auster's story), this really didn't do anything for me at all. The story is basically an exercise in metafiction, and if you like that stuff, great -- I do not. It is dressed up (at least initially) in the mystery genre, but that's just window dressing. (There's a long legacy, especially in France, of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings (for example Alain Robbe-Grillet's two books The Erasers and The Voyeur, or the films of Jean-Pierre Melville.)  The story begins fairly straightforwardly: a reclusive writer of potboiler mysteries named Daniel Quinn lives in New York on his own since the death of his wife and son. A complete stranger calls him and thinks Quinn is a private detective named Paul Auster and begs him to to take his case. (The writer Paul Auster, and his family, shows up for one scene -- it's that kind of book.) Quinn meets with the strange man, who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father, who was seeking to discover the true language of God. The father has been released from jail and Quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report. Everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the old man he's been following, and his clients. He spends several months watching the building and going crazy. Once he realizes they've disappeared, he finds his own life has disappeared as well. Obviously this is all somewhat about identity, but it's more about fun stuff like language, representation, and other tiresome postmodern subjects (as are the other two parts of the trilogy, which involve a man spying on someone, and yet another disappearance).   It has to be said that the artwork does an admirable job of treating the bizarro world Auster has thrust his characters into. The simple, heavy black and white inking is a perfect match to the material, especially when the representations become less literal and more symbolic. However, if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters, this is probably not for you. Fans of Auster may enjoy this, but fans of the graphic novel form are probably going to be much less keen. 
 Like many others I waited patiently for this item to be available.  Once I started putting it together I was disappointed to realize the holes were drilled incorrectly and in would not properly fit together.  Also, if many of you are under the impression that it might match your dolce collection, don't buy this item because it does not.  Also, unlike the dolce collection this items layer of stain peels off very badly 
 i liken this book to fitzgerald's "tender is the night." and that is not a good thing. people of no substance plod through hundreds of dull dull pages. are people really this shallow? this empty? probably. but, my god, do i have to read about them? no. i do not. i simply could not finish this book (and that is rare). i wasted valuble reading time for about 300 pages, then had to admit it just wasn't working. because of all the critical acclaim this book recieved, i was very much looking forward to reading it. what a major disappointment! i am truly puzzled by the positive response this thing gets from so many people. great writing? really? i just did not see much of that here. shouldn't a book have at least one interesting character in it? it seems that dullness is making a comback in critical circles these days. too bad 
 Don't waste your time reading this book.  It provided absolutely zero entertainment.  It really wasn't that funny at all.  Sue Margolis tried to be creative with her story, but it ended up being cheesy, predictable, and too far fetched to be enjoyable.  Her characters had no depth, and she actually brought too many different characters into the story.  Her storyline was all over the place with a slew of players, almost all of them insignificant, and it only made things confusing.  It left me wondering what the whole point of the book was 
 I would possibly recommend this book for children but not for the serious reader or someone who needs information pertaining to African-American scientists and inventors. The book has a very elementary style of writing and few citations of where the information was obtained. I was expecting a book with deep information of African-American history but was disappointed in the juvenile nature of the book 
 Are we living in the end times is just what I expected.  Typical apologetic Christian scare tactics based on irrational fantasies. What should scare you is the nastiness of the previous "Christian" reviewers attitudes toward each other.  A person whom may be interested in the Christian worldview likely would be even more confused and probably put off by these people.  Why should they bother to read Mr. LaHaye's opinions or for that matter the Bible itself, since all these people have read these same books and come to such different interpretations  and conclusions.  If they're looking for love and comfort, why should they want to join a group of people that not only look forward to the world being destroyed and 80 percent of the nice people inhabiting it to be murdered and tortured forever, but also seem to hate people of their own faith?      Christians have such diverse opinions because the fact is that the Bible is hopelessly contradictory, no matter how hard apologists like LaHaye try to twist and destort its words to make it form to their own biases.  By all means, READ the New Testament.  Take your time, don't use study guides that try to tell you what they think it means, keep an open mind and THINK FOR YOURSELF. You will find that there is no question that the people writting the New Testament thought that the "end of the world" was going to happen in thier lifetimes.  Pay attention to Matt. 24 when Jesus says he will be back during that generation, or Matt. 16 where people standing there will not have drawn thier last breath before the second coming occurs.  You don't use terms like "the time is nigh", "the end of all things is at hand" or the first words of Revelations itself " the things which MUST SHORTLY come to pass" if you think it might take a couple of thousand years.  When the Bible says the world is flat, the sky is a solid dome supported by pillars with windows in it for the rain, space is full of water, and that giant human/angels used to inhabit the earth, it is wrong.  When it says that invisible people who live in the sky are going to come and destroy the earth and just about everybody in it, that again is wrong. More importantly, it is not moral or anything close to love, which the religious are always claiming they have so much of.       Don't wait for someone to come do some magic and make all your problems go away. Get off your knees and do it yourself. 
 George Soros, one of the greatest speculators of all time wrote this book which is an ode to govenment and bureaucracy intervention. It seems at first sight that Soros realized that true liberalism (not the liberalism of the left wing in America) was wrong and thus the Estate should intervene to fix the market's problems.  Now you may be asking, How come a guy who made 1 billion dollars in one day thru speculation against the british pound in the 90's is now a critic of the system that let him speculate and get rich?. Well, Soros changed his mind about capitalism when he lost 2 billion dollars during the russian crisis. He tried to convince the World Bank and the IMF to save russian markets like they did in Mexico in 1995, but no help was approved.  So, what's the solution according to Soros? Easy: create new bureaucracy. He wants a Global Fed, Government intervention in the markets and a more robust and strong Estate. If this solution were to be implemented, Soros would be denying to others the opportunities he had to get rich. I think what Soros wants is to prevent others to compete with him perhaps because he is tired of today's competition.  If you are into Mises, Hayek or even Friedman, this book will only be useful to show the clichs that the left wing repeats over and over against capitalism. It doesn't add something new to the debate, just shows us that Soros is a great speculator but a poor economist 
 This book is not what I expected.  It's more of a "workbook" instead of a book to read.  I was thoroughly disappointed 
 Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned 
 My 9 year old has great marks in math, but neither she nor I got much past the first chapter.  The writing is complex and the stories of interest only to those who love number puzzles.  My 13 year old boy was far more interested in this book.  If your child is younger and they aren't fascinated by numerical puzzles, give it a miss 
 This man should have never appeared on Oprah.  He's not an AIDS activist but a slick businessman making a quick buck by fanning the flames of black homophobia.  It is unconsciousable to use HIV as a means to sell books and make money.  I read an issue of the Atlanta Journal Constitution that did an article of JL's luxury home and I wanted to vomit.  Lives, both male and female, are dying and this loser wants the world to know that he's living large?  Who cares?  If you buy this book, it means you're naive, and who can respect you if you're naive 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 I was very disappionted by the clear ommision of dog massacering. This is one to miss with little usful information. I am no wiser on methods to dispose of my neighbours dog. I still only know one way and that is quick and painless! I need more HELP 
 I've read about 80% of the book with the other 20% not having anything to do with what I need Quicken to do (investments).  The book is filled with graphical pictures and the chapters are laid out nicely.....just like the help file.  The book is geared for beginners in COMPUTERS, not Quicken.  I know how to use menus to execute commands.  This book successfully shows beginners how to "click cashflows" or "search".  However, I would think that most who would purchase Quicken would already know the basics.  Also, there is regrettably no information about how to link the tax forms to new items that you've created.  Moreover, there is no information with respect to problems downloading transactions from your institution or credit card.  Currently, I am "correctly" setup to download both from my bank and from my credit card.  My bank sometimes doesn't properly login automatically using auto-update, but does login automatically when I click the Update Now button manually (without providing any additional credentials).  My credit card downloads are strange...they always download the transactions, but most of the transactions show up as either duplicates or triplicates.  This wreaks havoc on the Cash Flows page and there is no information in this book to troubleshoot any of those problems whatsoever.  I've recently read most the help file and cannot find any glaring differences with what is in this book.  The book provides nice pictures, but doesn't EXPLAIN anything...just says "to search, click search" etc.  I've rated it 2 stars because of it's lack of differentiation from the help file and because I blew $25 on a "help file with pictures".  I am disappointed in this book 
 Nicolas Cage was either broke (or whatever) when he made this New Orleans filmed trash. There's no other excuse. He plays a "tortured artist" flinging with the wife of a friend (Judge Reinhold). She is Zandalee (Erika Anderson). Zandalee---what a name. Zandalee loves to----and she likes it as often as possible. You see, she's a "free spirit" and her hubby's a bore. No stretch for Reinhold. But no matter who's naked or how often this is an awful movie. Not even worth the one star. It's so bad I watched it going "oh BROTHER". There is no acting in this movie. Just really bad dialogue spoken by the ones being paid to do so. Marisa Tomeii is somewhere in this mess too. But who cares. It's all pointless. Directed by someone named Sam Pillsbury 
 Having taught the book for some years and having admired Branagh's talents as well, I was excited to see what he did with the book.  His acting talents are remarkable, again; the sets are exceptional; the liberties taken deplorable.  He ruined it.  Killing Elizabeth to make the monster lady is laughable.  The end of Justine is pointless.  Deniro does not capture the integrity or depth of the monster.  Minimal script that truncates and eviscerates. Horribly disappointed, especially by the maudlin sentimental ending...bathos supreme.  Frankly, disgusted.  Kenneth, what are you doing 
 It's not that the actual story is nonsense but they guy has included so much 'fluff' that you get board waiting on a paragraph with real content.  This book was so frustrating, I really wish I had saved myself the bother of reading it 
 This film has plenty of mindless action, impossible (to the point of laughable) stunts, and a healthy supply of sexual inuendo. It has all of the ingredients of a large scale "jane bond" (times three) but the finished product will still leave you feeling like you just ate some really bad fast food. A pounding headache is also quite normal after a viewing since complete suspension of disbelief is required.  The "camp" level is turned up so high that it doesn't mix well with the seriousness of the violence and action. Or is it the other way around? Something "fun" could have been done with this material, these actors, and the money spent on FX. But instead we're treated to a collection of loud, mind numbing, rediculous stunts all held together by smirks, quips, winks, and a plot as thick as dental floss. It all comes down to a horrible script lacking any true sense of "fun". For those who argue that this film actually lives up to every "simple" thing that it's "supposed to be" - let me refine my review to just one "simple" sentence:  This movie is a big piece of crap for really, really stupid people!  -J 
 I adored Ella Minnow Pea.  It was witty, well-paced, inventive, funny and endearing.  It is rare that a comic novel packs such a serious message.  Ibid., the story of three-legged Jonathan Bleshette, carried solely through "endnotes" because the manuscript was lost in a bathtub, is another self-conscious attempt by Dunn to reinvent the novel.  I would like to think that he succeeded, and indeed about 20 pages into the book I thought he'd succeeded admirably.  Unfortunately, as the book goes on, it seems more and more like a one-note piano.  Bleshette is, again quite consciously, like Zelig (or the uncredited Forrest Gump); he meets numerous famous people in his life, often in unusual ways.  There is a constant theme of the women in his life meeting their end in Boston, until his great love, the prostitute Great Jane, breaks the "Boston curse".  But so what.  Despite his ability as a novelist to invent any source he wants, from transcripts of conversations to the notes Bleshette and the future Rudolph Valentino scribbled for stage names for the latter and a deodorant brand for the former, Dunn fails to make either Bleshette or the other characters come alive.  The last two-thirds of the novel are rather boring, and little comes of the possibilities that the first bits promised.    Great Jane, for instance, seems at first to have possibilities, and although she ends up as Lady Jane, and tries to save prostitutes from that life, we never get to know her much, or see her plying her trade.  The various hangers-on at the deodorant factory have fewer possibilities (the running joke of "she's the one" "no, she's not" is okay but gets tiresome) and Jonathan's relatives seem to come and go without much purpose, the only exception being his father who comes to learn Yiddish after spending his whole life in Arkansas before Jonathan moved him to New York.  But the real problem is the possibilities for Jonathan himself that are not explored in sufficient detail.  You'd think a man with three legs would have a set of interesting encounters with tailors; nope.  Jonathan goes to war; how were his uniforms made?  Can he use three legs as a tripod and hold a machine gun better?  No idea.  Are there rules to sports that can be gotten around if you have three legs (e.g., catching a football in-bounds)?  A possibility not exploited.    The endnote thing is similarly unexploited.  If you read endnotes (and I do) one thing you notice is a lot of vituperativeness toward prior biographers.  Dunn creates the prior biography ("Three Legs, One Heart") but doesn't take it far enough.  Give us a diatribe, Mark, something totally outlandish.  Pick on the guy's commas or something, or a perpetual misspelling with endless "sic's".    I'm glad we have authors like Dunn who experiment with the novel; this one just didn't work.  At the end he notes his admiration for Woody Allen, and one wonders if he's a fan of the later, unfunny films.  This book is a lot like them.  A great premise with too few jokes and not enough character 
 This is an orthodox Catholic novel, written by an orthodox author, published by the very orthodox Ignatius Press. Since I consider myself an orthodox Catholic, I was predisposed to treat this book sympathetically. But I also appreciate good writing and that's what we're critiquing here -- writing, not simply ideas. Structurally, this novel is a mess. It meanders all over the place in totally unnecessary side trips. The dialogue is right out of "Tom Terrific", often delivered by cartoonish characters. O'Brien doesn't seem to have put too much effort into revising and editing this very long novel.  As a result, it lacks the tightness and coherence that his "Plague Journal" demonstrated.  Moreover, one got the sense from "Plague Journal" that O'Brien was writing out of his own personal pain (as the provider for six children).  This gave the book a genuine feel that is lacking in "The Eclipse of the Sun". Look, the 'good guys' have to write as competently as the 'bad guys'. Just because O'Brien is on the right side doesn't by default make this a good book 
 I bought this album because I love Charlie Haden's tone, and was impressed by the inclusion of the very fast playing alto saxist Miguel Zenon and pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba in the credits. But why were they hired? There's hardly any need in the bland arrangements for more than competent amateurs. It certainly needs a singer and a rocket up the band. I am so puzzled by the five star reviews that I went back and switched on the CD. The track I picked at random was nice, but I couldn't face a second, and played a Fall record instead to wake me up. I shall try again, but it seems a bit dreary.  
 This book is absolutely flawed in its arguements.  Schlesinger ignores the context of the times; he ignores basic truths; he is jaded in his outlook.  By all accts., Mr. Schlesinger is a New Deal Democrat who tries to firmly tie in the New Deal Democrats into the Democrats of old.  This is not feasible as the Democrats of old and the New Deal Democrats had differing perspectives and ideals.  He reaches and stretches with the intent of the Democrats in the Age of Jackson, that they were always for the laboring classes, when this is not the case, especially in Southern Democrats who were aristocratic in nature and outlook.  They could not comprehend the plight of the ordinary laborer, as their world view was quite skewed.  Further, divisions that were slowly emerging between Northern and Southern Democrats, primarily over the slavery issue, are discounted and Schlesinger merely goes back to his jaded perspective that the Democrats were the champions of the common people.  Schlesinger imposes his own view of politics and parties on politicians from the Age of Jackson.  There are other works out there that are 100 times better on the Age of Jackson that this work, such as The House Divides: The Age of Jackson and Lincoln, from the War of 1812 to the Civil War edited by Paul Wellman and Lewis Gannett or The Era of Good Feelings and the Age of Jackson, 1816-1841 by Robert Remini.  However, I will give the man credit where it is due, he does his research.  Pity he doesn't know what to do with it 
 this is basically a personal journal. The artist's ruminations about art and life - very dry reading. Rothko often contradicts himself. There are several books available (such as those published by Taschen) which are much more readable and are filled with beautiful illustrations of the artist's work 
 My daughter loves fantasy books and vampires and werewolves in particular. On a trip to Barnes and Noble, she excitedly bought this book. Well I decided to go ahead and read it for myself beforehand, because we enjoy sharing books. I'm really glad I did. It was pretty sexually charged and my daughter is uncomfortable with a lot of that in her reading material. The main character wasn't anyone my daughter would want to hang around. At 16 years old, Vivian was arrogant, vain and sexually permissive, would drink, claim she smoked pot (who knows if she didn't) as an excuse for lying about why she was grounded. Vivian would continually try to get in a situation where she could have sex with her boyfriend. She had a very clear idea that she could exude power through sex and would tease older men at the bar where her mother worked and even teased her boyfriends father. She ends up in the role of Queen of the pack to a 24 year old King with all that entails. At 16, having a sexual relationship with a 24 year old is out of hand. Vivian thinks she killed someone, but chooses to keep this to herself. Morals are thin if they exist at all. Right and wrong doesn't occur to the characters in this book.  The good aspects of Vivian's character just weren't enough to equal out all the other behaviors. She was loyal to her mother, even though her relationship with her was usually strained. She could be loyal to her pack (but usually just when it suited her) and tried to be loyal to her code of the Moon.  As a Mom I get really torn with decisions like this. This book was really well written. A lot of kids her age seem to really love it according to book reviews on Amazon. It won a lot of awards. It was chosen for the Junior Literary Guild selection, which we're members of, so we get the selected books for her age group. So on that hand, I was tempted to let her read it.  On the other hand, the main character in this book isn't someone I would want to come to my house. She's not someone I would want my daughter to be friends with. She emulates behavior that isn't acceptable for us. Books are friends. And this isn't a good friend for my daughter.  I worry about all the kids her age that read this book and think Vivian is wonderful! I read the reviews on Amazon and Barnes and Noble and these girls think Vivian is fantastic because she's so powerful! She can get away with anything. She can party. She can have sex. She can be a Wolf Queen and live with no consequences. Kids in reviews say they love this book because it's about cliques in school and all kids have to deal with that. Um. No. School is mentioned when she meets her boyfriend and she does have to deal with his friends later on, but I wouldn't say this book is a great relationship tool for helping your kids deal with social issues.  If I wasn't reading this book with my daughter in mind, I could have enjoyed it more. But I find it disturbing to read about a 16 year old and her permiscuity not only with boys her own age, but men much older. I hate to focus on that, but the book does, so I have to. Not all kids in this age group are ready for books with this subject matter. Mine is embarassed to read about it, and was glad I let her know before she cracked the cover 
 I had to throw out almost all of these raisins because they contained crawly things and/or what looks like the droppings of crawly things. I must say I generally love Newman's products, and I was willing to give these raisins the benefit of the doubt. With natural products, sometimes bugs get in them. That's part of the territory with organic matter. But I found white grubs and little brown dots that weren't a part of the raisins in box after shrink-wrapped box. Some boxes were fine, and I ate the raisins in them, but the majority were tainted. I'll need to be assured there's been an improvement in quality control before I try Newman's snack-pack organic raisins again 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. I thought "finally, a book on communication between couples from a male perspective." I was expecting a sympathetic account of the communication between the sexes but such an account was missing in this book.  This book is s not meant for any man born after about 1960. The gender stereotypes are still very strong (both male and female).  The book starts with some helpful suggestions (don't criticise too often, set a time aside to share criticism) but then quickly deterriorates into a rant about how men have not been treated fairly in the media. Topics covered included abuse within the family (men are abused too) and male-bashing in greeting cards. One important missing topic from this list is the villification of men as pedofiles-- especially men who enjoy working with children.   Of course men can be abused by their wifes, and father's by their children but it does not mean that male on female violence is "okay". Rather than making the non-sensical argument that "we hurt too, so your hurt is fine," the author should condemn abuse in all it's forms. Similarly making fun of men just because they are men, is as okay as making fun of women just because they are women.   I have also wondered why there are very few programs for male perpetrators of violence. Most resources are for women, and the way to solve family abuse, is for the woman to leave. Where are the centres to help men communicate non-violently? Why can't the family try and heal together? In the first part of the book, the author identifies that female "fear" is often translated into male "aggression"-- good point, but why is this point not carried onto the discussion of abuse?  Then there is a list of traditional "unnoticed" male work, including being an unpaid bodyguard "in public places (who plays bodyguard when nightfall turns a beautiful park into a dangerous park", just as well a woman can be an "unpaid massager" for rubbing her husband's shoulders. Most of the other "male work" is incredibly gender specific and even a quick read makes it clear that these are special events (putting up the Christmas lights) rather than day-to-day toil. I found this list offensive. We both cook dinners, use the barbaque and put up the Christmas lights.  There is also the male role of "option generating"-- man asks where they should go for dinner, woman says "anywhere", man says "italian?" etc. Apparently "option-generating often involves having one's ideas rejected, which can be emotionally taxing." The beauty of being in a couple is that both parties can create options and both can reject. It's called communication and making choices together.  More than that, I find it offensive that the author glosses over all the important work men do in families. Men now do change diapers, take pride in being fathers, cook, clean and are partners also in the home. How has this development passed the author by? By enforcing the gender stereotype of "the man brings in the bacon", the author is also glossing over all the men, who might like to stay at home with their children... or who would like to work part-time to have more family time. As well as of course all the women, who might like to have a career.  Many of these choices should be made in the family. Gender stereotypes are truly just as damaging to men, especially because they limit the choices that can be considered "acceptable". Why can a man not enjoy spending time with his children? Why does he need to be able to support the family? Should the responsibility not be shared? Where are the men, who are single parents? Male kindergarten teachers? Heaven forbid.  One more irritating passage: "We often think that when a man insults another man by calling him a 'girl', the insult reflects a contempt for women. No. It reflects a contempt for any man who is unwilling to make himself strong enough to protect someone as precious as a woman." hmmm. yeah... hmmm. This is where I started to laugh out loud. Too ridiculous for words.  In short: this book is not for anyone, who is trying to be a father in this century. Rather than solving anything, this book just perpetuates detrimental and dangerous gender stereotypes. Perhaps the author lives in this kind of a world (and indeed much of the material seems to stem from his personal experiences), but I don't know any young man who would... Rather young men now are facing the same challenges of work-life balance as young women are.  It's time to get beyond male-hating and female-hating, juxtaposing male needs and female needs to find somekind of a inherent conflict, and to understand that men and women can live together. And that in a family, men and women have the same goal-- of making their families as happy as they can. 
 PLEASE NOTE: I am reviewing this recording as an *audiophile* and as someone immersed in *historically informed performance*. If either or both of these things puts you in a decidedly different aesthetic camp from mine, then *disregard* the rating I have given it. I do not mean to offend those who love this recording.  I will not argue with those who think this is "magnificent" or "passionate," but I think it is misleading, and even a disservice to people browsing for a recording of this symphony, to call this "essential" and "indispensable" (Amazon) or "the 9th to own" (below). It is a remarkable recording, but I think it would be a shame if someone knew this symphony only or primarily from this recording.  As everyone mentions, this was an historic occasion: the reopening of the Bayreuth Festival, and for some a symbol of Germany's cultural rebirth after the war. It was the last time Furtwängler was at Bayreuth. If one contemplates these things while listening to this recording, it is indeed easy to be swept up by it. I respectfully suggest that knowledge of its context has prompted some to attribute to it a sort of mystical greatness that it really does not possess.  EMI has done what seems like a very respectable job remastering this recording, and it probably sounds as good as it ever will. The peculiar acoustic properties of the Bayreuth Festspielhaus and orchestra pit also give it an interesting character. But this is a live, mono recording from 1951. What makes it special is the sensation of "listening back in time." The recorded sound itself, jumbled and indistinct, cannot even be compared to what can be achieved with modern recording techniques.  As for the performance, Furtwängler may be considered by many to be without peer for his insight into this music, but this is simply not my Beethoven; nor, I believe, is it Beethoven's Beethoven. Furtwängler's "insight" borders on unlistenable in the third movement: 19'32". For me, this kills the performance all on its own. Parts of it actually sound as though they are being played in "slow motion," and sometimes it seems that Furtwängler has slipped into his own private meditation and forgotten he is leading a performance. The cringe-inducing brass section, however heartfelt their efforts, does not help matters.  Collectors and those with an historical interest in the political, social and artistic events surrounding this recording will want to own it, but I think this would be a poor choice for one's first or only recording, legendary though it is.  I highly recommend John Eliot Gardiner's version on Archiv for an articulate, driven, and, in its own way, every bit as passionate alternative to lumbering late Romantic interpretations 
 I had a Technics 111 changer, but needed to get one that held more CDs.  I read reviews on this one (Pioneer), and despite many that said the sound was awful, I figured I have an awesome (expensive) tuner so I should be okay.  WRONG!!!  I have to crank it full blast to even hear this thing; even then the quality of sound is poor - like a child's toy!  Pioneer itself even says to make a changer which features storage of mega CDs something must be sacrificed.  In this case, it is definitely the sound! I'm so glad I still have my Technics (I wish they still made them!) which I have kept using instead of this thing.  Still needing more, I just puchased a JVC.  The JVC is MUCH better, sounds great! When I tested the JVC, I turned my tuner medium loud - the tone was great, clear ... then I played the same discs in the Pioneer and at the same level of volume, I heard absolutely NOTHING on the Pioneer.  BIG, BIG difference!  If you just want to STORE your CDs, buy the Pioneer, but if you want to LISTEN to your music, don't waste your money on this thing!! P.S.  I have an almost new 301 Pioneer if you're interested . .  
 Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson (1854) is a short, episodic novel which continuously promises to flower into a small work of genius but never succeeds. Densely packed with socially explosive themes and literary devices--including two apparent sets of twins, switched identities, transvestite episodes, an emotionally biased stepparent, a scheming heir, a dramatic court room scene, and a mysterious murder--the book is too obviously calculated throughout, and thus, despite moments of genuine power, reads like the awkward concoction that it is. Since Pudd'nhead Wilson is essentially plot-driven, Twain's frequent apparent lack of confidence in his narrative doubly dilutes the novel's forward momentum, leaving the reader uncomfortably aware of the author's somewhat forced creative decisions. Even locally misunderstood lawyer Pudd'nhead Wilson himself--a secondary character--never really exists as a three dimensional figure and seems present throughout only to serve as a deus ex machina at the story's conclusion.   All of which is a shame, since Pudd'nhead Wilson, in terms of its themes, had the potential to be Twain's greatest work.  The novel is the story of Roxana, a slave who, being "only one-sixteenth black," can pass for white and who switches her own light-skinned child with the child of her master while both are in infancy, thus hoping to spare him the horrible fate of "being sold down the river." But Roxana's child, now known as "Tom" and raised as the future lord of the manor, becomes a bully, an ingrate, and a secret criminal, while the real heir, raised without any advantages as a slave and called "Chambre," merely fulfills his role as an illiterate piece of property.   The novel's most significant problem is also its most obvious one. Pudd'nhead Wilson would have been far more compelling had Twain not allowed the text to take the overt position that blacks raised as whites will turn out to be as shiftless, loafing, and inherently worthless as the prejudices of the era defined them to be. This is especially true since "Chambre," the genuine white heir, remains offstage for most of the novel and thus his lack of development as a human being under the slave system is never explored.   Nothing hammers Twain's error of judgement home as much as the fact that the initially sympathetic Roxana develops into a morally compromised individual as the story proceeds, not because it is essentially believable for her to become so, but because Twain needs her to falter to further his rather cumbersome plot. Ultimately, that Roxana is only "only one-sixteenth black" and "Tom" "thirty-one parts white" and both thus essentially caucasian, is neither here nor there, since Twain repeatedly reinforces the notions of the era that both remain "negroes" regardless.   Though only 120 pages long, the meandering Pudd'nhead Wilson reads like a book twice that length, and, as its audience will begin to suspect as the narrative progresses, the story's climax is pat and predictable. Twain might have succeeded at leaving his racially charged themes deliciously ambiguous and prismatic, but simply does not. Few things are sadder than a work of art that attempts to be clever and fails to be, of Pudd'nhead Wilson is an fine example.     
 I hated this movie, it was so boring, I hated his love interest she was too "quirky", this is a poorly written mass of bad jokes, idiotic parents and it was supposed to be in the 70's? I couldnt tell. Dustin Hoffman hasnt been in a good film since the 80's, and he is starting to look like a woman. Susan Sarandon, she is just worn out and obviously cant get any big named roles either. 
 I'd just like to know, what are the people smoking that think this toy is realistic?  I'll admit, I've gotten tons of fun from it... becuase it's just so odd. The noises are weird and the movements are oh-so-70s- mechanical-robot.   Go buy your kid a book. 
 When I read the list of authors parodied, I couldn't wait to dive into this book. I've read a majority of the originals and always enjoy a good parody.  Unfortunately, this book wasn't it.  Sometimes there's a fine line between funny and stupid - but this book never gets close to that line; it stays well over on the stupid side.  Miller did manage to capture the style of the originals, but the attempts at parodies were senseless and void of humor.  Don't waste your money; don't waste your time.  If you're faced with getting a root canal or reading this book, go to the dentist; you'll enjoy it more 
 Bishop Spong is very interesting, instead of attacking conservatives he attacks Christ Himself.  The sad thing is for all the good points he has unless you reimagine faith (or lack of faith) like him, you can easily discount his ideas and some of the true things he says.  He is an important figure, not because of his scholarship which is laughable... he is important because he does prompt discussion and challenges the complacent. 
 As a former park concession employee, I rolled my eyes virtually every time I turned the pages of this book (and yes, I turned them and kept going-- kept hoping things would get more logical).  Concession employees with huge boxes of makeup don't make best friends with NPS backcountry rangers.  Concession employees don't even act like the NPS exists, and vice versa.  Climbers wouldn't put up with Californians driving off-road in their SUVs (can anyone say let-the-air-out-of-their-tires-- or better, piton-in-the-sidewall?)  And as awful as the assistant superintendent is, Yosemite is famous for its gung-ho law enforcement folks who would be all over a quadruple disappearance-- I can't see even a drunkard law dog ignoring Anna's repeated pleas for help.    Lastly, Nevada based the crux of the mystery on a well-known actual incident, just as she did her mystery in Glacier.  Seems a little convenient to me-- where's the creativity in that?    Having said all that, the thing that rang absolutely true was the pecking order of the NPS and the concessioner, in which a waitress would seem slightly less-than-human by "real" park rangers.  Not fair, but that is how it is, and this is why I keep reading Nevada's stuff (and giggling)-- even with its flaws.  
 I'm sure that the author meant well by writing this book; her tone is very serious and sincere.  But it is over-written and heavy-handed.  If it had been penned by anyone other than a celebrity's mother, it would not have been published.  It does not warrant reading and certainly does not warrant buying 
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 The book certainly had occasional interesting points. The author does know his history. The story could have been told in 400 pages. 
 I bought this book hoping to find new and exciting meals and snacks for children. Unfortunately i was very disappointed as most of the recipes are what i call "common sense" and things that i already do make for the my children.  I did however enjoy reading what the kids in the book had to say about the recipes 
 I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.  I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.  There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board 
 I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is missing from this melodic yet rather dull collection of songs 
 The clock itself works well. It did take till sometime during the middle of the night for the atomic time to connect (we set a backup alarm the first night). The idea of utilizing atomic time for an alarm is a fantastic idea, but why would Scott put such a lousy tuner in an atomic clock radio?  Doesn't make sense to me.  Granted, I live in a rural area, but I am able to receive both AM and FM stations from as far away as Fresno, some 50 miles away, on other radios in the house (including a small portable, battery-operated one), and we do have a local FM station.  The tuner is so sensitive that I had to use both hands to steady the dial when trying to tune in a station.  I am unable to receive one static-free AM station, and I eventually, very gingerly, dialed in two fairly clear FM stations (one Spanish-speaking from Fresno, one local), but neither stay tuned in overnight..by morning when the alarm goes off, nothing but static.  A strange thing though...once, while trying to locate a station, I received a fairly clear one from SALT LAKE CITY....wow!  I plan to return the product 
 how many modern day jaws rip-offs do there need to be. Well! Okay this film i would rank lower than 2 stars if it wasn't for the fat that i liked sharks and i want to be a marine biologist. The other reason was i think Casper Van Dien is good actor with a good career ahead of him. But this movie stunk. In no ways does it compare to jaws nor even Deep Blue Sea. I hated almost every moment of it. If you want to see a good shark movie rent or buy Deep Blue Sea. Or better yet just stick to jaws its still the best after all these years. Don't be fooled this is a waste of time and effort. This film needs some coupe de grace some spice but it gets none. ... 
 Basically what you are asked to do in this book is generate dozens of lists on your own and that this process will somehow create an epiphany of your ideal career.  In the beginning, I forced myself to be open-minded about this process, but found that writing interminable lists, which did nothing to clarify what was already floating in my head, did not lead to a career decision. I suppose that this process is supposed to spark ideas and new insights - it didn't. All the stuff that I wrote down was information I already knew quite intuitively and seemed obvious (e.g., I want a job where I get along with co-workers). What I needed was something structured and concrete that would point me to certain careers, which this book really doesn't do.  
 An unreadable book.  Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.    I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it.  Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  Not in this case.  Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read. It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last 
 A Dickens Christmas story is meant to be read in front of the fire with children gathered 'round. As configured in this particular ebook format you cannot do anything but sit in front of your screen and read ninety pages of nineteenth century prose. Not useful at all! This ebook would be far more usefull if, for example, you could copy or print it onto holiday paper. Since this story is in the public domain, blocking those options in this ebook is silly 
 Unfortunately, despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway, I have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards.  It was not sturdy at all, returned it 
 This is a good book for beginners to get some overall concepts formulated of what things are possible on the  web and some good clues as to how to acheive that end. No real tutorials offered and you should have other texts or the web to glean that info.. 
 I eagerly awaited this Cd/book set but was disappointed in what it actually delivered about its subject matter.  The companion book text was beautifully rendered but it was almost entirely a compilation of informational "bits" from other sources, that might be inspiring for the beginner but are pretty unsubstantial if you are looking for technique. Good for beginners but the serious practitioner will need more.  Russill Paul's works are far more informative and his Sanskrit pronunciations (pronunciation being VERY important when healing with sound) are correct 
 This may only be my opinion, but I've gone to therapy in the past so I feel I can compare this book with what would be discussed in a professional office.  The info in this book is not new or innovative.  It sheds no new light on the situation.  It may give insight to someone who has never read a book about anxiety/depression before or is suffering a mild depression not requiring any professional intervention.  I would recommend it to someone who has mild ephisodes of anxiety.    Unfortunately I could not relate to Lucinda's experiences of riding on a plane or giving a dinner party.  I believe if you are suffering a depression or anxiety and it is more serious than the two examples above, her advice is much to general to help at all 
 I purchased this book before it even hit the shelves because of how easy the preparation of the meals was supposed to be. The day before I was induced with my second child, I spent 3 and a half hours at the grocery store (with my 16 month old) trying to find all of the ingredients necessary for the plan. Over $300 later, I thought I had everything. Not so! On the very first day there were items on the menu that were not part of the shopping list. And meal preparation?! Not as easy as described for a new mom with a newborn. I needed a personal chef to get everything done for me. No wonder celebrities rave about this plan...they have money and chefs 
 I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie.  Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language!  A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard 
 This book is very limited in its helpfulness.  The title is very misleading, because Minot only knows what he's talking about in one of them.  He should not even have attempted to touch drama.  I wonder if he's ever even seen a play, as his attempts to instruct are completely off.  Minot also focuses heavily on "don't do" lists rather than the instruction of helpful insight.  In three words:  the book blows 
 I'd have to wonder how many trees were cut down to write this dribble?  On the other hand, in case it gets cold out there and I run out of logs...it could be useful.  But if George Bush had the (D) after his name instead of (R), the same people who hate him would be wanting to have his baby 
 The large size and multiple settings were great.  But product stopped working after just a couple of months 
 The first two or three tracks are good but the supporting instrumentals and vocals are poor.  The supporting instrumental on track 6 was so bad I thought the cd had a defect.  In other places, the supporting music is  barely audible.  The only singing occurs on track 12.  I would recommend  getting the cd "Picture This".  It's much better 
 this boat seemed like a great idea, and my 7 month baby does like it. it gets him in the water, which is fun, but i cant even take my eyes off him for one nano-second. he has fallen over the sides, he has fallen forward between the seat and tube. the seat is so small and there is so much space between it and the tube. my babys legs fit fine in the leg opening. this boat is dangerous. i am looking for a new one 
 there's plenty of other reviews that have already commented on the copy protection. i just wanted to point out that i'm another lost sale. as a linux user, the copy-protection really wasn't going to stop anything, but it's the principle of the matter.  big kottke fan, big mike fan, big "clone" fan. sorry guys. maybe one day there will be a real cd i can buy. i'm disappointed 
 I'd give it 0 starts if that was an option!  A total piece of crap! Try cleaning it, and the head falls apart! Try putting it back together, and plan on doing nothing else for a LONG TIME! DO NOT buy this razor 
 This book is just dull. There's nothing in here a parent wouldn't naturally think of on their own to coax a laugh out of their baby. It's completely devoid of any imaginative or creative content. Heck, I don't think the little tricks in here even WORK. Skip this one for sure 
 I haven't read the book but the 6 hour audiobook was fairly slow for what could have been much more interesting considering the subject matter.  It seemed like the author really has an axe to grind against the CIA.  The stories seemed overly focused on any mistakes the CIA made.  The author lost credibility with me when he said he was the one who revealed the presence of the secret nuclear bunker that was to be used by the US Congress in the instance of a nuclear strike. 
 To begin with the movie Tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.This movie is produced in New York. The protagonist is Michael Dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.The situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman.For the reason that he cannot continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed  by that time. So there is where Dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous. He gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman.In addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera. Thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing. He has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he didn't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.The characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.THe way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear  women's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent. Because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work. The stes in the movie are really well done and I like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.The lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated. The costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok.Furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting, there were not that much music but it was ok. This movie could be reall in life because  sometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job. I will really recommend this movie to my audience because itis interesting to see how his man do all that work with enthusiam and it really leave us a message of life. 
 A friend recommended this book to me, so I picked it up.  From the start, I had to force myself to keep going.  I read the whole book, but I wouldn't recommend it 
 I would like to review it. When are you going to send it to me 
 Can you say P A I N? This is what Steve Madden shoes are. Pain. The soles must be made of cast iron. The upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough. I am convinced that this Madden person HATES WOMEN. If it were in my power, I would track down Steve Madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs, Only Standing, Walking and .....Dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain. 
 It's impossible to review or rate this book as it's not available.  Many of my devotional readings reference this book...but sadly I've not read it due to unavailibility.  What can I do to help get this back in print 
 ...are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better. Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they're written on Mandelbrot wouldn't have to write books like this because he'd be cleaning out everyone else's wallets on the stock market. In particular, if it's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn't know anything that countless other traders don't already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street.  But I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot 'on tour' a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as "my work shows that..." or "I demonstrated that..." even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other people's work he'll do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'Everest' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesn't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians.  One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can't be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing!  I think it's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it's not completely valueless. But I found the discussion of multifractal time methods (which make up a large part of the book) to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless. I work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time, but it doesn't mean I have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces. It just means I know how to fool the eye 
 This book is absolutely not worth reading--it's barely readable, has no defined plot, and is an overall disappointment. There is no plot in this book beyond sex scenes and clumsily drawn out character "relationships" which tend to consist of the protagonist realizing that she has to have sex with someone.  I don't recommend this book at all 
 I can't believe TBN has promoted this book. Read the Publisher's Book Description above. It's totally ridiculous.   What are the advantages to loneliness???  Why does God use an enemy to refine you???  How can a handicap or disability offer you the most dazzling reward in heaven???  God gives you thorns for your benefit???  Instead of believing the information in this book, read the negative reviews below and take them into consideration. [... 
 From reading all the previous praise of this book one would get the impression that Aimee Bender is on par with Mother Goose. This praise is gratuitous at best. In every story, Bender consistantly breaks the number one rule of good fiction, the "show, don't tell rule". Here are some excerpts from GIRL IN A FLAMMABLE SKIRT as examples. In fact, I'm going to open the book at random to find examples: (1) from "Legacy": "On the set of her fifth movie, the starlet was sitting at her makeup table feeling inestimably sad. I have beauty and fame and riches and boyfriends she thought, and yet I am so unhappy." (2) from "The Ring": [a girl is saying "yes" to a marraige proposal from a cohort, while they're robbing a house] "And right there in the stranger's kitchen I said yes to that robber and both of our eyes filled with tears at the rightness of it all. Shutting the front door quietly behind us, we walked hand in hand to the car; when he said we were far enough away, I let out a shout of joy."   And these are just two random examples! There are many more.  Bender's prose is so sparse that emotion fails to exist in her stories. Instead, Bender needs to rely on telling the reader what emotions are happening instead of showing them. Unlike Hemingway, Bender's sparse prose doesn't work. There are not enough words to hold up the feelings Bender is trying to get through.  The symbolism Bender uses in many of her stories is interesting, but without craft, the symbolism becomes nothing more than a gimmick. Yes, it's interesting to think of the symbolism and what it all means, but if there is no emotion conveyed through the writing then who cares? The characters are two-dimensional, the plots are weak, and if the stories themselves are held together by only symbolism, then what's the point?  People have praised these stories for their fairy-tale quality and their fantastic imagery. I think the only fantastic thing that has happened here is that Aimee Bender has become so popular. (Just what were all those journal editors thinking?)Bender's picture on page two of the paperback edition is the best thing about this book. Hopefully, this California writer can step it up in her next collection. 
 well I guess I'm the odd one out as I really, really dislike this DVD. I love aerobics. in my search to find an aerobics DVD I bought "Moving Through Menopause" based on the other reviews on this site.   my complaints settle around the aerobics part of this DVD, but that is what I bought it for. the workout starts at a ridiculously fast speed with no actual warm up. the choreography is horrible! it manages to be boring, while at the same time having you jump around like a jackrabbit on crack. several times through the work out, when it's mentioned that a lower level of activity can be followed, the shot pans the woman doing the highest level. the rhythm and enjoyment of motivating yet fluid moves which I look to aerobics for is fairly absent in this workout. the focus on balance during the cool down is interesting and of worth. but that's the only thing I have to praise about the aerobics section of this DVD.   the presentation is flat. a workout DVD may not need to be a fashion show, but there should be some spark. after all, if it's any good the consumer will be doing it hundreds of times during their ownership of it. nothing in this presentation had that kind of spark. the most menopausal thing in this DVD is the women's attire. which may be a small thing, but combined with the rest is worth mentioning.   I gave this DVD a solid try. I've done the aerobics workout several times in the last 6 months and just keep deepening my dislike for it. 
 I purchase this press, and was totally disappointed with this product. It takes longer to press a shirt with this so called press, than with an iron. I will be returning 
 This book is awful.  The blurb makes it sound like a story of ostracism in high school, but the characters are cardboard-flat. It's more of a preachy spiritual trip for the author than a story.  There's no reason for the narrator, Justin, to befriend the school outcast (who is a Christian-raised white boy trying to live as a Buddhist monk). The narrator's friends are bratty and too obviously shallow. The school bully is a stock stereotype who does all the predictable bully things. I got about halfway through and quit. 
 ... which makes the wrench completely useless.  I'll have to buy another wrench elsewhere from a vendor that supplies the bits.  Also, the wooden handles have splinters and are extremely cheaply made.  Do not buy this product 
 I couldn't wait to get this book, but what a disappointment.  Don't expect to get clear instructions because you won't!  The diagrams and instructions are extremely vague, and you will be left up in the air as to how to complete an item, you get one tiny bit of info and you're meant to just know how to finish the thing off.  Not worth the money and if I wasn't so far away I'd return it! 
 This book is great for anyone with a thin knowledge of hip-hop culture.  Boyd drops a lot of names and poses hard but doesn't leave the thoughtful reader with very much by way of hard analysis.  He doesn't even really explain what his thesis is beyond solipsistically refering to a generation's hunger to "get paid."  The fact that NYU Press published this book and sanctioned it as "scholarly" work is a sad commentary on how deeply the ethos of entertainment and racial posturing have permeated contemporary American life.  Boyd will certainly live to regret the title of this book 
 Though well written.  Mr Strobel's 'Case for Christ' cannot be logically concluded since all of his sources come either from the Bible itself, which indirectly Strobel is also making a case for, and people who are unabashedly Christian.  It is like attempting to prove the existence of god by saying that the bible says he exists.  Then when questioned on the validity of the bible we say it is valid because it is the word of god.  Strobel tries to make a case by stating biblical sources when in essence that is the very thing he is trying to make a case for.  Including other secular non-christian sources that provided validity for his claims would have helped his case tremendously.  As it was it didn't prove anything to me other than Mr. Strobel is a believer.  Good for him. 
 Another attempt to issue the definitive edition of the legendary Bluesbreakers album that falls slightly short of the mark. The mono and stereo mixes on disc 1 are excellently done but simply replicate the single disc issue featuring the same material released a few years ago. This, therefore, sheds no new light on this fertile period of the second British blues boom. Disc 2 features some BBC sessions along with the familiar Immediate and Purdah 45's and half a dozen live tracks, in poor sound quality, that have been available before.   This is a big disappointment and is a missed opportunity which could have been avoided if the compilers had made any attempt to research the easily available archive information from this time. John Mayall himself was known to have kept meticulous records of sessions, gigs, personnel and recording dates and I'm sure would have been more than happy to contribute his knowledge in order to preserve his legacy in the best possible manner.   Anyone expecting to hear more of Clapton's stunning guitar work from this time is in for a big disappointment. Many of the songs from the BBC sessions presented here have nothing more than rhythm guitar low in the mix. This is the case with the first three songs on disc 2 and despite the session date given being after the point where Clapton joined the band, I suspect it was actually recorded earlier with Roger Dean on guitar. The three songs from the October 25th session are from the time when Clapton had taken a sabbatical and had been replaced by Geoff Krivit. The third BBC session featured on the disc includes only two songs out of at least five, and possibly six, which are known to have been recorded with Clapton in the band, one of those missing being a rare live version of the instrumental, Hideaway. This session has been bootlegged in excellent sound quality and so it's omission from this set is inexcusable.   All in all the "Deluxe" edition does nothing to enhance the importance and excitement of this classic album and the poor selection of additional material on disc 2 turns what should have been a worthy project into a complete waste of time and money. Five stars for the original album - 1 star for this reissu 
 I was a philosophy major in college and I hated this book.  But then again, the whole NAMBLA fic genre really doesn't do it for me.  I'm sure some literary aesthetes are going to pick this review apart, good for them.  I'm incredibly well-read and thought this one was just a tepid bore.  Save your time, read some Dostoevsky, some Dickens, some Milton, (...) 
 I bought this watch because I wanted an altimeter but needed to return it because of its size. It is HUGE - looked like I had a clock on my wrist. Take into consideration 
 Thankfully I borrowed this one from a friend.  I vowed 4 books ago that I would never buy any of her stuff new - only used or borrowed.  Not that I don't respect her as an author (I keep reading don't I?) it's just that I've had too many disappointments. This book is short.  I read it in a couple hours and was like 'wait, that's it?'  It seemed as though I had read a chapter from one of her other books.  Like other reviewers mentioned - only 1 half axxed zombie raising and 1 sex scene (gosh I miss Jean-Claude).  That's it.  Some moaning and groaning about her insecurities, but that was all folks.  Since you can pick up just about any of her books and not feel lost in the series, I recommend skipping this one.  Unless someone loans it to you to read while waiting for the dentist or in traffic 
 Darkvision by Bruce Cordell is the third in a series of stand alone novels published by Wizards of the Coast. The particular series that this book is part of is the Wizards. Previously, they have released the Rouges, Priests, and Fighters. All books in these series are standalone and you don't need to read anything else before hand to understand the book. The other books in the Wizards series are; Blackstaff by Steven Schend and Bloodwalk by James P. Davis. Thus far the other two books in the Wizards series have been disappointing reads. This one, sadly, is not any different. Darkvision has a lot of potential, yet it fails to follow through and seems to be a book written in the wrong world (I'll explain that later).  As I mentioned above, the plot of this book has great potential - if not a little rehashed. An ancient evil has found a foothold in the world and a couple groups of heroes seek to solve the problem. Is this a rehashed plot, absolutely, by Mr. Cordell lays it out in such a way that it does seem new. However, this book seems written in the wrong world. Some of the things that are present in this book do not belong in the Forgotten Realms, they belong in Eberron if anywhere. Things such as airships, crystal body parts etc. There is a line between adding new things to a book and blatantly crossing the line and adding things that don't belong. I honestly can't believe that WotC allowed this book to be published with all the things that don't belong.  The characters in this book are pretty good. Yet there is one cliché that the author uses not once, but twice to the same effect and that is the age old cliché of putting an old wizened person with a young person and the old person provides the knowledge and `hints' to get the younger person though the tough times. Think Gandalff from Lord of the Rings. One of these type of characters in a book is bad enough, but two it two too many. It quickly becomes repetitive and the reader no longer has to guess who will survive, because it's quite evident how it will end. There are some good characters in this book, but they quickly become loss within the crystal body parts, the sage advice, and at times the disjointed scene transitions.  Overall, this book seems to fit well with the other Wizards series books in that it's just not very good. There is one more Wizards series book scheduled for release in December of 2006 and I can only hope it will be a lone bright spot for this series. The first 50 pages of this book are very good, but then the author seems to lose control of the book and it seems almost as if he tried to include too many `new' things. Some times it's better to keep things simple. In the end this is another below average novel and a disappointing one at that. 
 I watched this on Masterpiece Theater and was intrigued enough with the family story to buy the book.  The characters and the historical context are much better developed in the book and you don't have to listen to that extraordinarily whiny, droning music.  
 Let me start by saying that this is the only Dirk Pitt/Clive Cussler novel I've read so far. I have no opinion on any other DP books. This, however, was dreadful.  This book's only redeeming point is the seemingly interesting theory about the Trojan Oddyssey having taken place in the Atlantic  Ocean instead of the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, this theory has preciously little to do with the rest of the book, and seems to be there mainly as a selling point for a mostly unrelated (and very poor) story.  The actual story is best compared to a bad James Bond movie (one from the seventies would do nicely), complete with super-villains, world-threatening schemes and secret bases. The problem here is that all of this is completely silly from start to finish (what on earth was up with the hologram pirates?). Everything is far-fetched, implausible, or most likely both. It also has none of the style and very little of the humor which often redeems James Bond.   To make matters even worse, this movie must contain the worst characters in living history. From Dirk Pitt to the super-villain, they're all extremely dull and flat. Yet, no opportunity is wasted by the author to rub in how wonderful, beautiful and talented all these characters (supposedly) are. Together with lots of unnecessarily lengthy descriptions of just about everything, this book is truly full of filler.   The characters are also completely super-human, apparently, since there doesn't seem to be anything that Pitt cum suis can't handle, including flying a helicopter into the hurricane of the century (just after the hurricane nearly took out a much more sturdy plane) and much more. This takes away any form of suspension there could have been.   If this book didn't take itself so seriously, it might have worked. As it is, though, "Trojan Odyssey" is a totally daft, horribly written excuse for a book that does almost nothing with a potentially very entertaining theory 
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter . 
 MAY WANT TO PICK UP ON 
 'Advances in Agronomy, Volume 73', left me bewildered. Nowhere in the text did I find reference to the well-researched fact that those who practice agronomy, and who have been convicted of it, are usually recidivists who can never be rehabilitated. So therefore, how has the topic been advanced? Society should be protected from agronomists and their vile deeds. I might sound harsh, but I say that all agronomists should be locked up for life and rendered hormonally inert through the administration of impulse-destroying chemicals. 
 	I read this book on the recommendation of two close friends - both of whom are retired English teachers - and both of whom should have known better.  It is one of the most disappointing books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Although other reviewers have commented on some of the same things, I think the book is so bad they bear repeating. 	The characters are so thinly drawn as to be stick figures.  The ambitious young professional woman, the used-up poet turned to drink, the insecure young wife, and the brother who main functions seem to be the guy who brings the boat and to be the near recipient of a "quickie on the rocks."  Who could possibly care about any of them?  Without anyone to care about, the author has no chance of developing suspense and eliciting an emotional response from her readers.  	Switching back and forth between two stories in alternating chapters can work as a plot device, but its success depends upon the two stories being brought together in some convincing fashion at the end.  This doesn't happen, and as if that's not enough, the present day chapters are further split by references to the 1873 murder scattered throughout them.  Clumsy and distracting are the best things one can say about the plot development. 	Even though this is a novel, its characters should behave within the scope of believable human actions.  Asking your husband when he first met the woman you suspect he may be having an affair with is believable; asking him the question when you're in the midst of trying to save yourself and family members in a violent storm at sea is not.  There are other examples of forced dialogue, but this is among the most outrageous. 	Lastly, subtlety is obviously not Ms. Shreve's long suit.  The androgynously named child, Billie, is the only one to suffer the consequences of everyone else's failings.  Gee, is this really the death of innocence?  It's about as nuanced as the murderer's ax on Smuttynose.  And how about the danger of  humorless puritans in the face of  real or supposed sexual variations?  Who would have thought it?   	So why has the book been as popular as it is?  It appeals to the world view of certain young moderns:  Sex is the driving force behind all human actions, the brooding woman is the most fascinating creature in view, and a civility devoid of human feeling is to be prized.     	The Norwegian characters in the historical murder prompt one last reaction.   In downtown Oslo is the Vigelund Sculpture Park.  It is populated with the large and brooding sculptures of Gustav Vigelund, a local sculptor whose work is appreciated almost nowhere else on earth.  If one spends anytime there, one comes away gloomy, perplexed, and with the certain knowledge that an afternoon has been wasted.  Save yourself the expense of a trip to Norway - read The Weight of Water instead 
 Business continuity planning needs to be tailored to the organization and its needs.  This book does not present a methodology which can be tailored as such.  It, instead, provides boiler plate questionnaires and checklists which limit the user and the organization to the author's interpretation of what an organization needs.  Basic stuff and not particularly useful 
 Bill Adler has taken past interviews, articles, and speeches of Oprah  Winfrey and complied _his list_ of her best quotations. It's an  unauthorized book - meaning Oprah didn't write it nor was she involved in  the production. Some quotations show the source of information with a date  and some don't -- which makes it a bit disappointing not to have the  history or context pertaining to the quote. If you have an extensive Oprah  collection, you'll want this book just to say you have everything,  otherwise there are many other good Oprah biographies available 
 The book sucks, 90 out of a 100 patterns are HIDEOUS, most of them really basic and boaring too. Image files aren't even in layers for editing in photoshop, as advertised. A complete waste of money. 
 Overall the nuts were soft and lacked the flavor we had hoped for.  For the price we could have done better.  
 This book is not very helpful and confusing to use. A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands. 
 This book is nothing but a self-congratulatory epistle for India written by a man with modest writing and intellectual skills.  His constant use of terms like "massive" and "huge" when describing increases in business volumes, his complete lack of significant or comparative statistics and his untamed proclivity for hyperbole leaves the reader both bored and breathless.  The tale brings to mind the threats, twenty years ago, that Japan would "buy the United States and rent it back to us."  That "miracle economy" has been in uninterrupted recession since at least 1990.  This author bases his arguments on "because I say so" reasoning extrapolated from his being Indian himself and any notion that there might just be a little bias in his thinking is squashed by his playing of the Race Card early in the book.  Then, after selecting quotes only from sources supporting his outrageous claims, he feels free to prognosticate about India's future without the need for any verifiable facts to support his thesis.  Most entertaining was his claim that India will emerge as a military power.  India has not put a credible army in the field for a couple thousand years.  Since independence, they have either lost every conflict in which they were a participant (like against China) or fought to a bloody stalemate (like Pakistan).  Perhaps the author longs for the days of the Bengal Lancers but modern conflicts do not typically involve bayonet charges or mounted cavalry actions.  This book has interesting ideas for serious study but it would be foolish to consider this the last word on the future of India as an economic force.  The author dismisses or ignores far too many important issues for that.  Example: what about the near nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan just a few years ago?  If such a confligration were to take place, in what kind of shape would that leave India's infrastructure and economic viability?  It is too real a possibility to be ignored but the author manages to do just that.  What about the AIDS epidemic rampaging through India and the rest of South Asia?  That disease has decimated a generation of leadership in Africa and it has just begun its grisly process in India?  Further, supposing the author's predictions do come to pass...who, then, will be able to purchase all these products and services coming from India?  Not an impoverished and unemployed America, to be sure.  Buy this book just to say you've done it.  It's not worth much more than a casual read 
 Buddhist math? C'mon.  First, let me say that fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are great tools. They're valued parts of the 'soft logic' kit that includes probability, interval arithmetic, Bayesian and Markov networks, and lots of other good stuff. Fuzziness involves many of the formal techniques used in probability and elsewhere, and gives a useful, alternative view of the systems it addresses.  The basic fuzzy idea is that most descriptions involve shades of gray, that few systems really match the black/white, on/off, either/or duality of standard formal logic. That's fine, I can get along with that quite well.   My problem, though, is that Kosko presents the fuzzy world-view vs. the traditional or "scientific" in exactly the black and white terms that he rejects. He also argues that fuzziness describes the world more effectively than "scientific" terms, that the rules of arithmetic, probability, and calculus are just games. They are played for their internal consistency, not because differentiation or factorials occur in nature.  That's true, and as a heavy math user I know enough to distinguish my models from reality. Two facts remain, though. First, the models very often do describe reality in ways that can be checked easily enough: the bridge doesn't fall down and the TV receives its signal. Both happen because the bad old exact arithmetic has some kind of correspondence (no, I don't know what) to the real world, giving real ability to predict real results. Second, fuzzy logic and fuzzy arithmetic are themselves mathematical formalisms, games like all the others. Once you get past the gee-whiz stage, there is mathematical content as rigorous as in any other field of study. It's not either/or, it's very often a different way to interpret the same self-consistent games people have played for years. It adds interesting rules to the game.  The great thing is that you really can use the new interpretations and tools along with the old ones. Fuzziness doesn't demolish the old structures, it bolsters them and adds capacity.   And you can get all these benefits without shrink-wrapped, bite-sized pieces of Eastern philosophy.  //wiredweir 
 I rarely give up on a book but after plodding thru the first third I had to move on to something else.  It sounded interesting and I had high hopes when it was chosen for book club but it just had no life to it.  I couldn't seem to care about any of the women in the story and that goes against everything this book is supposed to be about.  If you must try it, get it from the libary!  
 This book has the noblest of intentions, and I cannot fault either its authors or the women they interviewed for trying to help men understand women better. Unfortunately, a better title for it would be "What Some Women Want Men To Think They Want", because the book's approach to answering its title question is flawed. It assumes that women say what they mean, especially when they are told that their responses will be read by an audience they hope to influence for their own ends. And it assumes that women themselves know just what they want, which few of us, male or female, actually do (when I mentioned this book to a female friend, she asked me to let her know what women wanted when I was through reading it, because she and all her female friends had no idea).  That is not to say that the book is devoid of helpful advice, because there is some good stuff here, particularly that given in the "Can She Ex?lain It" sections. Kate Fillion's contribution, for example, which pointed out the impossible standard women today are called upon to meet, was fascinating and eye-opening. But in general the quality of advice in "What Women Want" varies widely; the emphasis on respect and communication can only help men in marriages or other committed relationships, but the advice on how to meet and court women is useless in the extreme and could well be read as advice for men on how NOT to get a date (though celibate guys can use it to make female friends who will see them as one of the girls).  There is a further flaw that must be mentioned: it is clear that the authors do not understand men, for this book assumes that all men are the same and want the same things. Even as it attempts to convince men of the complexity of women, it ignores the fact that men are no less varied, which diminishes its value for much of its intended audience. The "guy-talk" tone is often irritating, and never helpful.  The greatest value of "What Women Want" does not lie in its advice but in its very failure to accomplish what it set out to do, and with a little digging we can see just why it all went so wrong. There is no doubt but that the women interviewed in this study thought they were answering the questions honestly, just as there is also no doubt that the behavior of women in the real world frequently does not match those answers. Part of the reason for this is, I believe, our society. America is the wealthiest nation in world history, and we are all, men and women alike, told by the mass media that our lives should be perfect and that there is something very wrong with us when they are not. Fantasy, not reality, dominates gender relations in America today, and this leads to unrealistic expectations about the behavior of our partners, even as the fantasy of perfection cripples our ability to communicate (if Leonardo DeCaprio and Jude Law don't have to have intimate talks with their lovers, why should we?). The comments in this book are a prime example: men must be perfect, like the heroes in romance novels (correctly called female porn by the authors), or they will be discarded and ridiculed. Many women, like many men, judge potential partners based on how well they match up to criteria developed in sexual fantasy, not reality, and so real partners will never measure up. And because society tells us daily that the "customer is always right", it makes sense that the women interviewed in "What Women Want" seem to feel that they bear no responsibility for their own happiness, as according to this book it is always men who must compromise, but never women.  Ultimately, then, "What Women Want" is largely a collection of demands and complaints made by members of a culture whose 50% divorce rate makes any comment by its members on gender relations suspect. It is also a very human and American book, because the often unrealistic demands made by women here are mirrored by the equally unrealistic demands so often made by men, and which, with the same sort of interviews, would no doubt come forth just as passionately and be just as pointless 
 I'm perhaps the only Steinbeck lover not to have yet read "Grapes of Wrath" or "East of Eden."  Instead I have focused on "Of Mice and Men" and his lesser known works, such as "To a God Unknown" and, my personal favorite, "Pastures of Heaven."  I've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular.  When I began reading "In Dubious Battle," it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbeck's work.  Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating himself into Mac's radical cell.  There is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar, work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers.  Early on, the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging.  Suddenly, Steinbeck simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again.  After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker's strike, I expected the sense of excitement to continue.  It simply never does.  Summary of "In Dubious Battle" - Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  Workers get mad.  Workers get tired.  The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking.  And while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book.  Most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense...  ...and eating.  Steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story, because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding, eating, and (worst of all) TALKING about food.  There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes to mind.  Steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters.  But I advise any reader of "In Dubious Battle" to take this course - after the strike is initiated, simply set the book down.  You won't miss anything.  Nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces.  I suppose now I'll give "Grapes of Wrath" a go.  Perhaps if it isn't one of his "greats," it isn't worth reading 
 Forgive me, but after watching this festering pustule of a movie I've simply got to rant a bit. I normally don't trash films, but this one deserves it SO badly... I'm sorry.  This is a movie that's about as interesting as watching grass grow. A chimp with a camcorder would shoot something more interesting. I wish I could give it a negative rating but the pop-up menu only allows a "1 star" as the lowest.  I can't remember a movie where the audience's time is wasted any more completely than with this crapathon. You know when you go to someone's house and they show you home movies of their trip to the beach? And you have to sit through two hours of not much going on while their kids play in the sand... and you keep looking at your watch wondering when it will ever end?  Well, that's "Raiders of the Lost Ark" compared to "Open Water 2".  The Three Stooges are brain surgeons compared to the characters in this movie, the writing and story are laughably bad and the director makes Ed Wood look like Martin Scorcese.  Maybe they ran out of money before being able to complete the movie they originally intended to make... because if not, those who made this pitiful excuse for entertainment should be thrown off a boat somewhere as payback for the time they caused everyone who watched this stinking dung heap to waste.  Pretentious, annoying, stupid on a monumental level. This movie makes Catwoman, Basic Instinct 2, Jaws 4, etc. all look like Citizen Kane.  
 3D Home Architect is a complete crock. I have attempted to use it many times. After hours of reading and playing with it I am still unable to perform the most simple task. I own V1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years. I also spent lots of time trading emails with Broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and I got nothing. So henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $. Sorry 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 "The Man Who Sold the World" is an album that established a reputation-- David Bowie, pop songster and pyschedelic folkster, did a dramatic about-face and reinvented himself as a dark metal rocker.  In 2006, this sort of reinvention of Bowie is something that was expected, but in 1970, this must have been rather unexpected.  Influencing this change was no doubt the presecne of guitar hero Mick Ronson, whose embracing of distortion and feedback made this entirely possible.  The results of this change, quite honestly, are a lot more mixed then most Bowie fans would lead you to believe-- "The Man Who Sold the World" has been elevated to cult status and truthfully it's not that the album is bad per se, it's just that it's not particularly exciting.  Bowie lets us know right away that things have changed-- "Width of a Circle" is an extended cut drenched in feedback and distorted guitars with a galloping bassline (played by producer Tony Visconti) and a rambling vocal from Bowie.  No doubt it woke a lot of people up as to the change of direction, and it proves to be a decent number.  But Bowie seems incapable of really sustaining this and seems unsure how to integrate it into his idiom-- "All the Madmen" starts as a bleak acoustic ballad before overdriven guitars and a downright irritating synth line get in the way, "After All" ends up being a dull Lou Reedish ballad, and many of the metalish pieces are pretty much unmemorable ("She Shook Me Cold", the lyrically fantastic "Running Gun Blues").  The album closes on a high note, with the bizarre folk/metal fusion title track (made famous decades later by Nirvana's performance of it on MTV) and the fractured, paranoid, and downright bizarre metal churn of "The Superman", but the album is a bit too inconsistent to be a completely satisfying listen.  There's enough on here to make it worth a pickup for those exploring Bowie's catalog, but he'd do siginificantly better work in the very near future.  This one is more a curiosity 
 Sean sings like Yoko.  To quote another reviewer, "Leave the music to Julian,"  PLEASE!  Does any more need to be said 
 Interested in this book?  Don't be, let me sum it up, use some wood as a target, walk back ten paces, and throw the knife until it sticks.  Once it does, keep on practicing.  That really is it!  A total waste of money 
 The book is about 50% actual negotiating tactics and 50% political commentary.  There were some interesting ideas insofar as negotiating strategies, but nothing really unique.  The author comes across as a combination of an friendly, lovable uncle and the Jack Lemmon character in Glengarry Glen Ross.  His political commentaries showed a breathtaking shallowness and lack of historical knowledge...such as his statement that the Western world's confrontation with the Islamic world began in 1979(?!).  In the appendices, Cohen includes several memorandums to top officials in various administrations which provide insight to a neo-con understanding of the world. That such an underdeveloped grasp of geopolitics occupies a large portion of the book throughout is disappointing, and seems to influence Mr. Cohen's thoughts on negotiating.  
 The film starts out very promising, an idyllic and relaxing flow through nature and natural housing that is habited by one ex-commune member Jack and his daugther Rose, alone in a world left with all the time to work and play and look at clouds in the sky.  Unfortunately, Jack is having heart difficulties, and worried by Rose's promise to die with him, he invites his girlfriend's family over to take care of them.  Too bad his experiment in raising a completely innocent girl made her too innocent, because now the arriving family is a threat to everyone's sanity.  There's quite a lot going on in this film as far as characters are concerned.  Jack, the person always trying to control everything around him so that it can all live harmoniously together, has much more going on with his character than he realizes.  Rose is blindly in love with her father, even incestuously.  Kathleen, Jack's girlfriend, is a "normal person", but she carries a severe savior complex.  Her two sons suffer from being an overweight, maybe gay hair stylist and a demented, forceful counter-culturist.  Every character in the film is painted distinctly and forceably, creating drama and character development that goes into depths that it almost doesn't even have to.  In fact, this movie plays a lot like a first draft.  The characters and story are realized well enough, but the writer/director Rebecca Miller never really takes them out of her head enough for anyone else to really share their experiences with them.  The story itself follows a certain arch, with all the necessary continuances of beginning, middle, end, climax and endouement, character development and motivation, but by the end of the film it's quite clear that Miller doesn't actually know what the story is.   There would be a lot of symbolism, mostly Americana.  The fact of the matter is that every character quite easily represents a side of America, an aspect that each holds dear and maintains even when falling into conflict with another aspect.  Yet the overall thesis of the work is entirely lost.  It was starting to grasp its message at the end, but then lost it in the epilogue.  This is a story about a bunch of characters.  That do stuff.    Whatever the movie did have in terms of storytelling, however, was lost completely in the direction.  While the photography was pretty good and definitely gave enough lovely imagery to look at, the camera itself never seemed to be put in the right place.  Ninety percent of this movie is in close-up, for no other reason than that it seems Miller didn't figure there was anything else to focus on.  Editing and action is cut fast and frantically in an effort to hide the fact that the shot itself isn't really that important.  In all reasonableness, this work doesn't want to be a movie.  What it does have, and what is basically the only thing one can fall back on, is superb performances.  Being that the characters are instrumental and that the performers are very good, the overall grace of the drama is what sustains one's attention enough to sometimes even forget that they're watching something not completely developed yet.  In the end, this is a performance piece, not a film, and makes a good rough draft to a work that may someday be fully developed.  (... 
 "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a married man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a son and heir."  And that is how Pemberley, Emma Tennant's sequel to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, begins.  The opening sentence drew me to the novel.  I liked the throwback of Austen's opening sentence of P&P and thought it was quite clever... that is until I noticed that Tennant does this throughout the whole novel.  I became annoyed with that, but that wasn't the worst part of this novel.  More on that later.  This sequel centers on family and friends gathering at Pemberley for Christmas.  There are the worries centered on Mrs. Bennett and how she and her silly younger daughters would behave during their stay.  Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth also have to worry about Lydia and Mr. Wickham and Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  And there are, of course, the (very predictable) conflicts centered on Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth's inability to have a child.  And to make things worse for them, Mr. Darcy may be -- gasp! -- the father of an illegitimate child!  I know this has very likely been brought up in other reviews, but I feel I have to vent.  First of all, Jane and Elizabeth got married on the same day.  There is a one-year time lapse in this installment.  Why is it that Jane has a one-year-old little girl (when in fact this child should have been a newborn if it had been conceived during their honeymoon) and is about to give birth to another child?  All in one year?!  Then there is Lydia.  She married Wickham a few months before Jane and Lizzy got married.  And she has four children of various ages.  Am I missing something here?  Newsflash for Ms. Tennant: only animals could have multiple pregnancies in one year.  Then there is the complete destruction of our beloved characters.  Lizzy is an emotional disaster and a pushover here, throwing tantrums and crying at everything.  There isn't the slightest trace of the intelligent, spirited and witty Lizzy that we all know and love.  And Mr. Darcy?  Tennant turns him into a pompous, brooding jerk.  He may have been arrogant in P&P, but we all know that he gains some humility by the end and we also learn that underneath that arrogant exterior lies an honorable gentleman.  But here we're back to square one and then some.  And -- oh! -- Georgiana hates Lizzy?  She teams up with Miss Bingley to speak ill of Lizzy behind her back and make her life miserable?  What the hell?  In Pride and Prejudice, Georgiana is a shy, proper young woman who likes Lizzy the moment she meets her.  Tennant has reduced this character to a villainess in a bad soap opera.  Ick!  Mr. Bingley is once again trashed and turned into a rake of sorts (I say once again because this was done to him in another P&P sequel I recently read).  He is the father of an illegitimate child in this one (remember the out-of-wedlock child that is believed to be Mr. Darcy's I mentioned in my previous paragraph?).  I also hate the fact that the author kills off one of my favorite characters: Mr. Bennett.  Why, oh why did the author get rid of such a wonderful and hilarious character?  His bantering with Mrs. Bennett were my favorite parts of Pride and Prejudice. Anyway, I could go on forever with the inconsistencies and lack of continuity in this novel (and believe me, there's more!), so I'll move on to anachronisms.  Regency women did not talk about douche among themselves during tea time, much less in front of men.  And even though Mrs. Bennett could be quite vulgar and blunt, not even she would give advice on how to conceive a son in the company of men.  And how would she know about conceiving a son?  She has five daughters and no sons!  Furthermore, this novel did not have a feel of Regency England at all.  And all of this, dear readers, in just 184 pages!  I'd hate to think what other errors this author would have concocted had she made this novel longer.  I could only reach the conclusion that Ms. Tennant has never read Pride and Prejudice.  As for using similar quotes from P&P... well, maybe she found them in Cliffs Notes or something.  Pemberley wouldn't have been so bad if she had intended to rewrite the original novel and not do a continuation of it (that still wouldn't explain the multiple births in one year though).  This novel is just plain bad.  Don't waste your time with it. *End of venting.*  Phew!  I feel better now 
 I believe threat modelling is a concept you either get or you don't--like how for some people building things comes naturally, but for others it's breaking things. This book attempts to formalize and codify the creative thought process of the latter while over-emphasizing its importance and severely trivializing the effort required to do it. Let's face it, creating a threat model for a telephone or a single web page is one thing, but doing it for a complex client-server application or networked system is a serious undertaking.  Strange that I don't recall the book ever mentioning the threat modelling software tool free from Microsoft (which they should have included on a CD with the book), given the pervasive "not invented here" attitude in the book and the numerous plugs for or from other Microsoft people. Having a software tool to assist with or at least record threat models is a great idea because make no mistake, threat modelling is a worthwhile endeavor. But no one's going to make diagrams by hand.  Speaking of diagrams, I found those in the book to be unnecessarily curvy and asymmetrical, making them difficult to read. A diagram should either be intuitive at first glance or flow nicely from one section to another--this book's diagrams are just a mess. Except perhaps the attack trees; not a new concept to security pros, these were the most sensical diagrams in this book about diagramming. Color would have been welcome to better differentiate the various pieces, and at least rough threat modelling seems to lend itself to the whiteboard, on which you can write using a rainbow of colors.  The book is also full of new terminology--which isn't such a bad thing if it's trying to standardize the disparate threat modellers' vocabularies, but it's not--and acronyms, from DREAD to STRIDE to "SPMs" in both cases seemingly presented as a refresher of historical fact. One term the book uses repeatedly (and repetitiveness is rampant) is penetration testing, mentioning that threat models make good pen test plans. Unfortunately pen testers think differently than this book seems to try to persuade threat modellers to think: certain attack vectors are summarily dismissed whereas a pen tester would take whatever he could get. The book also mentions code review as a testing tool, but never seems to say much about the traditional software QA tester playing a role.  Another blow to the book's potential value is the fact that the last third is devoted to threat model examples. Since the three example targets are discussed throughout the book it doesn't make sense to me to do this rather than in context. In general the book is too drawn out and would have been better suited to a whitepaper. It makes reference to Writing Secure Code which also covers threat modelling, as well as Assessing Network Security (yet another Microsoft book, go figure) which isn't a bad book but is less on-topic than perhaps the non-Microsoft title not referenced, How to Break Software Security.  While the subject of the book is important, and the book's introduction does a good job of getting the reader's attention, I don't think this book is worth the cover price or the time it'll take you to suffer through its dry presentation, unless you've been assigned to do threat modelling in your job and you have no idea where to begin. In that case you should definitely download Microsoft's free tool for it as well 
 I have had two of these units (SG2 and an SG4) and all I can say is "don't believe the hype".  While the units are an unbelievable concept on TV and work (NOTE: WHEN THEY WORK) great, the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by Skygolf is, by itself, sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena.  Just to relay my experience (and keep in mind I have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units), it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original SG2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software (ie-endless restarts).  When the SG2 was stolen at an event, I purchased an SG4 to obtain the next generation of the product.  Since the January 2, 2007, purchase date, I have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours (including one Saturday morning, prior to a Sunday event, when they requested I attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5AM (NO, that is not a typing error on my part!) California time).  I have purchased/received (Skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation) and returned three SG4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged.  I have attempted to download the software and access the website via the SG4 on five different computers and EVERY SINGLE SERVICE PACK OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000.  Even after I forwarded Skygolf the computer log to show them the problem (software error) neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational.  At this point, all I can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating (to echo another review) it is to deal with the people behind the product.  No product, no matter how fabulous in concept, is worth this level of incompetence during set-up and operation.  Good luck to you if you purchase the product.  I hope your experience is better than mine. 
 I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.   Concerned in Alabam 
 The spice rack looks nice.  Won't know the quality until I can use it and see how much weight it will take.  I had a horrible time getting in under the cabinet.  It is definitely a 2-person job and there was only me.  The self-adhesive tabs didn't work at all even to just put the spice rack up to use the screws.  Very awkward to use the screws.  Doesn't allow for any room especially the back screws.  I did the wrong thing by taking the extending arm hardware off to get the spice rack in place and to make it easier to screw it under the cupboard and that is where it sits.  Now to get the hardware back onto the extender arms is almost impossible.  I wouldn't have purchased this knowing how hard it is to attach to the underneath of the cabinet.  Took much too much time to get it into place 
 I enjoyed the book so much that I ran out and bought the DVD.  Although it was well-cast and entertaining to a degree, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed.    For starters, this 4-hour miniseries is FAR too long.  It dragged on painfully at times and could easily have been cut by a full hour (and very possibly two).  Also, it focuses almost entirely on the struggle of the main characters while omitting most of the interesting scientific narrative and anecdotes that make the book so fascinating.  The impact of the story is severely diminished without this narrative.  Moreover, I think it is difficult to figure out what is happening during most of the series unless you have read the book first.  It is unclear why many of the secondary characters exist, and their interactions with the main characters are virtually inscrutable at times.  All in all, it is obvious that a significant effort went into this series but I think it could have been better 
 I remember this movie back in the 70's as being much, much funnier. I bought it. I saw it and I will never watch it again. It is in the give away pil 
 This book is based on a common mistake about Tituba, namely that she was African.  After all, everyone associates slaves in America with Africa; Tituba is also described as 'black.'  However, 'black' in the lexicon of the Puritans meant 'Indian.'  Rev. Samuel Parris, who owned Tituba and hence was in a position to know, refers to her in legal documents as an Indian.  Modern scholars have concluded that Tituba came from one of the Caribbean Indian groups or from South America.  Moreover, it has long been known that the witchcraft she can be proved to have practiced was common English magic.  Finally, the notion that there was some group of girls being instructed in witchcraft by Tituba stems from a careless reading of a remark in John Hale's account of the Salem episode.  Hale wrote that one of the afflicted girls indicated to him that she had been trying to find out her future husband's occupation; Hale then mentions an acquaintance (not necessarily one of the afflicted girls) who had indulged in the same practice.  Tituba is never mentioned by Hale in this context and only two unassociated women practitioners of magic are alluded to. 
 La Pucelle is not well served here. This is a pretty mediocre, superficial treatment of Joan's life. Gordon brings a novelist's flair to what amounts to a somewhat stream-of-consciousness extended essay. Gordon likes Shaw's play, SAINT JOAN, and you can see how Shaw's view of Joan's voices/religious identity clearly shaped Gordon's perspective. Stick with Regine Pernoud's various books on Joan, which are superior in every aspect to this flawed offering 
 I bought this book hoping to learn more about Islam. But as I started to read the book it was more of a -how to convert your Muslim friends to Christianity- book. I am not interested in converting Muslims to Christianity, but if you are, this book would be helpful. It helps to show the similarities between the two religions, but talks about showing Muslims the way of Christ and the Bible more than it does explain Islam. The info on this book should have been more specific on what it was about 
 I found this book disgusting in more ways than one. Is Ms. Klum really targeting women who feel they need to re-vamp their bodies, images, sex lives, etc? In other words, the average, moderately insecure woman? Wow, it really makes me feel special to see PAGES AND PAGES--even the inside of the front and back sections--filled with images of an airbrushed, overworked Heidi Klum. How can anyone aspire to that virtually unreachable level (as if Ms. Klum is anyone special without her makeup artist and hair colorist)? Certainly not someone who is taking the time to read this book. If you're in the mood for getting your ego stomped on or for seeing Ms. Klum in a book riddled with soft porn, shovel up the eighteen bucks and ENJOY 
 peeps, if you want a good ministry album, try amazon.CO.UK!!  The club scene is MUCH bigger there and has the best DJ's in the world and so .co.uk has a much bigger choice of dance albums!  Check it out 
 When Professor Polk describes the sweep of history in Iraq, he is at his best, but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts.  Much of the political ranting is supposition, marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work. The ranting gets especially tedious towards the end.  My advice, read the first part and skip the last half 
 7 out of the 25 disks would not write.  I didnt much care for the product considering this factor.  
 one piece of advise: get your bachelor's degree in neuroscience, then go ahead and attempt this book. i was extremely frustrated by the complexity of this book and im a sophomore neuroscience student. im just confused as to why this book was aimed at the general public. there are tons of other books that are more understandable, and interesting. check out crick's "the astonishing hypothesis" and koch's "the quest for consciousness", they are more worth the money and time. if you're looking for first hand experience of a brain aneurysm then buy this book, it'll give you one lickity split...that's likely the only thing you'll learn about the brain from this book 
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 This book is a revision of a German edition first published in 1971. If that were not enough to put the book out-of-date, the author's writing style certainly would. Her prose is "romantic"  English:  "She offers him [a man who changes her flat] 'tyre' an embroidered handkerchief, which he politely refuses. He makes no reply and, as she gets back into the car, gallantly shuts the door for her." (p. 4). To the extent that the author received death threats, one may have come from a paperback writer whose books sell best in drugstores. 
 While I have all of Ina's previous cookbooks and use them frequently, this is a cookbook that I can't say I've made much use of at all.  The recipes don't have as much appeal to me as the recipes from her prior books.  They seem a bit fussier to make (in keeping with French cooking, no doubt), but not only that, the food itself simply doesn't seem as appetizing.  I realize this is simply a matter of taste, but had I actually spent the money to purchase this book (I received it as a gift), I would have been extremely disappointed.  Perhaps my day to day life doesn't call for recipes such as Bouef Bourguignon and Filet of Beef au Poivre.  And as charming as Ina can be, reading the personal details of her idyllic life with Jeffrey in France does get just a tad bit nauseating...I would highly recommend sticking to food, and particularly the food that Ina made so popular in the Hamptons.   
 Don't waste your time reading this book - this book is awful! This book was supposed to be so good, according to the other reviews, and it's definitely not a good novel. In fact, this is by far the worst novel I have read in my life. I think one of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head - most of this book just seems like random writing and ultimately it has no real purpose for carrying forward the plot line. Indeed, it definitely seems like he was just trying to meet a word count for the publisher. The edition of the book I read was slightly over 700 pages, and it could have easily been reduced to 300 without affecting in any way the plot line. Thus the reader is left to swallow 400 pages of pointless writing that just seems like "waffling" to mention the term used in England to describe writing that leads you no where. Not only that, but the 300 pages devoted to actually explaining the plot are not that interesting anyway. The plot line of the novel is incredibly implausible; a prince who is an "idiot" but on occasions doesn't seem like such an idiot after all and who suffers from a mysterious illness of "idiocy" that could not be labelled as an actual illness by modern medicine. Moreover, one of the principal characters in the novel, Aglaia Yepanchin supposedly is madly in love with the prince while at the same time making fun of him in a very rude way right in front of his nose - am I the only one here who thinks this is JUST a little implausible? And then just to make matters worse, and as an appetizer after having to swallow 650 pages of horrible writing, near the end of the novel Dostoyevski puts in the mouth of the prince two full pages of the most outrageous slander against the Catholic religion I have read in my life. Supposedly, according to Dosteyvski, atheism comes from the Catholic religion - certainly Dosteyevski doesn't hide his hatred for the Catholic faith. Even atheists would laugh at such an absurd proposition 
 I was disappointed with the book. Like the others, the book lost what little integrity I was willing to give it to start when Catherine said she lived in 1863 BC. Given that the author repeatedly states that he is a traditionally-trained medical professional, his material is starkly lacking in any kind of verifiable fact or scientific questioning. The book reads like a personal diary of someone who is searching for meaning in his life rather than a case study. I think the thing that bothered me the most is that it is obvious he uses the patient for his own purposes in sessions that he allows to go on for hours on end to await messages from the Masters. Seems unethical to me (a lesson he must still need to learn.) I thought it especially odd that the first other professional he brings into to observe a session is his wife and not an objective colleague.  I read many of the reviews below and I like what one said about past lives recollection being born from the mental garbage of the Earth. That seems more likely. I encourage you to keep searching for the truth. Do not settle for the soul candy offered in this book 
 The chief problem with this book is that the writer incorporates the French perspective by using citations in French with no translations.  I took 2 years of high school French but I'm not that good!  This could be overlooked except that, for obvious reasons, I was very interested to hear the perspective of French writing on this lopsided defeat.  The experience was like someone telling a long joke and them mumbling the awaited punchline, or someone tearing out the last page of a riveting mystery novel.  I simply can't believe key citations weren't translated.    Otherwise the study of Henry V was great, and I would like to hear more about him (except since he died young I probably heard it all already.)  The treatment of the battle was superficial, but perhaps given the lack of material this could be understood, but more could be done 
 I thought this book would deal only with the 2nd Iraq war but was mistaken.  About half this book described the history of Iraq.  The actual war coverage was broad and brief.  This book lacks much of the detail of previous Keegan books.  John Keegan has written many superb books in the past but this one was a disappointment 
 I only spent lunch money in renting this, if only to confirm that Ulli Lommel productions are staying consistent.  As someone who reads about high profile crimes quite often, I was initially attracted to Lommel's works after reading books on serial killer's "The Zodiac" and the "Green River Killer".  Since there seemed to be movies on the shelf regarding these cases, I decided to check them out.  Both were by Ulli Lommel, and both productions were atrocious.  This one, unfortunately, is no different.  First off is the way this is marketed.  Lommel's DVD's continue to be on the main shelves of my rental store, alongside major feature films.  Now I understand he is not Spielberg and his actors and actresses are not the likes of Hackman or Paltrow.  However, in viewing the cover as well as the photo stills on the back of the DVD case, I would assume I am going to be watching a film that is a portrayal of the case at hand, and is done in professional quality in regards to actors, special effects, lighting and sound.     Lommel didn't disappoint.  The amateur filmmaking coupled with a multitude of inaccuracies regarding the case the film is featured on leaves me wondering why or how this stuff even gets into a DVD rental store in the first place.  This is way below "B-grade" people, this is pretty much garbage.  It's really not any different than if you got your second cousin and his friend from the bakery down the street to act in it.  Grab your 1988 camcorder, Throw in a Coleman flashlight for extra lighting and a dull, inept soundtrack and you have your Lommel production!  Oh, I take that back, with permission you could have gotten some Skynyrd or Zeppelin no here just to add to the period when the murders happen, but then that would be wishful thinking.  The inaccuracies are to numerous to mention, but suffice it to say that it has little to do with Dennis Rader and his ability to escape authorities for nearly 25 years.  It does not portray law enforcement well at all, and does not show any of the things they did right and wrong that would culminate in his eventual capture.  The scenes of Rader hauling around insects and rats in a basket are not true, and I have no idea why this was even added to the film.  The real Dennis Rader had enough disturbing things going on inside his head, so having him haul around spiders did nothing but take away from the realism of the BTK case.  Another thing to note here is the order in which victims died when.  I don't even think Ulli knows; he just made an amateur film based on the BTK and filled in the rest with his own ideas.  From the pattern I see, Lommel takes high profile crimes, particularly serial killer stories, and capitalizes on them.  If you are looking for a movie that is based on one of these crimes, be careful.  Make sure to read who it is produced by, because Lommel not only makes terrible produced films (again, camcorder quality with people who are not even contemporary film actors) but also covers the stories facts with a vomit all his own.  Word is that Ridley Scott is actually going to be doing a movie about this case, and it will star Eric Bana as one of the detectives.  There is still hope in the Promised Land, although I'm sure next year Lommel will make a movie about some other high profile crime, barring the batteries in the camcorder don't stop working on him during production 
 My husband is Icelandic, and unfortunately this book was NO help at all... It's perfectly fine for the traveller, but in trying to live everyday life, conversing with new family members forget it. I would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section, something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand. If you are quite serious about learning this language I would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive Colloquial Icelandic.  For me at least, it's quite easier to understand, has complete grammatical charts in the back, as well as a fairly decent dictionary...  Again, if you are only learning for business trips and such, then this would be a good option... For those of us actually moving there, her book is not so good.. 
 The book, "The Future is Mestizo" is NOT written BY Sandra Cisneros.  Thats is false advertisement!!!  The book is written by some biased priest, who has a good idea, however, Sandra Cisneros did not write the book.  She wrote the foreword.    Please contact me for a FULL refund and I will send the book back.  Thank you 
 This movie will not start without giong to the scene starter.  Grandchildren cannot start the movi 
 I was promised 1-2 day shipping and didn't get it.  I was promised reciept by Dec. 6th and haven't gotten it 
 I gave 2 star for this CD not because of the musical quality...but because the last song "Goodnight My Love" is cut short on this CD. After watching the live performance on cable, I rushed out to buy this CD, labeled by Hybrid. Only to find out my favorite song "Goodnight My Love" was cut short. On the CD, it ends with  the sax doing a solo then fades away....which leaves the song dangling and unfinished!!!   On the video, this song ends with Art singing "bring you closer to me" and the music slowly ends beautifully, correctly. There's a version out which was released by Sony in 2003. I don't know if this version contains the full song. The Hybrid Label version is simply ridiculous!!!  How can you possibly end such a beautiful song short!! leaving it unfinished....and well....SHORT and listeners wanting more!!!  If someone can verify if the Sony conatins the full "Goodnight My Love"...or tell me where I can get this verson,  would really appreciate it 
 First and foremost, do your job as a U.S. Senator. Stop the book tour doing self promotion. How is the real estate issue going? Please explain!! 
  This book was entirely disappointing for me. I read it in hopes of finding a better understanding and instead found 2 people who sound very bitter and are trying to sell a book through humor and not real facts. Some of their advice include using sex as the "ultimate bargaining too" and ways to "realisticaly rate yourself in a scale of 1-10" and stay in your own playing field(like don't aim for a 8 if you're really only a 5). Scary stuff. This book really depressed me until my (Married) friends pointed out how utterly ridiculous it was. If you are single and searching, stay away from this book 
 I agree with all the other one star reviews (would give it zero if I could).  The author is a snob who  doesn't see the people whose lives she is supposedly reporting on as human beings in any way equal to herself.  If they take their "menial" jobs seriously she looks down on them.  She demeans hard work and celebrates entitlement.  For another view of the poor with some conception of how people's behavior shapes their lives, read LIFE AT THE BOTTOM. 
 Yes, I bought this enormous dollhouse- I saw the low price, and thought "how cool" : the dollhouse I never had growing up.  Reviewers are right- it's total junk. It's made mostly of particle board, and apparently cheap particle board at that.  You really can't move it, as folks said, it starts to come apart.  So, I would suggest looking elsewhere- I think Hearthsong might have a nice wooden dollhous 
 Being a fan of this type of literature, I couldn't wait to watch this.  But I hadn't read the book.  About 15 minutes into it, I couldn't stand the boredom and never finished watching the movie.  However, if you are a fan of the book and a Thomas Hardy fan, it's probably a must for your collection 
 I've enjoyed Trinny and Susannah's other books and picked up quite a few tips from those, but this book has me shaking my head. Worst is the career-dressing advice: it might be fine if you've got an entry-level position, but if you're at a managerial or professional level, forget it! For one thing, Trinny and Susannah seem to have a strong allergy to suits or, for that matter, any clothes that are conservative or classic. Well, trendy doesn't work for everybody, and it doesn't work all the time. Some of their "don'ts" work as well as, or even better, than their "do's". And some sections are overlong; do we really need numerous versions of skiwear and after-ski wear 
 This may be a five-star concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired, particularly in the illustrations. The best that can be said is that the pictures are deeply colored and might make a good stained-glass project. However, the almost uniformly bird's-eye view of this "global village" fails to show much difference between the haves and have-nots, or, really, to illustrate the facts of any given page. We simply see a colorful village from the air... over and over.  The very imagery that might make these facts come alive in a child's imagination is missing. Some sense of interaction - this is a village, after all! - would help. Instead of faces, we are given a fly-over. Thus, the facts remain mere lists, and not emotionally compelling 
 ***contains some slight spoiler alert***  I have enjoyed Mags' detective work for years, though at times, her naivety has been a bit unbelievable (and annoying).  However, what began as a top notch story, suffered from the author's lapse of not accounting for all the dead bodies.  Maybe the discovery of the perpetrator is so surprising that people don't care why he/she did what they did, but motives have always been important to me.  Myers only explains one of the deaths, which leaves me to wonder, why did the killer kill the other person?  That kinda ruined the story for me.  To me that speaks of laziness and whereas in real life we may not know why criminals do what they do, in a work of fiction, that question should be answered.  If Myers didn't want to answer it, then she could have at least said, "We'll never know why ###### killed ######" or "##### killed ####*# to throw me off the scent." But she doesn't do this.  It's like that other murder never happened.  It's been awhile since I read Assault and Pepper and maybe after some time off I'll discover this lost motive.  If Myers really didn't put it in, then I may be done with this series.  How can you read a mystery and not be confident that all questions pertaining to the mystery will be wrapped up at the end?  Books (like movies) should make sense...and yes, I spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about what I've just read (or watched) to see it all makes sense.  Yes, I need help! lo 
 This is a very strange book: it isn't a book of philosophy and it isn't a book for practice on Personal Time Management.  If you are a CEO or a Vice president you could find something useful (but we hope you've a philosophycal background far more interesting than this book suggests..) but if you're a down on the earth worker .... forget it! When your chief demands the impossible ... explain her/him that  you're a value oriented people and .... find yourself ... fired in 2 seconds!!!  
 In 1872 Charles Darwin's "The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals" addressed how emotions were an evolutionary adaptative process of the human species. In that book and in other similar books since (e.g., Johnston's "Why We Feel: The Science of Human Emotions," 1999), evolutionary biologists have shown that the adaptative function of emotions is to get us moving very quickly without having to rationalize or think about imminent perils as we had to do in our earlier hunter-gather society. In 1995, Daniel Goleman in his pioneering book "Emotional Intelligence" brought many of these evolutionary and scientific ideas to the attention of modern readers, advocating much greater attention be paid to developing healthy emotions in all of us, beginning in grade school and in the home. Now, Goleman returns in a book that highlights a symposia consisting of philosophers, psychologists, doctors, and the Dali Lama to see what insights Eastern thought in general, and Tibetan Buddhism in particular, might glean for us. The effort, while noble, has very little to recommend it.  Most of the book tangentially describes the goings on of the symposium itself; hardly electrifying knowledge! The rest of the book tries to correlate (where possible) Eastern Buddhist thought about emotions with the modern Western scientific paradigm. Often, this is no more than using Tibetan language for English terms. The neo-Darwinian prototype is occasionally raised, but never fully addressed. Then, in a systematic fashion, the emotions, affects, afflictions, emotional balance, etc., are described in a metaphysical context of how the Dali Lama and other lamas regard Western insights. Some spiritualists, transcendentalists, Eastern philosophers, and religionists may find the Dali Lama's comments insightful, but I found them bordering on the naive and over simplistic. Don't we already know (in the West, at least) that some emotions are healthy while others are simply inappropriate? It doesn't require new semantics in old wineskins to show us what we already know.   There's no question that some of the emotions we've developed over epochs of evolution no longer serve our modern-day purposes (although this isn't even explored). Further, there's no question that some people have either excessive or deficient emotions that could benefit from a reappraisal and some reeducation. For example, while anger in some people may precipitate compassion for the injured or harmed (a good effect), others blow off steam with weapons, familial abuse, and inappropriate agitation (bad effect). So, what's new about this insight? Nothing. Goleman does devote a chapter to writing about "schooling" the good effects from bad, but I found the reeducation slender and lanky (e.g., "our secular goal should be to support a healthy emotional immune system"). The analogy and metaphor are quaint, but not very descriptive or prescriptive of the reeducation program.  Emotions, according to most scientists as opposed to the doctrinaire religionists, are generally regarded as a normal and healthy part of our intrinsic human nature (see Johnston, supra., Pinker, "How the Mind Works," Wright, "The Moral Animal," Ridley, "Origins of Virtue," Sober & Wilson, "Unto Others," et alia). For those who suffer from inappropriate emotions, and obviously many people do, there are excellent self-help books (e.g., Cohen, "What Would Aristotle Do?" Ellis, "A Guide to Rational Living," Nussbaum, "Therapy of Desire," Burns, "Feeling Good," et alia). Reading the signposts from Eastern philosophy does little to inform us either about our emotions or how to control the inappropriate ones. Giving Western concepts Tibetan names does little to nothing to edify. Unlike Goleman's earlier book, this book not recommended 
 Nothing original here.  Nothing overly humourous.  Overall pretty bland in my opinion.  The only part I thought was really worth watching was when the casket exploded at the end.  
 As others have mentioned "Moo" has an unwieldy cast of characters which make following each subplot difficult, as characters often fail to appear again for hundreds of pages. Though some characters are noteworthy - particular the pig Earl Butz and Smiley's grasp of adolescent dialogue is flawless, I wound up skimming until I reached the climax. Personally, I much prefer the author's less bulky books such as "Barn Blind" and "A Thousand Acres" not because I don't enjoy reading complexly plotted novels, but because I feel that if you have the knack of creating memorable characters, they deserve more "screen time" so to speak 
 This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough. 
 The 24 show is twisted into an unrecognizable pretzel in this middling thriller. I completely agree with the other bad reviews and warnings for 24 fans on this book. It's a fairly pedestrian, generic thriller as thrillers go but what's awful is it isn't 24. Whatever you think about Jack's worrying and agonizing in this book, "Kelly Sharpton" is the hero, hands down, not Jack Bauer. Was this guy a minor walk-on character from somewhere in season's past or did the author make him up? Whatever. I didn't sign up to read about that dude. I cracked the book open because of Jack.  It's sad to see Jack relegated to a boob for a lot of this book. Yeah, sure, he wins in the end, proves Ryan wrong, etc...but it's a heck of a long time to wait and a heck of a lot of pages to read to get there. Not like the show at all that let's you see Jack being a badass and heroic in every episode. And...(again, you have to be a fan to understand) that's the defining characteristic of the show.  There's an awful lot of "snarling" and eyes "popping open" and hearts beating against chests for what's being characterized as a well-written book. I also thought the evil ex-military white supremacist racist villains were...uh, cliche? (in concept and execution, yes). And also a missed opportunity to deal with more interesting threats in a geo-politically complicated world (Marc Cerasini's books are far superior to this one on all points--better written, better plotted, better villains, better grasp of the threats facing the U.S. and the world today. He's got Jack locked down, and is on target with what 24 should be. Vince Flynn's books are closer to the spirit of 24 than Veto Power--Flynn is consulting with the 24 writers this season.)  But back to Veto Power. It's interesting to see the Patriot Act characterized as some sort of time bomb that's a bigger threat to the U.S. than the enemies that have killed 3,000 of its citizens and wish to kill the rest. But forget the politics of whether you agree with the author's strident, constant, and less than subtle handling of his anti-Patriot Act theme. My question is: does that strike you as 24? Does 24 strike you as a show that lectures us all on how we need to worry about men like Jack Bauer and his threat to our freedoms? Do you think maybe this author thought he was writing a West Wing novel? There are certainly enough jarring and obvious (borderline juvenile) caricatures for Bush and Rove and Ashcroft (more of the author's agenda being shoved down my throat so awkwardly and obviously I had trouble getting through this book).  In sum: what I love about the 24 show is that Jack Bauer is heroic. As Joel Surnow said in an interview (Cigar Aficionado mag., check it out)--this is the only show on TV that deals with the war on terrorism in a heroic manner. I'm sorry to warn 24 fans that Jack is not heroic in this book. He's not Jack to me. It's a letdown to keep expecting Jack to take control and be the man he is in the show...but it just doesn't happen. I also miss Tony (a missed opportunity to really use him in this book) and the less said about this author's ridiculous depiction of the excellent character Nina, the better (but she isn't in it much, anyway. Most of the book features made up characters never seen in 24). Too bad. This book is a missed opportunity for a good 24 read.   
 I didn't like Gruber's new book at all!  I couldn't like any of the characters, the book was way too long and in need of editing, and the contrived "finale" where the baddies get their just rewards was ridiculous.  In fact, Gruber himself seemed to imply a Hollywood disconnect from realism by constantly talking about how the scene would play out as a movie.  Reading the silly letters from Bracegirdle were as boring as watching paint dry.  The  letters could have been much shorter and still served the purpose of the plot and story.  There's an entire page devoted to discussion of Polish cinema/Roman Polanski--is that paint dry yet?  Gruber throws so many fakes and reverses as to be absurd.  The manuscript is fake--but wait!  No it's not a fake!  Oh wait...yes it is, how silly we were to think it could be real.  But now we know we were wrong before...it IS real!  I stopped caring after a while.  It took me two weeks to finish this book.  I had to make myself keep going (just to punish myself, I guess) and finish this lemon.  Lastly, Jake Mishkin was a jerk and not a realistic character.  I kept hoping he'd be hit by a car and the book would prematurely end.  But it didn't.  It kept on going and going and going...  I picked this one up because the USA Today review was so favorable, but that reviewer must be the sort who thinks The Secret is revolutionary and insightful.  Skip this one unless you're a serious insomniac looking for a cure 
 Hugh Farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play Bridge.  His college-age daughter Karen, her friend Barbara, his lawyer son Duke, his alcoholic wife Grace, and house servant Joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit.  Everyone scrambles to safety inside Hugh's modern bomb shelter.  As the bombs fall and his wife is passed out, Hugh starts up an affair with his daughter's friend Barbara, right in the shelter.  As if Hugh's shallowness and arrogance wasn't enough to turn you against the protagonist, this nauseating little scene will.  When the shakes and quakes finally end, the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible, pristine, clean world.  At first glance, it looks like utopia, but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race, imprisoned, and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves.  Somehow, Hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in, so that he can be free with Barbara.  Of all the Apocalypse Fiction, this book is the worst.  The protagonist is so lowbrow, so arrogant, so unlikable, so self-centered, so shallow, so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest.  He's not even a "love to hate" person.  The dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant, and Barbara and Hugh's constant prattlings of "Darling, Dear, and Beloved" do not fit the characters.  Neither does Hugh's occasional spouting of words like "shall" and "shan't" along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the "N" word.  There is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of Hugh's daughter and Barbara's friend Karen, cannibalism, castration (Hugh cared more about his "boys" than he did his real children), pedophilia, racism, and $exual slavery, they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut.  The entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it, as if the author himself didn't quite believe his story.  And if he doesn't believe, how can he expect the reader to?  Overall, there is no depth or flavor in this story at all, other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight, as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door.  I recommend avoiding this book. 
 It has tons of information; both fresh and processed foods, but I found it difficult to look at the pages.  The cheap, greyish, mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading, but when you're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do.  After looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore, I finally found one compact book with medium stock, bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just $2 more.  The Ultimate Calorie, Carb, & Fat Gram Counter by Lea Ann Holzmeister.  I recommend that one over the Netzer book 
 Ignoring the normal quibbles anyone would have with anthologies' selections is easy when you check out Payne and Hunter's volume--or, rather, try to check it out. Like others in the Blackwell series, _Renaissance Literature_ is rendered useless by its size print: far too small to be seen comfortably for even a moment, far FAR too small if you'd like to read, say, _The Faerie Queen_. Not recommended, not recommendable 
 I found this book to be easy to read, but severely outdated.  The author also took a very alarmist stance that treated pregnancy as an illness.  I would have preferred a more balanced view like what I found in Pregnancy for Dummies, which is a very good introductory book.  I would NOT recommend this book 
 While, this book was informative, it was a chore to read. While chronological, it seemed disjointed and was difficult to finish. I couldn't believe this book won some sort of award and only slogged through it because it was a gift from someone who met the author at a wedding 
 This book is next to useless. I don't find it any more helpful than the on-line help provided with IIS. I can safely say that every issue I've ever had with IIS was better solved by searching on Google. Don't waste your money 
 Alright, I am a big fan of the Left Behind Series but the prequels do not compare at all to the original series. The third installment was the worst of the three being used to push a certain religious belief. Personally I felt it was veyr preachy and did not emphasize on the story. The book went no where, it was dry and boring and i didnt even watn to finish it but forced myself to. It picked up towards the last 30-50 pages but thats about it. If anyone is to read the prequels, the first book was the best and half of the second book was alright. But sorry to say the third was a huge dissappointment. The authos were just using the book as a tool to spread their owns beliefs. But im not bashing the Left Behind Series because it was an excellent read of suspent and thrill which was not at all present in the Rapture 
 After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.    Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?  It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.      Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial 
 i had this book to read for a class at james madison university and if your living and breathing...don't read this book. it was dry and didn't grab my attention at all.if you want facts, then this is the book for you.if you want good reading,pick another book 
 How could a great director like Tim Burton take a concept that is slam dunk good and change it so much as to kill it this bad. While it does have some good points most of this mess is just wrong. Allowing the humans to talk makes the hunting of them more cruel than in the first films when men were seen as cattle and pest. Talking humans did in the series and this movie as well. The apes come across as just cruel hunting and killing speaking animals and this sinks this turkey fast. A real let down and waste of tim 
 I loved Girl's Guide and have to agree with most of the reviewers below.  I was so looking forward to another fun, interesting read and for once could not actually finish a book, unusual for me as I will stick with anything unless it's terrible.  This book is just so boring, no spunk or humor; it just fell flat.  I am also finding the Jewish thing to be getting a bit old and overdone in novels these days...aren't there any other ethnic groups to be written about 
 I agree with the other reviews.  My four year old received the ranch as a birthday gift - none of the pieces stay together - at all.  How do you explain why the gate won't hold together - why the horse won't stand up, why the barn doors keep falling off - and what do I say to the gift giver when they see it 
 This book looks as if it went to publishing without editing.  I have read a lot psychology and find the subject interesting.  I am educated - professional engineer and attorney.  I usually understand what I am reading.  But this book forced me to re-read sentences and paragraphs because I could not understand what the authors were saying.  Often I just moved on.  Either the authors were not sure themselves or I just couldn't get it.  But two things were clear, the book is written almost exclusively in the passive voice with high-sounding amorphous words that seem to be intended to leave you either in awe or just completely frustrated.  It reads like a first draft that went straight to publishing.  My wife found reading it painful at best and she never made it through.  The authors also seemed little concerned about citing their authority.  Do they just make this stuff up?  I felt the advice was unreliable.  
 I didn't like this video for several reasons.  The rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands.  I was looking for an aerobic video.  I have Gilad - Bodies in Motion which is great but was getting bored with it since I had it for four years. Let me just say I'm sticking with Gilad because Denise does nothing for me.  You don't even feel like you had a workout with her.  She's boring.  I would recommend Gilad for aerobics and Tamilee Webb for toning.  Tamilee is awesome.   I have many of her videos and I'm a true fan of hers 
 This book is one big regurgitation of tired feminist anti-man dogma from an author who apparently has not the first clue about his subject.  I'm sure it will be well received by pseudo intellectual feminists wanting affirmation of their own misandrist prejudice, but anyone else would be wasting their time.  In a footnote to the prelude the author thanks "especially women" for providing him with information about dominant men.  He extensively cites folk customs of a particular subdivision of Algerian people and extrapolates that into a general condemnation of men and western society in general. On every page are unsupported misandrist assertions and prejudicial rhetoric.  It reads like a poorly written parody of a KKK lecture on relations between blacks and whites, except its about men and women, and he's serious.  The author beats around the bushes filling the book with page after page of common feminist hate propaganda, and then finally gets around to his real message in the Appendix, which is about "the gay and lesbian movement."  Not that he hasn't used a lot previous references to gay sexual domination though, it's in every chapter.  Apparently a gay author, he finally reveals why he has no experience or understanding of normal relationships between men and women, and why he's willing to publish anti-male dogma that promotes disharmony between women and men. If it belongs on a bookshelf so does the testimony of the Aryan Nations, the KKK and the National Socialist party.  Misandrist feminists will all like the book and vote "not helpful" to this review 
 I was disappointed.  If you are a skeptic who needs to be convinced to invest in silver, including history lessons, this is the book for you.  If you want to see specific examples of transactions, the Author's words in the Acknowledgements:  "On that note, I challenge the reader to look beyond this book and gather information to satisify yourself as to the true nature of money, precious metals, the financial system and your position as being one of the knowledgeable or not." Perhaps the Author's touted $60 for 6 months trial subscription to "The Morgan Report" will provide the answers.  But not for me.  I certainly agree to look elsewhere.  
 This movie consists of a bunch of unrelated tragedies in Los Angeles, having nothing at all to do with the Grand Canyon.    The dialog consists of people exchanging meaningless comments at cross purposes.  Nothing happens.  Nothing is decided.  Steve Martin is totally miscast in trying to be a serious character. he is better off just standing in front of a tv camera and telling jokes.  It seemed as if this movie took about 12 hours.  There is no observable plot.    After a while the screen says "The End."      
 This director mistakes lame attempts at surrealism for art. Artsy-fartsy disjointed and meaningless scenes leave the viewer benumbed and wondering what this movie is about.  Speaking Russian is no help in discovering the point of this wan effort. 
 My purchase of this book was based on Dave Ramsey's recommendation. While I thought the book was somewhat motivational and gave some useful ideas, it did not really deliver what perhaps I was expecting. My job search took a little over 48 days and I cannot say that I referred to the ook everyday during the search.  I believe that while it may be good for some who are geared to some occupations and have some particular skill sets, it is not for all. So, while I am sure it has sold many books, partially due to Mr. Ramsey's recommendation, it is clearly not the panacea that one might be searching for. You still must find a job based on what you have done in the past and convince a new employer that you can make him money. Or you must start your own business based on your abilities and desires. Mr. Miller's book may or may not be of assistance to you 
 sound the same, these guys call themselves producers?? Mas Flow and Mas Flow 2 were okay, the first Flow was 3-4 stars easy, but soon after listening to their beats you find out they all sound the same from other productions. ALSO doesn't help that every 90% of the reggaeton artist use Luny Tunes for their beatz. LOS BENJAMINS was just a weak album, not one good song/hit came out of it. We need to old producers como dj nelson, dj frank, playero, etc..e.tc.. 
 I read all these great reviews and must admit I was REALLY disappointed.  I thought it would be a yoga dvd I could do with my child and she could have fun while I got at leaset a litle of my workout in.  WRONG.  It is more like a visual encyclopedia of kid "yoga" poses.  The yoga guy talks about the pose and "kid chats" a bunch, but RARELY is the one demonstrating the poses. I do not want to suffer though it again for an exact quote but basically he says things like "Camel pose is great, do you want to be a camel???  Camels this and camels that, bla bla bla camels".  The whole while sitting there looking at you not doing the pose he is talking about and just talking while looking at the camara.  Not even telling you what to actually do, just talking up the virtues and fun of the next pose.  I would give it a 5 if it were a 2 part dvd with an actual yoga routen you could do that put all these poses together.  The host talks longer than you do the pose it felt like.  Definately not a break a sweat or high energy dvd.  LOTS of down time and chatter with NO flow or routen.  It will not remain on my shelf.  If you are looking for a DVD with tons of talk and lots of gaps between movement than this is the one for you 
 I bought basically, because I love Denisee Richards and Daryl Hanna, plus I like also Valerie Tasso, besides I am a fan of Pierre Woodman, they all appear on the film, among some well know adult stars like Dora Venter, Rita Faltoyano. But really the film is not good at all, it is slow, the elements don't match. It is sometimes hard to follow. It is really not worth buying it 
 I've read most of Godwin's books and enjoyed them, but Evensong is the exception. The pace is very slow, the flashbacks can make it difficult to follow, and the characters are never developed enough to make them interesting. Not one I would recommend as one of her best 
 No way to change the inputs on your TV. The DVD functions and the TV functions are accessed alternatly by pressing a "tv" button but there is no way to tell which the romote is aligned to. Therefore when you press the power button you have no idea which you will be powering on/off, the TV or the XBox. And if things couldn't get any dumber, if you press the eject button while the remote is in TV mode it doesn't work. The eject button is only designed to work with the XBox yet it is disabled when in TV mode?  There is also no option to program a receiver.  As many others mentioned, this remote looks nice but the people who designed it must have been drunk. Do not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money on garbage 
 This was used as a college textbook in my class, and to be blunt, I and several other classmates were shocked at the poor quality.  Spelling mistakes, poor grammar, etc. abound.  If ever a book needed a good editor, this is the one!  It escapes with 2 stars instead of 1 because the patient reader and beginner Library Science student may be able to glean some helpful advice from the text.  At the very least, it seems the late William A. Katz knew a thing or two about the subject of reference work.  I have to believe there are MANY better resources on this subject however.  If not, then someone needs to start writing, there's money to be made!  (Review edited for spelling 
 It simply scares me to think that some who read this book will believe that what it says is true. While this theory of economic imperialism isn't technically impossible, it's the kind of idea better left to an ideological blog somewhere instead of a book purporting to be a true account. Books like this make the left look as naive and stupid as Ann Coulter books make the right look bigoted and, well, stupid. This is an incredibly implausible account, and books like this, claiming to be nonfiction, undermine good writing and reporting everywhere. Shame on the author and the publisher. The only redeeming quality of this book was that it contained a list of other books published by Berrett-Koehler, the contents of which make it obvious that BK is simly a peddler of 4th rate crackpot theories, all of which appear to be of the nonfiction variety. 
 the jewish state has no future without american taxpayer dollers. israel is a dieing tree americans giving israel water will just prolong the agony 
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 Look I enjoyed the book a lot, but got nearer and nearer to the end and noticed the plot wasn't wrapping up.  I got that awful sinking feeling that I had been suckered into a book without a good ending, without closure, which I HATE.  Sure enough!  At the bottom of the last page they *FINALLY* admit "Armageddon's Children ends here.  The story will continue with the publication of Terry Brooks's next novel."  NOWHERE on the front cover, back cover or ANYWHERE ELSE but on the last page does it mention this.  I hate being manipulated, and that's why I gave the book one star, and why the publisher Del Ray/Ballantine Books will never get another cent from me 
 I got about one-third of the way through this book, and then just couldn't  continue.  This is without a doubt the worst science book I've ever (tried  to) read.  Edelman goes out of his way to use unnecessarily long, ponderous  phrases to describe simple concepts.  This is presumably meant to impress  you, but personally it makes me wonder what the author is trying to hide.   How about this: that his ideas are neither new, nor original, nor correct 
 I was reading another book written by Dr. Llaila Afrika in which he states that Avicenna was a Black Muslim and not Persian like one of the reviewers stated. [Avicenna] "and another Muslim Black named Rhazes influenced European medicine. In fact, Rhazes wrote about a hundred medical books which utilized natural foods, herbal remedies, and diets."  I would also like to know who it was that translated The Canon of Medicine? Europeans? Wouldn't that have been asking for potential biases 
 I'm a professor and I picked up this book thinking it might be useful to assign a chapter or two to students as background information for a comparative cultures course I will teach. Like many other reviewers I thought the book was remarkably poor. In addition to factual errors and tendentious interpretations, the book is incredibly poorly written. I thought it might be suitable to teach at the undergraduate level, but in fact it reads as if it were written by an undergraduate, or a very gifted high school student. At times it seems as if portions of the book weren't finished and the sentence-long paragraphs that appear in it are the remains of the outline the author wrote from. I'm saddened, but not surprised, that Cantor wrote a book like this. What does surprise me is that his editors published it in this form. Frankly, its an embarrassment. Given the enormous amount of good books on antiquity available, there is no reason to read this one 
 There are much better books on management out there than this collection of unorganized work.  Don't read this book if you're looking for new insight on management techniques.  If you're already a seasoned manager, you'll find more value in your real work environment.  This was a text for one of my MBA courses, and the rest of my MBA team (which consists of seasoned management professionals) has the same sentiments.  Spend your time elsewhere. 
 DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! there are wise people out there, and then there are some people that you worry that they actually have a voice in this world - this guy is one of them. somebody give this man a dollar to go buy a clue 
 My review appears to be inconsistent with the others.  Weeks after I received my jacket I had to take it to a seamstress to have stitching repaired in several places.  This is not following heavy use, but wearing the jacket one or two days a week walking to my car and from the car to the office.  In addition, the metal snaps should be replaced with buttons for a better look.  When considering the cost of the jacket, shipping and repairs, I should have to gone to Macys and purchased a nicer jacket.  
 If you are looking for a serious discussion of 1,000 classic films, perhaps as a starting point for your own voyage of discovery, this book is a total waste of money. Spend your money on "1001 Films You Must See Before You Die" and Roger Ebert's Great Movies series instead.  Here are some of the reasons why I do not like this book:  1--The reviews begin in 1931, which means that the book completely ignores the silent era. No book pretending to discuss the 1,000 greatest movies ever made can ignore that era. How can you ignore the best work of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd? How can you ignore the work of David Wark Griffith, such as "Birth of a Nation" and "Intolerance"? How can you ignore Eisenstein's "Battleship Potemkin" or Dreyer's "The Passion of Joan Of Arc," which many would rank among the 10 greatest films of all time?  2--The book covers only films that were reviewed in the New York Times. Thus it is limited in its scope. It ignores a large body of great films that were not reviewed in the Times for whatever reason.  3--The reviews were all written under deadline pressure, with little time for reflection and perspective. In the days before television, when the newspaper business was very competitive, many large papers published multiple editions each day, and deadline pressure was very tight. I was a newspaper reporter in my early days, and I know what it was like.  In addition, these reviews were written on typewriters, not computers. There was little opportunity for revision. The way that the page came out of your typewriter the first time around was the way that the review appeared in print.  It's only fair to point out that many of today's newspaper-based film critics, such as Roger Ebert, are able to write thoughtful reviews under deadline pressure. However, I suspect that they have more resources available to them, and more options as well, than the critics who wrote most of the reviews in this book.  The bottom line is that in most cases, the thoughtfulness and reflection are not there. Most of the reviews seem to be geared toward answering the reader's simple question, "Is the movie any good?" The reviews are more akin to Ebert and Roeper's "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" television reviews than to the far more thoughtful ones that Ebert writes for his newspaper. Any serious discussion of 1,000 great films deserves much better than that. 
 The play itself was good, but the quality of video and sound was very bad all through the DVD. The sound quality near the end of play was too bad with irregular flattering in sound and video or intermittend drop out of sound. 
 I found the book very interesting and being on a quest to explore the internal arts I went to meet Mr. Frantzis on one of his 1 day seminars/lectures in 2003. To my big surprise Mr. Frantzis appeared of very poor physical health himself. He was obese and had a hard time walking. At one time he lifted up his shirt to demonstrate a breathing technique and his stomach was huge!  The seminar/lecture was all about Qi Gong and improving one's health and looking at his body I found Mr. Frantzis suddenly not believable. A very dissappointing experience indeed 
 Although I really do like Ripley's writing and her stories, this one was shameful what she did to the memory of GWTW. I have to blame this on the editors. Scarlett was not the colorful character as in GWTW in this so called sequel. Publishers and editors should know there is no sequel worthy of the original great classic 
 I cannot understand why this book got so many good reviews. I'm not saying that if I didn't like it, no one can or should, but I really don't understand. It's so tedious. Every little thing in these unbelievable characters' lives is described to such great length. Unnecessarily so. Why do we need to know all the details about every piece of art work this guy made? A summary would do. And to take soooooo long before getting to the point. It's like half the book was merely background to the reall thing, but why so long?! And the characters don't come alive despite all those details. They don't feel like people, just mouthpieces for views on hysteria and art. No matter what, I just didn't care about any of the characters. And even as a novel of ideas, I think this one would fail. The ideas are not developed, they're described like self-gratification, something you may take from a friend but not someone you don't care about. So, clearly I didn't like this one. I would just like to understand what I missed that made all those others love the book so much 
 This movie was quite honestly one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  As a huge Colin Firth fan originally from a small town in Vermont, I thought that no matter what I had heard about the film I would enjoy it.  Unfortunately,  I was wrong.        The main problem of the film was characterization.  There were oftentimes no motivations or explanations whatsoever for the character's actions.  One minute, the small town girl played by Heather Graham is working at a nursing home, then she's downing alcohol, then she's jumping around naked for absolutely no apparent reason (in fact, she doesn't even seem drunk), and all this entices the character Colin Firth to jump into bed with her.  I think the Heather Graham character is supposed to be quirky, but because of the script and the way the film is cut, she comes off as schitsophrenic and unlikable.  Then suddenly they are in a serious relationship which Colin dives into wholeheartedly even though he is supposed to be recovering from a breakup with his fiance (and this is no rebound relationship).  Basically, the movie continues along this vein, with Minnie Driver showing up as the dark-haired British ex-fiance who you can't see ever having had a relationship with Colin (both actors are better in the much superior movie Circle of Friends).  In any case, there are many more unexplained actions and wierd breakups/get back togethers before the movie thankfully ends.      Additionally, the setting is completely misused, beginning with the sign that says more than 18,000 people live in Hope.  In New England, that does not classify as a small town.  They could have used the autumn setting and American-ness of the people as restorative to the Colin character.  The suggestion of that is there, but it is never demonstrated - instead, they go to a spot that is supposed to be nice and the Heather Graham character downs a bottle of booze, and Colin Firth's character has no real explanation or feeling in his portraits of the town's people.  Although the hotel owners are fun, if unrealistic, the mayor has been written as if he were a cartoon character.      Finally, I don't neccessarily blame the actors for this awful movie, with the wierd cutting, it may have seemed like a good idea at the time.  I think Colin Firth does his best at being an ambigious, but still likeable guy.  Heather Graham, aside from not coming off as a small town girl at all, has absolutely nothing to work with, so you can't even blame her for the horrendous character she has.  And everyone else, including Minnie Driver, is a complete caricature, although Minnie Driver incites some of the few amusing moments in the film.     I feel bad to judge this movie so harshly, but it is unneccessarily bad, and I had been hoping for something at least fun.  These actors all have much better movies out there. 
 I had high hopes for this DVD as I'm looking for good insightful information re 9/11, especially in relation to the collapse of Building 7. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed and really learned little from it. It is like a home movie in real time. Could be edited to a fraction of its length and not loose much. Yes, devastation was shown but that alone is not sufficient to make it worthwhile. Of course Steve Spak did not know WTC7 was going to collapse but one reviewer referred to the fires in it, as though there was significant information in the DVD about them. There is not. No hard feelings but I wasted my money 
 This machine definetely deserves a star is for its "heavy-duty" look. However, I am unable to judge further simply because my specimen broke down after the first crank. An inspection of its mechanical construction showed that it had not been designed for actual use but rather for kitchen decoration.. 
 Not enough thunder.  The long periods of rain sounded like static.  Dissappointing 
 This book disappointed me after reading Martins letters. Although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity. There are much better books on analysing companies I suggest Financial Statement Analysis by Martin Fridson and Fernando Alvarez. 
 The author takes the exact opposite approach of Ian M. Banks.  Where Banks writes in clean, understandable English and lets the power of his ideas shine through his writing, Wright cloaks his story behind long strings of almost meaningless words.  "Noumeal" instead of "mental", for example.  On top of this, the Author is Overly Fond of Using Capitals, which Lends a Presumptuous Air to his Work.  This gets Very Irritiating, Very Quickly.   As does his insistence on using very big numbers to lend a sense of grandiosity to the story.  Using big numbers was impressive in the days of Doc E. E. Smith and the Galactic Lensmen.  Nowdays it is just looks silly.  Some of the ideas in the book are interesting, perhaps even original.  However, they are inconsistently mixed in with anacronisms that make no sense in a futuristic context.  For example:  - Why does a society that is set in at least 5000AD (the protagonist is 3000 years old) still use the British legal system ?  There is a court scene replete with barristers and case refences (eg x vs. y).  - Why are there still fashions based on geography (eg European clothing fashion) when most of the story is based in a virtual world and independent of location?  - Why does time move *faster* in the real world than the virtual?  The main character decides to take a break from the virtual, and does so by unplugging.  He has time to walk around before returing, to find that all the independent entities in the virtual world was exactly as he left them.  If anything, the virutal world should move faster than the real world (due to processing power) and independent entities should not be "frozen" every time someone unplugs.  Perhaps answers to these questions appear later in the book.  I could only read a third of it before giving up- I simply find the inconsistencies and the prose too painful wade through to find out.  Nor am I by any means an overly picky reader- I am a voracious consumer of science fiction, and revel in anything from grand (Ian M. Banks, Peter Hamilton) to classic (Asimov) to cheesy space opera (McMaster Bujold) to boys-own-adventure (Timothy Zahn).  If you are considering buying this book, I'd suggest at least browsing some of the sample pages and not relying on the editorial review 
 Since none of the other reviews for this movie seem to focus on the Blu-Ray disc, I decided I'll throw my $.02 in.  The movie is a very good, well told story. The other reviews tell you that. What they don't tell you is that the Blu-Ray version is a waste of money.  The first issue I had when playing the movie was the menu. Something told me that when the menu come on and it looked no better than DVD that something was amiss. I had hoped it was just the menu. I was wrong.  I then started the movie up with subtitles and when the actual movie started I raised my hand to my head and began to scratch it. The video looked HORRIBLE. Pixelated and blurry and lacking detail.  I paused the movie just before the drum scene. I then put the DVD into my Oppo 971 DVD player, switched the input on my TV to the DVD player and skipped to the same scene on the DVD. I was amazed. The DVD upconverted to 720p using the Oppo 971 looked BETTER than the 1080p image coming from the PS3 through HDMI! The only difference is that the PS3's image is a bit brighter. This may be because I haven't calibrated the color for the HDMI input and not a true representation of the transfer.  The sound is really good, but not a whole lot better than the DVD. It certainly isn't worth the price to upgrade to Blu-Ray when the sound nearly imperceptibly changes and the video looks this bad.  Looking at reviews on-line for the disc and given they were giving the movie decent video ratings, I thought it may be a problem with my setup, so I called Sony's PS3 support line and basically was told that as long as my other movies looked good (Corpse Bride looks simply stunning in Blu-Ray) that it was likely the way the movie was authored. Pretty sad that Sony, who are the biggest backers of the format, can't even author a movie properly. I have since learned from sources other than people trying to justify the expense of their $1000 players that HoFD is widely regarded as Sony's most poorly authored Blu-Ray title. Part of the issue may also be that Sony has an aversion to VC-1 (which is supported by Microsoft) and instead focuses on using MPEG-2 to encode the video. Talledega Nights also uses MPEG-2 but looks light years beyond HoFD.  Do yourself a favor if you want to purchase this on Blu-Ray; save yourself some money and buy the DVD version instead. The content doesn't change and it honestly looks better than the Blu-Ray disc. If you want something to show off the clarity of Blu-Ray, pick up Corpse Bride 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 First let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail... He does not. He hikes less than a third. You dont find this out until 2/3 through the book, which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad, to an ill effort to fulfill a contract.   My conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher, could not, and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics.   As others have said in this review forum. This book can be snide, highschoolish and down right mean. I fail to see the "wit" in his endless negitivity and bashing.   This book has a few funny parts, but I cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events, and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments. It is so unbelievible in places, that you know you are on an imagined tangent.   Dont waste your money or time. I am so happy I bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale! 
 Why Warner Bros? You can't possibly need the money. Why bring this franchise back to life if you're not planning on giving it the justice it deserves?!? I knew the moment I saw the cover that this film wouldn't be worthy of the prior 2 installments, but decided to give it a chance anyway. Big mistake, absolutely nothing about this film works. You get a bunch of horrible stories that are supposed to be intertwined but wind up being nothing but a big train wreck instead. The stories themselves don't make any sense in the first place. They just leave you baffled in the end; & not in a good mysterious way, just WTF? For example, the first story involves a girl & her family. The father has just gotten some new universal remote that whenever he press's buttons the family (all except for the girl) change nationalities. Whenever this happens a chunk of the girl's body becomes all grossly disfigured & mutated. The movie never explains why or where (well I guess later in the movie it kinda explains where, kinda) the father got the remote, why the remote did what it did, or why the girl wasn't affected? This may not seem like a big deal, but once you watch the movie believe me it does, & the whole movie is like that. It's nothing but a bunch of inconsistent amateurish plotlines all mashed together to form one big horrible movie. Another thing about the movie is that it draaaaaaaaaaaaags on. Not necessarily due to the subject matter, but instead the pacing. You can tell this director is pure amateur hour. There's one scene in particular that comes to mind involving this lame mad scientists zany prank flashbacks. This scene went on, & on, & on, & on, just absolutely forever. Stuff like that plagues the movie from beginning to end. Anyway, nothing about the movie works, the acting is horrendous, bad effects (a combo of cartoony CGI & what looks like bright red watery corn syrup), & the story as I said before is lame; there's just nothing good to say about the movie. In addition, the gypsy with the crystal ball you see on the fancy drawn up cover, doesn't show up until the very, very, very end right before the credits role having absolutely nothing to do with the movie what so ever. This is not an homage, but rather a complete insult to all the original greats involved such as King, Romero & Savini. Stay away from this garbage at all costs 
 Found recipes dated, layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how-to is useful, its generally from another era. Bought Gourmet cook book instead 
 I used to have this same unit under the brand name "Emerson Research"  It's a pretty good unit, but it's a very old model.  For the price, you can get a much more modern one from Emerson Research at a local store 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 I found History of the Balkans very flat as I have a interest in former Yugoslavia.Mr Glenny pasted over English created problems ie:Blieburg, he would have you believe happened as a Partisan only action against Women ,Children & Ustashe members.He should cover one Country rather than try cram the whole region into one book 
 American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs 
 "Psychic Cat" has a nice story behind it - singer Kelli Ali leaves the Sneaker Pimps, goes on the dole, does soul-searching and travels for a while, eventually recording a solo album.  While recording the album, she meets a Santa Monica street performer with a pair of psychic cats - hence, this album's title.  Unfortunately, Ali's second solo effort is a bland electro-pop affair, falling somewhere between Avril Lavigne and Depeche Mode.  Her voice is largely wasted on prosaic lyrics and safe production that connotes rather than conveys attitude.  Pro Tools may make a singer, but it can also break one 
 This book truely does not help much.  The problems at the end of the chapters do not have any answers in the back of the book, as do all others.  It is impossible to check your work until it is too late.  This book does not build from simpler to more complex.  It does the opposite, which only prolongs the learning process and makes it more difficult than it could be 
 I have been charged however I did not get a copy of the policy to date. 
 If you are beginning CMOS analog design,please dont use this.There is very brief theory to supplement and equally insufficient physical explanations;maybe for an experienced industry guy this sort of approach works well,but in all this is not the text to follow.It has obvious advantages since a website with solutions is devoted to the text but that in no way compensates for the poor quality of material-it is very difficult to develop physical understanding out of this book.Maybe using Alan Gerbene's text (MOS Analog Design)alongside this book will help,I adopted this approach and it helped 
 There do seem to be a lot of people who have been helped by this book, and it is hard to argue with that.  But there is something about a person whose problems are not super-big writing a book telling those of us whose problems ARE super-big how we are doing things wrong.  The author is telling me that my thoughts are the cause of my difficulties and nothing else.  I am guilty of "distorted" thinking.  Oh, dear!  Surely I should want to correct my "distortions"!    Frankly, I don't believe my thinking is distorted at all!  I also believe many people are unhappy for some pretty legitimate reasons, and that we shouldn't try and "correct" them unless we have lived in their shoes!  Many people will buy this book willingly and benefit, but at least a few will have it shoved in their face and be told "now get happy or else!"  For those people, I have the greatest sympathy.  For anyone who thinks that maybe we are all being brainwashed into believeing that everyone can be happy simply by changing their thoughts, I would suggest reading Steve Salerno's book "SHAM: How the self-help industry made America Helpless". For anyone else, I would recommend it anyway.  Even if you don't like his point of view, at least you'll learn a few interesting tidbits 
 The books are in fine condition.  My problem is with Amazon! I will never buy text books on Amazon again!  Waited over 2 months for the books that were promised within 10 days.  Not just one book, but 5 out of 8 that I ordered. Never, Never again! 
 I ordered The DVD "Jackie Chan 3-Pack" [DVD] only because it was supposed to include the movie "Drunken Master", a real classic I have been on the  lookout ever since I got into DVDs. The "Jackie Chan 3-Pack" are 3 DVDs handsomely packed and the  discs themselves are attractively overprinted, but alas, even though in one place "Drunken Master" is mentioned, it is not in  this pack. What the pack really includes are three DVDs of the worst quality imaginable!!! Even worse than than a 4 time re-recorded Video tape movie re-recorded on some inferior quality tape!!! My disappointment was replaced by a feeling of insult and and I was  overcome by the impulse to quietly discard these DVDs deep down at the bottom of the garbage can. Actually I took a chance ordering these DVDs because nowhere was there any information about them on the web only the vague mentioning of the "drunken Master" as being one of the pack. Which of course it is not!!! Now maybe other Jackie Chan fans will know better 
 Concur w/ others that this is a short story masquerading as a book.  Making matters worse is a protagonist who, if he did anything other than compound chemicals, the reader gets no sense of it.  Either a cleverly disguised interesting individual or yet another fantastically dull Victorian.  The book is poorly organized to boot, w/ attempts at being current falling very flat.  Disappointing book - not the author's best 
 Richard Pryor is my all-time favorite stand-up comedian.  I consider him the best in the business.  But his performance in  "Live and Smokin" shows he's still just a rookie.  He's nervous in front of the camera, and says so several times. His material   is typically raunchy, but not very funny. You can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience. Buy this tape only if you're a die-hard Pryor fan, but don't expect the side-splitting laughter you'll get from "In Concert", "Live on the Sunset Strip", and "Here and Now" 
 I bought this CD because I like Carly's voice but was dissapointed with the song selection, it seemed like I was listenning to a CD of nursery rhymmes. However the music arrangements were good. Very dissapointed and threw the CD in the bin 
 Office 2007 may seem ok at first.  The menus are all ok for me to use, so I don't have to build menus from scratch.  But after installing the trial, I found numerous complaints that would make me want to trash it if I had it.  1)  Word doesn't want to integrate with Outlook very well 2)  Everytime I want to send a mail message I accidentally click on 'Paste' 3)  The flags and categories for Outlook are annoying and just add to the time spent administering email without helping me more than Outlook 2003 4)  Along with all of the other Microsoft products I've tried in the past month, it hangs, corrupts its own files, and generally takes up too much memory.  I'll stick with Office 2003, which doesn't have nearly as many flaws.  There is no reason for me to upgrade.  I'm also back to IE6, Money 2006, and will not upgrade to Vista.  I've lost volumes of emails because I can't downgrade my Outlook files.  Good Job in alienating your customers, Microsoft.  (so what's new? 
 This book is really really horrible. It took me a while but I finally finished it hoping it would get better.....it didn't. I was disappointed in the book after having read and enjoyed the 'ware series and Hacker and the Ants. My advice is don't bother 
 I had read this book many years ago and enjoyed it. The book was written 100 years ago, but does hold some truths of the world today. However, it appears to be a reproduction, the book was rather expensive for what I got - a slim paper back full of typo' 
 I love Modest Mouse, really I do, though maybe not anymore. This marks the third time I've been completely disappointed by the newest release from a band that I thought could do no wrong. First it was Depeche Mode's Exciter album, then I get totally blind sided by the complete turd that was The Cure's latest self titled album (glad I never got that Cure tattoo I always wanted) now Modest Mouse Too??? What's going on here, are previously great bands conspiring to release uninspired tripe now? I, like everyone else on the planet, was overjoyed when I heard that Johnny Marr would be contributing heavily to this album and had indeed become and official member of Modest Mouse.... oh, I give up, there's nothing else I really want to say about this Frankenstein's Monster running amuck in downtown Tokyo. Want a good Modest Mouse album? Pick up Moon and Antarctica instead 
 This album contains a lot of experimental music, with a few early Talking Heads type songs sprinkled in.  If you like Brian Eno's experimental music, you will like this album 
 The compass is wholly unreliable.  The light button turns on in your bag, thus draining the battery.  One of my worst Amazon purchases 
 I'm a HUGE Sinatra fan, but this is a weak brew.  Sinatra phones it in (literally - he wasn't even in the same room with his duet partners), and few of the guests offer anything of value.  This is a marketing ploy, not an album - get any of the great Capitol releases from the 50s and learn why Sinatra was the Entertainer of the Century.. 
 I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...  Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife. 
 Maybe at the time it was written I would have reviewed it more favorably. In light of the life Miller led I can't help but to be disappointed by the cheap commericialization of the socialist superiority over capitalist theme that permeates the play. Here Miller creates a character only to destroy that character to point out the ills of capitalism, then Miller spends the rest of his life living an indulgent capitalist life here in the good ole USA: the very capitalist society that was supposedly Willy's oppressor. I think the years have taken the shine off of Miller a bit. I'm sure the Liberal 101 literature professor will disagree 
 One of the charging bays always indicates that the batteries in the bay are not in working condition.  I'm also getting unusual behavior from the other indicators.    I tried the 15-minute Energizer charger, and I'm having problems with this unit as well (see my review for that charger).  Frankly, I'm done wasting my time with Energizer chargers now.  I've never had these types of problems with other chargers in the past. 
 I have to admit, I bought this book based upon its title alone.  After breastfeeding continuously for over seven years, I really wanted to read a good, funny book about a nursing mother.  However, I kept feeling that Lisa Shapiro was trying, really hard to be funny, but just kept missing the mark.  I was prepared for the fact that the book might not be factually correct ( it isn't ), I was just hoping for funny.  If you're looking for funny AND factually correct, I'd really recommend, "So THAT's What They're For!: Breastfeeding Basics" by Janet Tamaro 
 Shucks, I was hopin' for so much more.  This book is just too sanitary for me.  This gal has been around and seen a lot more than she talks about, and I am not talkin' jest sex here. This  woman has more talent than half of Hollywood put together.  She is a  hurricane, but she comes off like a mouse in this tome.  She is the most  beautiful woman in the world over 50, I am sure of it, both inside and out.   I'll wait 'til she's 80 and writes her REAL memoirs.  Dolly, you have the  greatest lips in the world 
 So much detail, so many acronyms, too much technical detail and rhetoric, not much action.   Bill Kurry 
 This video tape works, but it is basically a clip of people doing a different exercise each, all pasted together to make a full workout.  I still think the moves work, but I'd rather follow along with someone doing a full workout with me 
 Someone please slap me because I BOUGHT this movie at my local grocery store thinking that it was going to be a documentary or something.  In reality, this was not even a B movie... is there such thing as an "F" movie.  I do not think real film was used to for this movie... just cheap Beta tapes and a video camera 1981.  Furthermore, the only accurate "fact" in this movie was the name of the killer.  Dear Ulli, BTK did NOT carry around a picnic basket full of scorpions, tarantulas and rats to the crime scenes.  And when the "Nancy" character said "I know you... You're the dog catcher" I thought I was about to fall off my seat.  Dear lord in heaven, please do not rent, buy, borrow or steal this pathetic movie.  The fact that it was completely inaccurate, looked like it had been filmed by a 12-year old and contained non-sensical, gratuitous violence should be reason enough to stay far, far, far away from this piece of crap 
 I skimmed John Gray's "Practical Miracles for Mars & Venus," but couldn't stomach the hype.  The first 150 pages are about the power of positive thinking and of belief in miracles.  (Gray claims that the world has matured to the point that miracles are now available to anyone, at any time.  Democracy and religious tolerance are two of the enabling changes.)  Gray then sketches some simple techniques for physical and emotional healing: eat right; breath deeply; use a Chi Gong exercise to "recharge healing energy" and "decharge excess or negative energy" (or stress and negative thoughts); imagine that people have treated you better than they actually did; write yourself a letter expressing your frustrations; cultivate gratitude, confidence, joy, etc.; envision the world you want; believe in yourself and your power to heal.  I gather that the techniques are more completely described in Gray's "How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have."  "Practical Miracles" reads like an ad for Gray's seminars, or like a verbatim trancript of a stage presentation.  (On page 239 he says "Now I have written twelve bestsellers and tend to be a speed writer. ... After many years of developing my thoughts, it takes me only a few months to write them down and create a book.")  Positive thinking is all well and good, but the seminar must be more inspiring than the book 
 I work at Monte Sano State Park and when I compared the section about the "Plateau Loop Trail" (also known as the North Plateau Loop and South Plateau Loop) with our trail map (which is not, as is stated in the book, 50 cents, but $2.00 because it is a very detailed and excellent map) I saw numerous mistakes.  Firstly, only a very fast and experienced hiker could do the entire trail in an hour.  I can do the North Plateau Loop in 40 minutes, but that is at a fast pace, and it is only 1.2 miles, whereas the entire loop is about 4.8 miles.  Also, hiking is not free at the park.  There is an admission fee for all hikers, bikers and picnickers.  One of the "ruins" the author describes is the site of a lodge built several years ago, which is used for meetings and events.  Some of the landmarks and cross-trails he describes are not correct, and he doesn't even mention where the North Plateau Loop crosses the road that leads into the park! Someone unfamiliar with that trail would have difficulty picking it up on the other side of the road, as it is not easy to see. He also has the Bog Trail meet up with the South Plateau Loop twice before it meets with the Mountain Mist Trail, where it actually meets it the second time after the intersection of the Mountain Mist Trail.  There are so many mistakes in this one trail description that I wonder how many other trail descriptions are in error.  As far as Monte Sano State Park goes, we have twenty miles of hiking and/or biking trails, and your best bet would be to come to the park and purchase one of our trail maps, and if possible talk to one of the rangers, who are extremely knowledgable about the park trails.  And a $2.00 accurate map is certainly better than an inaccurate $13.00 book 
 Joy's book reflects the comedy I see from her on TV. This book is very cute and entertaining. A fun read 
 LUCKY FOR ME I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS PUMP BUT THE HOSPITAL GAVE IT TO ME. I COULD ONLY GET TWO DROPS OF MILK FOR EVERY TEN PUMPS. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. YOU WOULD FIGURE THE HOSPITAL WOULD KNOW IF THE PUMP WORKED 
 I'm a big fan of Asher's polity novels, but I didn't find Africa Zero nearly as interesting.  This work seems to be mostly an expression of the author's political views, which are approximately those of the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front.  The hero of the novel, we are told, was responsible for saving the Earth by culling the human population with genetically designed diseases and preditors -- an idea that has emerged in some factions of the British animal rights movement.  In other words, he murdered billions of people for ideological reasons, and we are supposed to think he is cool.  I have to say, I will be harder for me to enjoy Asher's books after seeing how naive, hostile and anti-American his views are.  
 This book is remarkable in one way--it accurately represents the fantasies of many a teenage girl.  Yes, Jim really sang to YOU, even encoding special messages in his songs. ("If I WERE to say to you..." in the Ed Sullivan Show is actually a response to Ashcroft's grammar critique, who knew?) Yes, this 20-something man was entralled both intellectually and physically by a nerdy (by her own account) teenager and what he really wanted to do was trade not particularly high brow literary analogies for hours on end.  Yes, you were the only one who truly grasped the meaning of the Doors.  And this goes on for hundreds of pages.  Towards the end, I began to worry seriously about Ashcroft's mental state.   This book adequately represents the fantasy life of the pubescent, but, alas, is no more true than my high school fantasies.  And not only does it have teenager appropriate content, it also has a writing style that could have been lifted verbatim from my overwrought high school diaries.  
 I ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices (all had the same description and specs).  It worked for about 2 weeks, and then quit.  A friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette, which had come loose. Since then it has come loose twice more, so I just don't use it anymore.  When it worked, it worked fine, but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution 
 I have read and enjoyed many Cussler books, and though this one was mildly entertaining it was way out there as far the plot goes. If you haven't read Cussler before don't let this be your first, there are many more that are much better 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 After two weeks on this diet plan I could bearly lift my head up.  I nearly fell asleep driving home from work nights...not to mention hardly staying awake while at work.  I thought it would be a pleasant change from the restrictions of Atkins, but I was never tired on Atkins.  I don't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs...or what the problem was.  All I know is I am happily following Atkins and losing much more rapidly than I did on this CAD plan.  In two weeks I lost 6 lbs. on CAD...14 on Atkins.  You figure it out 
 I don't know anyone would like to read this book unless they are Afrian Americans. In "How Capatalism Underdeveloped Black America," the author writes the only way to achieve economic, political and social development for Blacks is to overthrow Captalist system in United States. As the author said, since the country is dominated by racist, and sexist white Americans, a bloody revolution has to be acted. The first phase of the socialist revolution is voting for progressive and anticapitalist politicians. The second phase is creating a chaotic living condition in America so that government has to cooperate with revoluntists. After the success of the socialist reforms, and totally eliminated captalism in the nation. They are going to support other countries to achieve "equality", too. Our country is going to be working class based nation, with universal health care, volunteer military officers, and equal-paid wage. 
 I totally agree with the other reviewers that when it comes to Canadian rock, most of the choice tracks are left out in favour of commercial pap. While "Lay it on the Line" has to be the biggest power rock song of all time from a three man group there are sadly,  a lot of omissions. In addition to the ones mentioned I would also include "Young Enough to Cry" from the "Just a Game" album. A better blues guitar song you will never hear, at least not on this compilation. 
 This book makes a lot of assumptions.  It assumes that the reader is EXTREMELY well versed in corporate tax advantages.  It assumes that the reader already owns a corporation.  It assumes that the book will be read with a dictionary of financial terms close at hand.  (It should be.  The book is poorly written, with key terms lacking adequate defenition.)  I support the Rich Dad series.  It is a great way for a beginner to get their feet wet.  This book assumes that the reader can already swim!  Even the seasoned incorporator would probably not be pleased with this book.  Tell you what, if you are considering buying this book, save yourself some money and just send me ten bucks.  I'll then call you (on my own dime) and summarize the book for you.  Oh, what the heck, I'll do it now, for free...surround yourself with a competent team of advisors 
 I picked up this book as it looked like some nice light reading to fill in some aspects of eastern religion unfamiliar to me.   Perhaps I'm spoiled by reading books by actual participants in a religion, but even an external observer should be able to provide more insight than is found here. I confess to having read only the Buddhist sections, but they were so misguided and innacurate I won't be reading more.   The author seems to be disinterested and even have disdain for the subject. Perhaps in an attemempt to be user-friendly, the book has an undertone of humor, but unfortunately it all has a negative tone.  If you have never read a book on eastern religion before, this would not be a good first step, in my opinion 
 Green Day is the most over-rated band that is in modern music. Here is the main reason that I get so angered by fans of Green Day. For some reason, some Green Day fan comes writes a review for a Metal album, and says Green Day is so much better, or this is music junk, Billy Joe or is a much better singer. SO know its my turn to tell it like it is. Green Day isnt that good, as its grown men that still act like boys and wear makeup, since half their listeners are in the 13-18 age range.Its OK to listen to what you want to, but please stop praising this band as musical gods. If you like them, thats great, but a couple so simple guitar riffs and some la de da singing dont impress me enough to put them as musical Gods. I will give them credit. They survived the Grunge age and are still going strong, as most bands during that era have faded into obscurity. If you are looking for some music that is Green Day type, go out and get some Clash, Ramones, or Sex Pistols. Its a lot deeper, less poppy, and stood for something. It also had alot more creativity, as most punk bands from the 70's and 80's were, since the musical genere was new, and the bands that I mentioned created it 
 Thought that this would actually be a novel about his writing of the novels.  Returned the book and the service was great.  
 I was thoroughly impressed with Mr. Buchanan's witty prose and charming dilect. He is obviously skilled in "spinning a good yarn" for his audience. The dangerous thing about this book is that it provides a platform for all who subscribe to the idea that patriotism and nationalism are one and the same. For instance, I love my country but I think nationalism leads to racism and oppression of other cultures. America is great because of the people that live here and the freedoms we enjoy. It is not great because we have imperialistic attituedes around the globe and enjoy our capitalistic greed. Those are not requirements of our country only offshoots of our ego's. Democracy is what we are founded on, not capitalism (in my opinion). Freedom must be enjoyed by all, not just the rich elite. Someday their will be an uprising of the lower class and people like Buchanan will be the instigators. People that have everything, yet demonize those who are trying to get their voice heard by any means necessary are only showing their ignorance. How did the anglo-whites get the power in this country, by taking it rudely and loudly. That is what minorities in this country need to do - speak loudly and make the country hear their voices. Just like whites have done for centuries 
  This story was about a boy named Robin who could not move his legs at all. His mom went to go see the Queen and his father was fighting the Scots in the North. While they were gone he stayed with a lady named Dame Ellen. One day she left and did not come back so a monk took him to a hospice. He wrote a letter to his father to meet him at Castle Lindsey. They met each other and soon his mom came home, by then it was Christmas time. They lived happily ever after.    I would give this book 2 stars because it did not hold my attenttion at all.   I did not like this book at all it did not hold my attention.                                                                                                                             
 This book, in my opinion, does not have a lot to offer. Essentially it is an alleged 1655 edition of the Heptameron with detailed commentary on how to perform the ceremony.   The chapters that come before contain a ridiculously stupid version of history leading up to the present time (which isn't surprising since most occult books have a ludicrous view of history); passioned and arrogant statements about how "Modern Era Magick" supposedly doesn't work because of the hippie mentality; lists of "axioms" the author deems to be true; the constant warning that the practitioner of magic needs to do everything EXACTLY as it appears in a magic grimore or it will fail/make the practioner sorry.  Although some points Lisiewski points out I agree with, especially how lax modern practioners have become, there is so much other baggage in this book that it is difficult for me to recommend 
 Ha ha ha.  Okay, okay, I never even watched the movie.  i just wanted to type that, but if it is anything like Leprechaun, then it sucks and I was right 
 I had bought this product as a gift, therefore can't return it. Before buying the product, I did alot of reading and was lead to believe that these were the actual bowl games. However, there is not a full lenght game in the bunch. It is only a narrator telling you what football is and decribing what they call "highlites" of the games...believe me it was a total disappointment. If you want to see the actual bowl games, you won't see them on this set...you will, however, see some old film clips of interviews with fans and the famous personallities of the time.  
 This movie was boring, it was like one of those sundance films, interesting enough to watch once, then put it away forever. The best part of the movie was Halle Berry's sex scene's they were brief, and tastfully done, however if it wasn't for her I never would have watched it. If I ever watch it again, it will be to get my Halle Berry fix......Keit 
 The books are in fine condition.  My problem is with Amazon! I will never buy text books on Amazon again!  Waited over 2 months for the books that were promised within 10 days.  Not just one book, but 5 out of 8 that I ordered. Never, Never again! 
 This book, simply put, is boring. I would have thought that the creator of the entire Forgotten Realms universe could come up with great stories, it seems I was wrong. Overall, Greenwood's writing is dull, and rarely kept me interested in any aspect of the story.   Let's start with the characters. Firt off, you have Elminster, who, being the main character, you'd hope to be interesting or remarkable in some way. Sadly, he doesn't live up to any of these expectations, he is boring, the only remarkable aspect being his godly and unrealistic power, which he gains with little effort. Now that he's out of the way, you have every other minor character, which Greenwood fails to flesh out, as well. I must say, there's nothing more annoying than having to flip back 100 or so pages because the author expects you to remember a minor character, yet he/she wasn't interesting enough to care about in the first place. Unfortunately, this happens multiple times in the book.  The story, while hackneyed, is what gives this book 2 stars instead of 1. I believe that the story was boring, sadly, but had the potential to be better. We, as readers, could have done without the unbearable amount of clichés and points where it feels like chapters upon chapters of the book were torn out. On top of that, many scenes were dragged out, as if the author were frantically trying to think of what to wirter next, and letting whatever popped into his head flow from his fingers. I guess the main positive thing about the story was that it had some decent twists and turns, nothing, save for the overall fate of our main character, was all that predicatable.  I just don't know what to say... reading this book was not a fun experience, every chapter just seemed like another mountain to climb, yet there was no satisfaction when reaching the top. I just could not bring myself to like this book, and finishing it seemed like a chore, rather than a pleasure.  All in all, I would not recommend this book, and while it is not exactly *terrible*, it's just not worth your time to read. 
 I really wanted to read this book.  I've read a lot about the Nazi persecution of Jews, as well as their persecution of Russians, Slavs, homosexuals, anarchists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and so on.  But I hadn't read much about their persecution of the Roma, or Gypsies, and I wanted to learn about it. But the book is extraordinarily dry.  The author did not bring the events to life at all. It's pretty hard to make a subject as inherently dramatic as the systematic persecution of an entire people not very interesting, but the author succeeded.  What's worse, really, was that as other reviewers suggested, there was a powerful theme of underplaying the importance of what happened to the Roma. I was very disturbed by this. I give the book two stars instead of one because I did learn a few things. But I will be looking for another book on the subject, because I didn't learn enough 
 Caveat - I wasn't exactly expecting to finish PE a die-hard believer.  That said, I was unprepared for how much of my skepticism stemmed from the authors' willingness to believe anything, and mask their suspension of disbelief as objectivity.  According to legend, the US Navy conducted invisibility experiments on one of their ships during WWII.  Not simply invisible, the ship actually teleported from its berth in Philadelphia.  However, the little-understood process played havoc with the crew - even after the experiment's end, some crewmen would "blink" in and out of existence, become frozen in time or catch fire.  One man walked through a wall, never to be seen again.  Of course, the Navy denies the whole thing....  While the legend places the story during the dark days of WWII, the legend itself began in the mid 1950's, with the publication of "The Case for the UFO" by Morris Jessup.  (Aknowledging that Jessup is no scientist, Berlitz & Moore nevertheless refer to him as "Dr. Jessup".)  Believing that propulsion of UFO's (and perhaps future human spacecraft) lay in solving Einstein's "Unified Field Theory", Jessup encouraged readers to press for research in that area. Jessup's book caught the attention of Carl Allen (AKA Carlos Allende), who spent the war in the Merchant Marine.  In a series of rambling letters Allen insisted that Einstein had solved UFT, and the solution was successfully used to cloak a USN warship in wartime experiments.  Though claiming to have witnessed the event from deck of a nearby freighter, Allen goes further than detailing his observation - exhaustively describing the travails of the crew, Einstein's seeming retraction of UFT, his admission to Bertrand Russel that UFT was complete but had to be suppressed at least until after WWIII, the identity of one of the chief scientists attached to the project, and that UFT had anything to do with the experiment.  To get his point across, Allen/Allende even forwarded a copy of Jessup's book (heavily annotated with his own theories, many having nothing to do with the Philadelphia Experiment) to the Office of Naval Research.  There it piqued the personal interest of at least 2 officers, and slowly became the story-that-wouldn't-die.  A few years later, a depressed Jessup was found dead in his car.  Allende/Allen became something of a cult celeb, sometimes retracting what he had previously claimed, often warning against the ominous dangers of UFT even as he seemed to beg others to look into it.  Berlitz and Moore piece Allen/Allende together with what are supposed to be other pieces of a puzzle that will prove the Philadelphia Experiment actually occurred.  Instead, the result is far less than the sum of its parts: Berlitz and Moore place far more weight on any of the individual pieces than common sense would allow, and they find a better fit between the different pieces than you'd get in a jigsaw puzzle.  Nothing in PE lacks a more reasonable explanation than the authors can provide.  At the beginning, and towards the end of the book, the authors mention coming in contact with others who claim to have met alleged crewmembers of the ship involved in the experiment - but neither name nor any other convincing corroborating information comes out (Allende at least included his Merchant Marine ID in his letters).  The authors add to the puzzle, but never actually establish that the Philadelphia Experiment actually occurred.  An anonymous radar scientist, who doesn't claim to have worked on the project, clairifies how events would have had to occurr if the legend were true.  Another scientist - given a psuedonym because it would upset "the status quo" - describes wartime discussions on a project that we're supposed to believe developed into the Philadelphia Experiment.  Named "Rinehart" after a similar character in the novel "Thin Air" (a thriller inspired by the legend) the doctor describes discussions but never mentions witnessing the experiment, nor any discussions of its aftermath - obvious details for such a pivotal figure.  "Rinehart" never even mentions Allende, even though it had been Allende's letters that clued the authors into Rinehart's existence (under yet another pseudonym).  The authors never explain how they managed to find "Rinehart" - they need to protect his identity even though the government obviously knows who he is, and anybody else would have the same difficulty tracking him down as the authors of this book.  The authors describe how the experiments of another scientist in "electrogravity" never caught on despite their apparent success - suggesting they were suppressed.  Though Allende described reading stories about the Experiment's sailors in Philadelphia newspapers, the only article that could be found is obviously bogus: a xerox of an obviously fabricated article describing a bar-room brawl by sailors who mysteriously vanish -  but no mention of date, newspaper, or the reporter, nor any specific facts in the article about the event, like the name of the bar or those of witnesses.  The authors make the barest efforts to answer the questions they raise, and then merely add more pieces to the puzzle, without explaining how one piece corroborates any others.  Though appearing critical and objective, it's impossible to believe that the authors haven't already settled on the idea that the experiment actually occurred - they explicitly question Allende, yet never express their doubts, let alone attempt to deal with our own.   But what's the danger of that?  I mean, who cares if they can get their readers to believe the legend of the "Philadelphia Experiment".  Unfortunately, "Philadelphia" feeds on our prejudices of secret conspiracies, and relies on our willingness to do so with little prompting - never a positive thing.  Worse, it's not even interesting - barely substantive enough to raise the sort of questions that would make a more critical investigation a stirring story. 
 Most of the allegations made in this book, usually by rightwing mudslingers rather than leftwing ones, are old smears and distortions which have been disproven by responsible journalists (sadly, a disappearing breed.) Consider the source: Alexander Cockburn is an arrogant 'cocktail party vanguard' fake leftist who's best known for wacko conspiracy theories and vicious personal attacks 
 The two foundations of the novel are plot and characterisation. "The Master and Margarita" lacks both. It comprises an over-long series of tenuously connected but essentially discrete incidents of a monotonously bizarre nature, like a not very good joke endlessly repeated with slight variations. Furthermore, the "hero", i.e. "the master", doesn't appear until halfway though and reappears only intermittently. It's not surprising that the novel becomes tedious very quickly.  Turning to the characters, they are all of a piece: shallow-minded time-servers with a penchant for hysterics. They are as two-dimensional as any cartoon character, and as fundamentally uninteresting.  Scene-setting is all but non-existent except, curiously, in the Pontius Pilate sections. This is a great pity since Moscow at the height of Stalin's terror should be a gift for a novelist.  This sort of slapstick fantasy with pretensions probably appeals to adolescents and academics, but there's not much in it for the grown-ups.  That said and despite its grievous faults, there are things in "The Master and Margarita" which suggest that Bulgakov had the makings of a real writer. Sadly his talent was smothered by the oppressive conditions under which it struggled to be born. Two stars, then, for what might have been 
 I have an epson cx4600, which on the surface looks to be a bargain, at $80. But the ink costs $60 to replace (3 colors and black) and the black, which I use mostly, costs twice the color ink.  But here's the real jab, I don't print too much and the ink got clogged some. It says to clean the print heads, and then print a test pattern. Well, the test pattern did not show completely clean, and so I repeated it 5 times. Then to my horror, I saw that each cleaning cleans ALL cartriges, and after the 5 cleanings, I was down to 50% ink. They don't have a way to clean just the black cartrige (or a specific color). I tried faking it out by saying i was replacing the ink in one cartrige (pull the black out and then back in) and it almost got the thing unclogged, but on the second try at this it got worse.   Bottom line, they give away the printers then get you by selling you high priced ink. The size of the cartrige is miniscule and I think you could probably only get about 20-30 full page images printed for about $50-60 worth of ink 
 This is the third film in the "Ginger Trilogy", featuring Cheri Cafarro as Ginger, "the female James Bond".  Ginger is once again called upon to offer her body for her country, as she goes up against  Ronnie St. Clair, the Anti-Ginger, a woman who similarly has no  compunctions about using her sexuality to get what she wants - in this  case, kidnapping two diplomats to milk an upcoming trade agreement for lots  and lots of money.  The Ginger movies would never be made today - these  Politically Correct times would never allow it - but this, the last and  most expensive of the three, concentrates more on the plot than the gleeful  sleazery of the first two films, making it less of a successful Ginger film  and more of a failed spy movie.  The first two, "Ginger" and  "The Abductors", are better examples of early 70's drive-in  sexploitation 
 This has not aged well. The scripts are silly, the acting is of the "chewing up the scenery" variety. Gale Storm no longer seems cute; she comes across as annoyingly perky. Spend your money on something else 
 Unless you think it's funny to watch a grown man scream at little children for an entire movie, I wouldn't recommend this 
 Rice paper crumbles off-- possible due to product being very old or improperly stored. Disappointing 
 I've picked stuff outta my nose after a long ride which contained more character and advice than this claptrap.  1 star because "No Stars" was not an option .. 
 this book was mildly funny but very juvenile... more of a gag gift sort of book than a hysterical read... i found it boring after the billionth f-bomb.. 
 I had what was supposed to be the same model for many years and it worked very well, although the push-down handle broke off two years ago.  The toaster finally became stuck in reheat mode, so I decided to replace it with the same model.  Not possible.  The newer incarnation of the Classic is much less sturdy and the push-down mechanism would not engage - that is, you could not push the handle down and have it stay down to toast.  I returned it and set out to find a better toaster - no easy task.  
 This is a very short book, with a dramatic message. On the surface, it looks like an attempt to convince US voters that 9/11 was just the beginning of their problems. Quoting bin Laden 'videos', Williams convincingly claims Osama bin Laden wants non-Muslims dead and has nuclear bombs to accomplish that goal. The fear factor is very high.   After more reflection, the book reminds me of a blackmail note. Just as a blackmailer, Williams attacks the American reader's self-confidence at every opportunity. Mr. bin Laden is super-human, while the American government weak and corrupt. Osama knows all our weaknesses, and solves problems beyond our skills. For the poor people of Afghanistan, he build hospitals, roads and shelters. He sells heroin to Europe and America, but his puritanical comrades avoid the stuff themselves. The Afghan heroin funds his nuclear projects and simultaneously undermines the western will. In contrast, the stupid American generals run up and down the mountain sides looking for Osama in all the wrong places. The corrupt US government has turned Pakistani and Afghan friendship into a deep seated hate for all things American. Defended by the billions of Osama loving Muslims around the world, it is obvious the US Army can never catch him. Offering the reader a measure of pity, Williams provides instructions on converting to Islam.   This sort of paper thin caricature does nothing to educate and much to demoralize.     It is probably best to act as if Osama has nukes in America, but I don't think it is a reality. Osama's nuclear attack is only believable if 1) the bombs were available for purchase, 2) are now in the US and 3) still work. Even with the plutonium, obtaining active tritium gas would be very difficult. Keeping them refreshed with tritium gas is not easy; it leaks, gets absorbed and decays. Still a few fresh ones may be around. On the other hand, a variety of reports suggest similar economic damage can be done with a few suicide bombs set off at key gas and electrical nodes around the US. If one wants to catalog the catastrophic, nuclear briefcases are not the worst or most likely. In short, Osama doesn't need a nuke, except perhaps for the media carnival that would follow. And, the media would make a killing on the event. Imagine the network anchors crawling around the rubble and think about how long they would smirk about the disaster.  As I write in early 2005, the panic over Osama-nukes is about a year old, and has faded from the foreground of media coverage. That panic, probably part of the US political campaign cycle, is the source from which the book emerges. Wondering who Mr. Williams might be and what motivates him, I checked for other titles he has penned: The Vatican Exposed: Money, Murder, and the Mafia (May 1, 2003)  Al-Qaeda : Brotherhood of Terror (February 8, 2002) The Complete Idiot's Guide(R) to the Crusades (October 18, 2001) The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Lives of the Saints (June 26, 2001)   Mr. Williams has a Ph.D. in historical theology and served as professor of Catholic theology and patristics (study of lives of Church Fathers) at two Catholic Universities. Despite the dust-cover claims, this isn't really the background of a journalist or FBI consultant. Perhaps the stress of writing 'lives of the saints' for 'idiots' was too much for him 
 I've been a designer for 5 years now, so the basic information this book gave about the different design specialties that have color specialists was not news to me.  It is such basic information, I think it might be geared toward high schoolers trying to pick a career or college major, or else it's geared toward people who are in a completely different field who know nothing about design professions.  In short, it did not help me to know what I can do to get from being a space planner/designer to a color specialist/designer 
 This camera took some great pictures, and I enjoyed it's size and functionality for several months.  I was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when I was passing it to a friend who was also seated.  The camera fell about 2 feet onto soft grass.  THE END.  The lens assembly is shot, according to my local camera store, not economical to fix.  This was about the softest fall a camera could take, and not work, it was like landing on a pillow.  I will not buy HP cameras again 
 While musically James McMurtry has talent, the message of his album and especially the hit song "We Can't Make It Here"  is outdated and unrealistic. In the song McMurtry laments about shirts being made in Singapore and the problems of outsourcing jobs, among other ridiculous things. It seems he would like to live in the world of the 1950s. While appealing on the surface, it is a waste of time to think like this.   McMurtry should realize that oursourcing is a reality and American companies have no choice. Nor is this a new issue. Shirts being made in Singapore? Give me a break -- he should find a real cause to wail against, not one that was lost years ago 
 I don't know if the problem with this book lies in the original author or in Thomas Cleary's translation. At any rate, "Awakening to the Tao" reads like a tedious commentary on the Tao Te Ching that says far less in many more words. There are occasional insights that are worth reading, but they could have been condensed into about 5 pages; I would have happily done without the other 100 
 This jacket is worst outerwear that I have ever seen, although the image might look good in here. My size is usually between medium and large, I ordered size medium. However, when I received and tried it on, I end up look like wearing XXX-large jacket. Also, the craftmanship is very poor, the jacket feel uncomfortable and not smooth due to its uneven cut and badly sewing. I hate to return anything that I had order online because I have to waist my time to go to post office and I have pay the shipping and handling fee. Nevertheless, I returned it yesterday. Please don't waist your money on this order, it's not worth it at all.  
 There's a reason Polanski is not known as a comedy director.  I dont know.  Maybe this was funny by 60s standards?  Laugh-in?  This film certainly wasnt scarey.  And the cut erotic scenes are G-rated by 2007 standards

 Although the illustrations are good, this will not appeal to everyone. I was always a bit uncomfortable reading aloud a few of the traditional verses -- "she whipped them all soundly and sent them to bed" -- is an especially alarming example. But adults don't always give children enough credit; many generations have mentally sorted through these verses with no lasting harm. The rhythm, cadence and whimsy of the original versions have been sacrificed to be replaced with clumsy morals and motivational messages 
 I was appalled at the lack of editing, the poor grammar and the number of typos in this book.  Perhaps others could overlook it.  I was constantly distracted and therefore found it difficult to muster any respect for the author.  In addition, I felt that it was written for a rather uneducated audience, for folks who couldn't analyze and think for themselves.  The conversations of the characters were overstated.  In general, the concept of the book was ok, not spectacular, but the format was undigestible 
 In this sixth (but not final) installment of the movie series, what we get is little story and too much senseless action (with a sprinkling of hot tub sex).  This is a very disappointing film.  Although it is the last such LWnC movie from this creative team, it does not end the storyline (with 28 volumes in the manga series, we probably would have needed another 3-7 films).  So the patient, constant viewer gets instead a hack-and-slash film of mid-caliber.  The ending -- an over-extending action sequence set on a snowy slope -- is very unsatisfying; so are the characters:  unlike other LWnC films, we do not get to meet any new incidental characters.  As a result, the film is less about "Edo" soceity (which one cannot argue is the secondary if not primary goal of the manga team) and instead just a big showdown waiting to happen...waiting, waiting to happen.  The film is way too long and its pacing is horrible.  I think the fault with the film lies in these two things: 1) the writers/filmmakers chose poor source material.  The "five wheel" assassin team denies Itto and son the chance to mingle with regular Edo joes.  As a result, you do not get as I argued the best part of the series:  the rich detail of Edo life. 2) the filmmakers must have been overwhelmed with James Bond films like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and whatnot with their decision to make this movie "samurai on skis".  After the first few minutes of fighting on the snow, I was thinking "Enough already, I get it:  samurai can be badass even on slippery surfaces!"  Watch the first five and forever skip this sixth installment 
 It was about a girl who was picking out a present for herself.  Her mom was buying it for her.  She didn't know what to pick.  But finally she decided.  Read this book to find out what she picked 
 THE GIRL IN THE CAFE starts out with promise, the promise being to be a sweet May-December love story. Bill Nighy is Lawrence, an aging bachelor working for the government as a financial expert who meets a lovely young girl (Kelly Macdonald) in a cafe during coffee break. Mr. Nighy does a nice acting turn as the twitchy, shy older man and Ms. MacDonald as does a fine job as the adorable if undistinguished girl in the cafe. It's an unlikely but possible match that progresses when Lawrence asks Gina to go to a high-level international conference with him in Iceland. It is at that point that THE GIRL IN THE CAFE stops being a romance and starts becomming a political movie. Gina suddenly loses her sweetness and becomes rude, pushing her leftist political agenda, which, by the way, hardly anyone in the movie disagrees with. They are just not going far enough for the politically correct Gina. Gina's political outbursts are an amazing show of disrespect for Lawrence, who invited her on the Iceland junket in the first place, as it puts him at odds with his boss, the target of Gina's political salvos. It was at this point, having been disappointed in not getting a sweet, May-December romance and instead a vehicle for leftist political views, I decided it wasn't worth it and turned the DVD off, the victim of a bait and switch. If you are a lefty, the girl in the cafe's rants will be music to your ears. If so, hang in there; the second half of the movie may be worth it to you.

 Well for $99 I thought that this would be a good running shoe.  So far it seemed okay maybe takes a while to break in cause I haven't felt the bounce yet.  When I received my shoes I noticed the hole in the bottom and sides of the shoe and thought this was not a good idea.  But then I figured if it rains the insoles, along with my weight, would block any water from getting in the shoe.  Well I was wrong.  It had rained and the road was muddy so now a good pair of white socks have to be trashed.  The wet mud came through all the holes in the shoe including the insoles which also have holes in them.  The shoes are covered with mud now so I don't think I can send them back.  
 I got this stand as a kind of "freebie" when I purchased the excellent YPT-300 keyboard. At first I was baffled by the lack of instructions and the apparent lack of attachment screws. By reading another of the reviews here in Amazon I learned that the screws arrive inserted into the bottoms of the "X" pieces. Thanks to the person who pointed this out, as it isn't intuitively obvious even to those of us long accustomed to putting together small mechanical devices for our children.  I managed to figure out the proper hex key wrench to remove the screws and then quickly put together the keyboard stand. Once you have all of the pieces and the proper tool it's not rocket science. However, it soon became apparent that the stand isn't really made for my model keyboard. If you line the keyboard up directly on the stand it rocks back and forth. The only way to get it to stay put is to angle it a bit, which looks kind of odd  And there's a constant danger that someone will knock the keyboard right off of the stand onto the floor. Someone suggested a double-velcro strategy--not bad!  But this is a makeshift solution that can only partly mask the fact that the stand was never really designed for the keyboard I own.  I'd love to know what reasonably inexpensive stand would work better than this one 
 I usually read through one of Coulter's novel in a few days, exspecially her FBI/intrigue plots. I bought this as soon has it was released in paperback and still haven't finished it. The plot was slow and the main heroine a little too likable. Spoiler: Neighborhood teenagers diving on her body to protect her from bullets?! Talk about a work of fiction. No one expects a romance to be on our plane of reality, but in the same solar system would be nice 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 This DVD sucks, all the "fights" are fake, retarted, drawn out fights with girls that are not attractive and it was the worst waste of time I've ever had in my life.  I am now stupider for watching this DVD and buying it is on my list of regrets I have in life.  I wish I could say the only good part was.... but THERE WAS NO GOOD PART.  No shirts ripped off or good hits thrown, nothing.  I am a Marine stationed in Japan looking for a DVD to enjoy and this is what I get.  Where is the love 
 A sorry science fiction book (not a mystery novel in my judgement) not written by Ludlum but his name is on the cover to sell books (my viewpoint). The book takes advantage of todays terrorist threats and smallpox concerns to stir the readers interests but nothing in the book reflected the writings of Ludlum. I strongly suspect that Ludlum did not even write the outline for this book and the sorriest one, "The Paris Option" 
 I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT! Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter! WE KNOW! Don't tell us 100 times! This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing. Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work? Also, is it cold stone sober? Or STONE COLD SOBER? (it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?  I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable! I first excused it due to the death of her son.. But her talent never picked up again. From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff. If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially. If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs.. 
 This book tries to cover everything and succeeds at very little.  It covers everything from how to build a smoker from a used refrigerator to recipes.  But.. none of these topics are covered extensively or very well.    The illustrations are weak; the recipes are very weak; and, the general process discussions are haphazardly organized.    I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews, but am very disappointed 
 "Le Morte d'Arthur" or "The Death of Arthur" is an exceptionaly long and boring book no one should ever have to read 
 This book is quite a simple (and sometimes unusefull) introduction to design/build Speaker System. Design principles are old and it does not cover new trends such as implementation of spice models and simulation. Maybe only source code (written in BASIC for DOS!) can be interesting for an absolute beginner, ... eventhough it's cheap, save your money 
 I've read some Faulkner now, some required, most voluntarily, and still have yet to figure out what the fuss is about. Yes he can weave a story, but good grief, imagine the ego of a man who thinks he can turn out a story as incomprehensible as this. Right now I'm reading his bio by Jay Parini trying to decipher the Faulkner code.  I'll let you know if I do. I guess I've just read too much Flannery O'Conner (brilliant) and consider Faulkner a bit too precious. Slam me if you must. "A Light in August" was good, and I'm reading short stories that are wonderful, but please, present and future authors, try to engage the reader, not send him/her away frustrated 
 Let's start with P52, that credit card sized piece of papyrus, thought to be the oldest surviving scrap of scripture of the Gospel of John.  Mr. Ehrman repeatedly mentions that it was found in a "trash heap in Upper Egypt."  In fact, Mr. Ehrman does this every single time P52 is mentioned.   To paraphrase Ralph Manheim, "It is the half educated writer, without clear ideas, who generally feels that to say a thing only once is rather slight."  Mr. Ehrman is much too intelligent to be doing this by accident.  Therefore I believe it is done with purpose, and done oddly enough, without seeming too concerned about in which city it was discovered.  According to Dr. Bruce Metzger, to whom Mr. Ehrman dedicates his new book,  Misquoting Jesus, that fragment "was purchased in Egypt as early as 1920, but it sat unnoticed for years among similar fragments of papyri."  Hey, I thought a trash heap was a mountain of garbage one finds in a landfill with vermin crawling about and seagulls flying overhead.  Now it seems to include any stack of papyri that may contain holy scripture.  If that isn't a giveaway, I don't know what is.  While Mr. Ehrman gleefully tears apart any possibilities that most of the apocrypha could have any credibility (he claims nearly all of them are fakes or forgeries, and probably correctly), he nonchalantly mentions off the cuff that all but seven of the New Testament books are forged as well (those seven themselves also being tampered with)  The latter is, I believe, the real purpose for writing this book.  Lacking the courage to make this the focused topic, he covertly "slipped it in."  Since then he has made it the focus of a book called Misquoting Jesus.   The tendency for conspiracy theory to emanate from Mr. Ehrman is common.  There can be many reasons why so many more recently hand copied manuscripts of the New Testament differ from the oldest ones.  Mr. Ehrman points to large political movements most often while ignoring some more obvious reasons.  Case in point:  the Gospel of Mark.  He says the earliest copies show Jesus reacting angrily to just about everything.  Reasoning that the older versions must be the correct ones, Mr. Ehrman assumes the newer copies were purposely changed in order to sound more like Matthew, Luke, and John.  Could it actually be possible that these oldest copies have survived through the ages because it was known back then that they were wrong?  Consider that a scribe or two might've thought that a "compassionate" Jesus was rather wimpy and so rewrote Him to be angry all the time to show a more powerful God.  These "angry" copies were then set aside by church elders from the other often read "compassionate" copies and preserved for any number of reasons, perhaps as examples of bad behavior by "foolish knaves."  While the correct copies were handled so much that they fell apart and were discarded.  Just look at your own bookshelf.  The books that last the longest are the ones read the least.  It is an incorrect assumption on Ehrman's part that the oldest known copies were the only copies written at that time.    Regarding the differences among the four Gospel accounts:  If scribes were so prone to make the Gospels sound alike by changing them, why after 2,000 years and countless hand copied manuscripts are there still differences in accounts of events, such as when Jesus died in relation to the timing of the Passover meal or what garments were found in the tomb after the resurrection?   Also, could some of those "lost Christianities" which competed with what Mr. Ehrman refers to as the prevailing "proto-orthox" views have failed the test of time simply because they were wrong?  And if history is suspect anytime it is "written by the winners," schould we also be inclined to doubt the holocaust or the failure of Soviet Communism?  Perhaps Mr. Ehrman thinks that slavery got a "bad rap" from an historical perspective.  Maybe he will start rooting for the Chicago Cubs.  One can only wonder.  In defense of Mr. Ehrman, I will say that his writing style is engaging and lively, and not totally without fact.  But he does give away his agenda at times, which makes me question his credibility. While he is no Dan Brown, who still stands behind falsehoods to bring Jesus "down to our level," Mr. Ehrman seems to have an agenda he doesn't wish to share with us in his book.  It is not uncommon for secular Bible scholars to attack the KJV simply to shake the foundation of the "religious right."  After hearing Mr. Ehrman interviewed on NPR, that is exactly what I think he's doing.  It is expected that a growning number of "secular fundamentalists" will applaud anything that contradicts the New Testament, rejoicing in not having a God looking over their shoulders and telling them who they can and can't sleep with 
 Bad reviews typically receive bad reviews. So be it. After several chapters of trying to decide whether the problem was me or the author, I simply gave up. This is no easy read. I don't think we gain much from an endless list of data. 
 Rairly have I read a book that I hate.  This is it!  Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room.  Tony's fan base just lost one 
 I was initially impressed with this book, even after seeing a couple pages of utter garbage in the first part. All I wanted was a quick review before my serious books came, and having programmed DX before I could promptly correct and move on, but enough was enough! I can best describe parts of this book as rough notes fed to a blender and then pasted into the chapters with a leaf-blower. That goes for the `code' samples as well.  For a complete beginner these errors may be significant enough to possibly detract and frustrate the learning experience. Not a good thing, especially considering that's the book's targeted audience. There is no excuse for this.  More advanced developers will cringe and cringe until they finally damage something or hurt someone as they throw this waste across their office. Also not a good thing.  An alternative book that covers the same ground quite a bit more soundly is Frank Luna's Introduction to 3D Game Programming with DX9, which I finally received & promptly read from one end to the other & moved on to other books now. It's a solid work bolted tight with some good code.  2 Stars, for a publishing a work containing some content I wouldn't even turn in as homework. 
 Overly dramatic breathy singing, baaaaad falsetto, creepy desperate lyrics. If it's supposed to be a joke, I just don't get it. If it's serious, I don't get it either. To each their own, but I hate it 
 Very amateurishly written, downright "corny" plot that thinly tries to disguise a conservative, backwards political agenda.  Don't waste your time on this one 
 What a horrible book. It seems that the writer has traveled little and her views are provincial at best... Don't bother!!! 
 This biography is articulately written. It provides valuable detail onthe end of Kerouac's life and depicts his/mother's schizoid repeatedmoves from north to south and back.Kerouac's grissly death is sad toread. However, this biography is utterably flawed with dubiousrecollections from Ginsberg contradicting his previous statements onthe topic of Kerouac's sexuality; Gore Vidal, who William Burrourghreferred to as an inveterate liar back in 1948; and other rememberedtales (some contradictory from those still living). There is contenthere which is shameful and tasteless like Kerouac's...lists and thedespicable description of his firt sexual encounter with his lastwife. The writer also recounts sexual episodes directly from Kerouac'swriting and conjectures complex (and obvious) psychological reasonsfor what he believes to be Kerouac's sexual duplicity-which infact(the duplicity)is contradicted by Kerouac's openness on thematter. The overall thrust of the book is contrived and exaggerated... 
 This thing basically self destructed the first week.  The handle pieces wouldn't stay together and when I pushed down on the handle to tighten the pieces together the base fell apart.  Not worth the money!  I was very disappointed 
 I bought this book because I am a Kellerman fan and usually enjoy his work.  This one is far below his usual quality!  The characters are poorly developed and, by the end of the book, I really didn't care what happened to any of them.  There are a bunch of contrived coincidences, which are simply ludicrous and insulting to the reader.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 The price entices you and then you lose any savings on the outrageous shipping charges 
 It took two people to write this book? I was pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40-something reader but this book really was a waste of my time. You can see the ending a mile away, for one, but that didn't really bother me. It was the writing. The main character suffers from a syndrome that's unfortunately common to chick-lit heroines, which is to speak in an overly quippy, aren't-I-clever with my snappy dialog way. Nearly every one of her sentences included a quip/joke (or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke). Real people just don't talk that way, and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her. By the way, my copy had the first chapter of these authors' next book attached at the end, and they've basically created the same two main characters: the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend. I won't bother with it 
 The most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content, but, based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers, that most people actually believe this drivel. How can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill-informed? The answer is that we cannot. I will not bother to go through a detailed criticism, not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it, but because, in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in, no one would believe it. Today, the "truth" depends much more on one's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence. 
 I have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly.  There are a lot of good books out there, Dan Harrington's the very best, but this isnt one of them.  Too much ego here and not enough helpful information 
 The entire concept of writing fiction of ANY kind is to use your imagination mixed with the things that you know.  A book to TELL you how to write fantasy does not make a bit of sense!  If you are building a world, use common sense and round it out, smooth the edges, be as 'realistic' as you can for a Fantasy story.  The problem with Fantasy these days is that all Elves are the same; all Dwarves are the same, all Goblins are the same...every book written is basically a carbon copy of the last one.  These races DO NOT EXIST in our world, therefore you cannot say they MUST be one way or another.  Get back to IMAGINATION - just use the sense you were given.  TRUE old fashioned imagination has created the BEST books ever read 
 i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!  PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.  
 I have a number of excellent books on Flower Remedies and bought this because I thought that it would add a new angle.  In fact, it was rather dull and obvious in its approach and did not have a new, or intelligent, or  intuitive addition to the already overcrowded market on Bach remedies.   There are more than 650 other remedies out there, Bach is only a small  sample.  To write yet another book on the subject you need to have a very  special feel for them, and the author doesn't.  He's no medical intuitive.   I sent the book back 
 All the zombies kept telling me to purchase the Iliad and were raving about how intellectual it was.  The age of it should have been a first clue.  Really a rather boring read that is tripe with inept ideals.  Homer Simpson was named after this guy but I believe that he has more insight into the subject matter than the original home boy they call Homer.  Good for using to set your coffee mug on and start a fire with in the fireplace, but beyond that it is really a lot of rubbish.  I wish Penguin Classics would actually publish classic reading material instead of a lot of blah blah 
 One part uncontroversial cognitive psychology and five parts lit-crit bluff--the kind the author clearly doesn't understand, and hopes no one else in the seminar will admit they don't either.  To be fair, the almost random juxtaposition of bits of continental philosofeces is consistent with the author's apparent contempt for reason.    If this book was intended to be a hoax, or a test of editorial standards similar to Alan Sokal's bogus article in "Social Text", then I apologize for the low rating, but it really is about time to reveal the joke.  
 I picked up this movie on accident, but I doubt that it was fate! It's not horrible, but rather unnatural (acting) and uninteresting (plot, direction). I wondered how a movie like this could be made? And why? However I'm strangely fascinated by this film because I actually attempted to see it a second time, because I just couldn't believe that such a horrid movie could be made. Despite my good intentions however, I could only take the film for about 10 mins the second time around. Some gay films are really bad in terms of acting and story line, but this one takes the cake! Why do some gay movies have to be so bad? I haven't found an answer to that one yet, however I have a feeling that it's a conspiracy. The Republicans are funding terrible gay movies to make the entire population straight! ;)   If you like Bar Girls, you may like this one. However, if you like High Art and But I'm a Cheerleader, your best bet is to run as far away from this movie as possible. 
 I ordered this book in June and here it is August and I have never received it. I never have any problems with the private dealers they are prompt and efficient. Don't know why it should be any different from amazon. Last tracking I could find on it was in Phila. some where. I don't live in Phila., nor do I have time to spend tracking. If I had that kind of time I would just go to the store 
 This is a pretty good collection for the Mickey beginner. I wouldn't purchase it however if you already have the Walt Disney Treasures "Mickey Mouse in Living Color" series because all the shorts are on those DVDs as well 
 The book starts out with how wonderful this Dharma Mittra is (by the editors).  Then Dharma Mittra tells you how wonderful he is and barely scratches the surface of a Yoga practice that is compatible with a busy life.  The rest of the book is pictures of Dharma Mittra in yoga poses.  His gentialia are so prominent in most of the poses it is obscene.  I am not a prude after 25 years of nursing but please!  When I tried to use the book as examples of what poses should look like all I got was laughter.  Even from my supervisor!   There are no explanations of how to get into or out of the poses safely.  No suggestions to adapt the poses and no pointing out the nuances of a pose, breathing suggestions, or even a notation of what conditions the poses may help with.   This book doesn't deserve a star at all but rather a parental warning label 
 Mark Levin's book falls into some of the usual pitfalls that almost all biased political argumentation today falls into--evidence is often stretched and recontextualized to fit certain predisposed conclusions.  The book is clearly well researched, and Levin is no doubt quite knowledgeable about legal process and the language of the US Constitution, but his conclusions are often stretched to a degree that no longer fits the evidence.  I would hesitate comparing his method to a smokescreen, for I am not entirely sure if Levin is purposefully making exaggerated claims that he doesn't support but artfully disguises in the ethos of research, but at the core of many of his ideas are assumptions or basic contradictions that he just can't back up.  For example, Levin is trying to show with this book that there is a long-term conspiracy of liberalism that has been slowly forging opportunities for itself in the process of applying the Constitution to the cases before it so that there would be precedent to back what Levin calls unConstitutional decisions like in Roe vs. Wade.  Levin pushes a good case to look further (personally) into the basis of that and other decisions and if they do have Constitutional basis, but Levin instead goes into a history lesson of the decisions that predicated decisions like Roe vs. Wade with the assumption that every opportunity opened in previous decisions regarding things like the right to privacy was in fact the doing of a long-term liberal plan to open the doors of power for an activist court.  Certainly, legal cases are often made on the grounds of precedent, but instead of revealing the focus on precedent rather than the Constitution as a problem in the deliberations of the Supreme Court, Levin tries to turn the problem into an unsupportable conspiracy that comes across on the edge of paranoia rather than sound, unbiased reason.  And when Levin starts out the book stating that the justices should be treated as humans rather than gods, he wants to convey the idea that their actions may be questioned, but will not acknowledge himself that the history of precedents may also be the mistakes of the same human beings whom he does not want us to deify.  Levin also breaks his guise of the the reasonable viewer of history when he tries to establish the intents of the founding fathers, equating Jefferson's participation in prayer services at Congress as a direct negation of his over-used mention of the wall of separation.  Clearly, Levin cannot see no possible correlation between the two, and thus the questioning of the validity of prayer in schools must be a moot argument.  Just to make sure that his bias is clear, he throws in a little slippery scare tactic of suggesting a future where religious observance is also banned in the home.  Levin makes the same kind of rhetorical blunders when he suggests that Blackmun may have turned 'left' under the influence of his wife (while giving a little shot in the arm to Richard Nixon for having the foresight of wanting to base a Supreme Court nomination partly on the quality of a man's wife).  When discussing the famous argument over the inclusion of "under God" in the pledge of allegiance, Levin focuses more on how much the plaintiff's daughter actually wanted to say the phrase, which is of course moot when considering the actual legitimacy of requiring the phrase in a patriotic statement.  In the end, this book comes across as yet another argument of bias in what has clearly become a divisive popular culture--evidently, a book isn't commercially viable unless it has a line to hold, no matter which side. 
 I wanted to like this book.  I wanted to learn something about the modern rise of anti-semitism.  Sometimes, you just don't get what you want.  I read the book, hoping to answer some serious questions: Is anti-Zionism the same as anti-semitism ?  Are Jewish anti-Zionists experiencing self-hate ?  Is the rise of European anti-semitism a product of long lasting traditions or a by-product of Muslim immigration ?  I still have these questions.  The book does attempt to address these issues.  It does so by a selectively culling statements, events, and quotes.  Where a book of this nature would demand 100's of pages, the author here feels that his cobbled collection of editorials can address these issues with limited research and less than 200 pages.  It is tragic that such a serious topic is handled, so casually.  Like many people, I fear a second Holocaust prompted by Iranian nuclear ambitions.  What does Schoenfeld think of this issue ?  He agrees that such a threat exists, but sees fit to address it in only one paragraph.  What about a solution to the rise of anti-semitism ?  The only one I can find, is the belief that a stable democratic Iraq will reduce the phenomena.  I don't want to get too political here, but that's a pretty disquieting source of optimism.  There is something here, but there's not quite enough.  I don't disagree with the author, but I don't feel that throwing out a collection of individual opinions constitutes a serious analysis of a serious topic. 
 I was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when I found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early.  I tried fiddling with the DST setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than I wanted.  The brightness may be a problem for some people but I found it reasonable.  Overall a good docking station, but a poor alarm clock 
 I was hoping this would be the botanical answer to "Animal." Boy, was I wrong.  The book's shortcomings are enormous. For starters, most of the information provided is about the conservation and gardening of plants. Usually, an entry leads off with a couple lines about the plant's appearance, and what kind of habitat it lives in. (Sometimes this information is tucked deep into the entry, however -- or even left to a one-sentence picture caption.) The rest of the text will be spent on conservation information and cultivation tips.  Don't get me wrong: I am very much committed to conservation ("Animal" had very good information on this score), and gardens are a joy. But I had hoped to LEARN something ABOUT THE PLANTS THEMSELVES. (What makes this plant distinctive? How is it related to other plants? How do it's strange-looking roots work? etc.) On this score, the book outright fails, and fails miserably. There are a few occasions where it goes into more detail than others, but overall, it's just not much help. See, for but two examples, oaks (genus Quercus) or baobabs (Adansonia). If you want to know, say, why acorns have caps, or how baobabs store water, you're out of luck.  Aside from the general lack of information related to anything other than conservation and gardening, the organization is not particularly helpful, either. The entries are organized into groups like "Herbaceous Plants" and "Trees and Shrubs." While these groupings might be useful to garders, they're not scientific, and they don't tell you anything about what sets different groups of plants apart from one another. In other words, you don't get a very good idea of plant diversity and interrelationships.  Finally, there are some omissions that I found just mind-boggling. Saguaros, for example, get a couple picture captions, and that's about it. Want to know why they're so big, or whether and how their size requires them to do things differently from other cacti? Tough. Mosses are also all but completely ignored.  I guess that from a garderner's perspective, maybe the book is great. Maybe that's the intended audience, and maybe it deserves five stars from those who want to know how to grow, say, monkey puzzle trees.  But if you want to know about what exactly a monkey puzzle tree is, about what's so unique about it and how it works -- in short, if you're familiar with "Animal" and want a plant book that resembles it -- then I think you'll be VERY disappointed. I certainly was. 
 To put it succinctly, Brendan Fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis, which is then swiped by Joe Pesci, the homeless dude who, predictably, is really quite wise.  The problem is that his "wise" sayings aren't really too wise; he's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent, but doesn't really know that much. Joe Pesci's character is pretty annoying.  That's probably why he ended up friends with Brendan Fraser's character 
 This book looked promising when I purchased it-the collaboration of a photographer and writer to produce a book that gives "voice" to the cat.  I was disappointed that the reality did not live up to the promise.  The photographs were not outstanding, I have seen better in several similiar collections.  The narrative was truly disappointing.  I felt that Roy Blount Jr really has no understanding of, or true appreciation for, cats.  While he may have lived with cats in the past, and may have fond memories of some of them, the words he gave to the photographs fail to capture the essense of cats in all but one or two instances. I would highly recommend any of the willow creek books (such as "What Cats Teach Us", "Bad Kitties" or "Cat Rules" in place of this book 
 If you find another source for this movie, pursue it! I liked the movie very much, and saw it first produced on Showtime Entertainment.  This copy appears to be burn made from someone's TV set.  Good movie for cheesy fun films, poor quality recording. 
 I don't get the politics of Tony Bennett saying "yes, dear" to KD Lang at the end of the 1st number, but sad to say, the whole album seems an overproduced mistake, including sappy saxophone interludes and treacly high-pitched violin countermelodies.  I love sax.  I mean, I love saxophones and saxophone players as if they were part of my family.  But someone has got to stop this easy listenin' moony-waily lushly lackadaisical sinuous syrupy "smooth jazz" exploitation of just one tiny, embarrassing aspect of the saxophone's otherwise terrific character.  But I doubt the small-minded no-talents who produced this album would ever get the drift.  Note to Word Lovers:  "Treacle" originally meant "a medicinal compound formerly in wide use as a remedy against poison."  However, Tony and KD got suckered into singing on an album that's practically poisonous itself 
 This guy makes me cringe.  He tells a magazine that the only thing he hasn't gained from making money from his records is a new boyfriend, what kind of message is that to the young?  His music is all written for him and as for his look, its hardly the next best thing.  Hyped up crap.  And as for the film he has just made with people taking their clothes off, need I say more 
 I was using this thing religiously from my 5th month with coco butter as well. I still got stretch marks ba 
 Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write 
 Myths are important, but they should not be labeled history.  1.  George Washington was not a great guerilla leader; he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines--just like the redcoats. Washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops. 2.  Ronald Reagan did not begin the nuclear "disarming" of the Soviet Union.  Eisenhower and Kennedy tried, but (LBJ?) Nixon and Carter were able to bring the ABM treaty, the SALT treaties and he START treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals.  Reagan did have success with theater wrapons in Europe, but the "big nukes" that could end civilization were already being cut back.  This is an interesting book about Reagan and Peggy Noonan, but some of the history cited is WRONG 
 CD-1, I could barely tolerate.  I personnally haven't heard too many Top 40 Pop songs remixed as trance versions that I have actually liked, anywhere.  CD-2 Much improved. Pretty good track selection if you are into house.  I'm more of a trance fan.    Overall, disappointed 
 I don't know who JJ Cole made this hat for, my daughter had the tiniest head and it still didn't fit.  Waste of money 
 I contacted the author, Sheila Mello, to purchase this title directly from the publisher.  Sheila was very rude and unhelpful.  She hung up on me once.  After contacting her again she told me that it was too much trouble for her to sell me one copy and said to go elsewhere.  Personally, this is very bad business and not a good way to promote your book 
 Unlike the Chicken Soup authors, Dan feels it's neccessary to add his opinion at the end of each story which leaves the impression he's telling the reader how to feel or react to the story.  These heartwarming, tender stories speak for themselves. It's a very diappointing purchase 
 First off, special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality. But at least this is better than the abomination that was JAWS.  The only dinosaur movie I can think of that's worse than this is RAPTOR, which consists of parts of the three Carnosaur movies cut & pasted together.  It has some redeeming feature in that Ian Malcom and John somedoy (I forget his last name... the guy who owns the park) were actually interesting characters. I guess Steve Speilberg finally realised that monster/animal attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey's rear end about. Unfortunately, the boring, stereotypical Alan Grant was the central character in this.  If you want to watch a Steven Spielburg movie that's actually good, watch E.T. or something. Or "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (even though recommending a sequel may seem lame, the sequel is a million times better than this)  If you want to see a dinosaur movie, then watch either the sequel to this movie, or Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Lost World". I would also recomend the 'Carnosaur' movies but I think they're out of print.  If you want to see a movie where Sam Neill plays an interesting chracter, watch 'In the Mouth of Madness' or 'Triangle'  But definitely avoid this movie. The only reason I even own it is because it was sold in a box set with "The Lost World: Jurassic Park 
 Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought 
 Gosh, where to start?  The casting was so-so, the acting was dire, the sets were appalling...  Although Annette Bening did well and so did Colin Firth, you could not really see how evil they were - especially Colin Firth who just seemed like a bit of an oaf (did he wear false teeth for this movie?)  He had on this really idiotic smile half the time - rather than the scheming smile we should expect from Valmont.  Meg Tilly acted as if she was reading straight from an autocue.  And Danceny!  Eugh. For some reason, France was made to seem like a perpetual carnival as well.  What was it with the street scenes?    Just don't even bother.  If you want to see Dangerous Liaisons, go see the one with Malkovich and Close.  You can definitely feel the underlying current of emotions throughout the entire film 
 This book would've been a "find" if I were in my early teens, but for any adult who considers themselves a bibliophile, this book is just too lightweight.  Yes, it is about books and literature, but the coverage is extremely shallow.  I would consider this to be something like the Reader's Digest Condensed Books form of Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia.  Buy that work instead of you're looking for a good reference work on literature 
 I was not impressed with this book.  Very little technical data, no data on many of the excellent images in the book.  The writting was flowery and arty rather than concise with information to convey.  If your looking for a book to teach you something, I would not recommend this book.    John Shaw's Nature Photography book is, however, outstanding 
 Unfortunatly this book is very misleading.  He often makes statements that go something like this..... Normally you would never use this kind of method and I would avoid it in most circumstances, but this one pro does it all the time, and so does this other guy.  He then goes rambling on about all these different things that he just said you should never do and often leaves the basic concept he was addressing with a meager 4 sentences.  We all get the idea that bowling involves your own litte variations, but its always based on a solid set of fundementals.  I just wish he would have spent more time on the basics then the rare fundamental opposites.  
 There are lots to like about this book. As the back cover says, it "captures the heat, the fury, and the intense human drama" of the Southern conflict. But I don't trust what the author presents as "facts."  That is, some of his research relies on books that relied on dubious 19th century writers. Which means that Lt. Colonel Banastre Tarleton is painted as pure evil, from the first page we meet him. Example: a couple of his men attacked some women at a plantation. Edgar writes, "Although several of the dragoons involved were disciplined, their commander was not." This gives the wrong impression of Tarleton's actions, or inactions, regarding this matter. Surely Edgar knows that Tarleton, when told of what had happened, sent a surgeon and 12 men to guard the women, and recommended hanging for these men. All in all, I'm left with the impression that the book sacrifices detail to paint a picture that isn't entirely accurate. Simply put, I'm unable to trust what I read. 
 Great looking beans.  Unfortunately, the packages are also full of drug store beetles, a common pantry pest.  I could see them as soon as I opened the box.  Why did they not catch this at Bob's Red Mill 
 The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart.  I couldn't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.    Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims.  Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF.  I tried this bra on in a 38 DD.  I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support.  Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all.  That is not the effect I want when I go strapless.  Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety 
 Ritter flip-flopped his WMD position after finding a place on Al Jazeera's payroll.  Al Jazeera is openly sympathetic to Islamofascists, who aim to kill us.  Ritter's arrest was not his first pedophilia-related entanglement, and it's a bit too "black helicopter" to think that local law enforcement sleazebag round-ups are really plots to silence political enemies 
 DeMille has done a rotten job with this book.  Aspects of the plot(which isn't too bad) are never resolved.  If you must read this badly written book, wait until it goes on sale. 
 In the Edward Burns film "The Groomsmen" 5 males--friends since childhood--prepare for a wedding due to take place in a few days. Paulie (Edward Burns) is the bridegroom who is marrying longtime girlfriend Sue (Brittany Murphy). The marriage is set in motion by the fact that Sue is five months pregnant, and while Paulie says he loves Sue, he's also experiencing a degree of pressure and reluctance due to the fact he's about to become a father.   Paulie's four friends--who are all locked in various stages of delayed adolescence--react to his impending marriage in different ways. Paulie's doubts are echoed by his brother Jimbo (Donald Logue). Jimbo is married to Julianna (Heather Burns) and he is experiencing marital problems of his own. Loser Mike Sullivan (Jay Mohr) still lives at home and can't seem to get over his ex-wife. Paulie's married friend Dez (Matthew Lillard) acknowledges that married life and children take all his free time, but he advocates fatherhood as a maturing process to everyone. TC (John Leguizamo) is the fifth male of the group--he left abruptly 8 years before, and while he's returned for Paulie's wedding, there are also some old scores to be settled.   "The Groomsmen" seems to be a film based on ideas--and as such the characters are 'types' who have various issues, and these issues are miraculously worked through in the days leading up to the wedding. Some of the emotional scenes are overdone and consequently do not seem realistic (TC's temper tantrum at his father's house, for example). Several overly long scenes depict Paulie and his group of friends in their part-time band mode, and these scenes come across as pure indulgence.  Dez is portrayed as the sage of this group--he has the most successful family life, and so Paulie turns to Dez, ultimately, for advice on marriage and fatherhood. One of the film's pivotal issues is Paulie's adjustment to his upcoming role, and while acceptance of the responsibilities of married life and fatherhood are unarguably critical, the film's treatment of Paulie's dilemma is troubling. And this is mainly manifested in the portrayal of Sue--an extremely annoying, clingy and demanding woman who goes around the house eternally rubbing her stomach while she flexes her domestic tyrant muscles and harangues Paulie for manifestations of his commitment. The film's message seems to be that it's a good thing for Paulie to respect Sue's expectations and her exacting demands for their relationship, and that their future is all warm and fuzzy thanks to Paulie's sublime subservience to his new role. But ultimately this feel-good film seems delusional and produces only a falsely optimistic ending--displacedhuma 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 When I purchased this, I was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped.   The skin is so thin, that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons.  The belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that I used it.  Don't waste your money, spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while.  
 This is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. I picked it up on the strength of Deep South, which I thought was really terrific. It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback.  Flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeon's own family. The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. Some may like the flavor that this element provides, but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South, and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. Flashback, on the other hand, felt painfully contrived. The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary.   If you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel, then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. Judging from the reviews, not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines.  I will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book, because I did like Deep South so much. It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing, but hope that it can be redeemed with a third. 
 Despite their feeble assertion at one point that it's all the fault of "the media" for pitting careerist mothers against stay-at-home mothers in the so-called "Mommy Wars", the authors make it perfectly plain which side they are on.  The entire book is a long diatribe in favour of only one point of view, that the government should provide universal day care because, if only they knew it, all mothers really want to work.  (And if they don't, they are servile, baby puke-stained, backwards dullards who are probably too stupid to understand the thousand and one mocking jibes the authors fling in their direction.)  The most inane part of the book is a long chapter in which much is made of the baby-making obsession touted in the pages of "People" and other celebrity rags, with all those perfectly groomed actresses posing on the covers with their adorable infants.  Somehow, the authors think this is the primary means by which the women of America have been duped into embracing what they call the "New Momism."  Do they really think most women look to this sort of stuff when they make their major life choices?  And to the extent that some of them actually do, why are they so susceptible to it?  The authors never bother to explore that question, because they might not like the answers.  The ideology of feminism, with its militant insistence that women focus on their careers and put off getting married and having children, means there are more women than ever before for whom child-raising is only an imagined, not actual experience.  Is it any wonder that they have no "reality check" to counteract the rosy fantasy of these insipid mags?  Even women who have kids, if they spend long hours at their careers are not in tune with the day-to-day, hour-to-hour reality of child-rearing.  Women who spend all day with their children would know better than to swallow this pap, and in fact, in the 1970's when female homemakers were still far more common than now, authors like Erma Bombeck could write candidly and with great humour about the drawbacks of having kids.  Yes, there is a regrettable child-centeredness in American life today, especially among the well-to-do.  Plenty of people are raising spoiled brats and acceding to their demands to be entertained and feted every second.  But there is a middle way between neglecting your kids to pursue a high-powered career, and smothering them with too much unhealthy attention and micro-managing their entire lives (in effect, making child-raising a "career", complete with the pushy, aggressive competitiveness that comes with striving in the world of the marketplace).  The whole point of raising children at home, if you do it sensibly, is to be available when your children need you, and an attentive mother knows that this does not happen in ways that can conform to a work schedule.  The authors have harsh words to say about any mother assuming what they call the "subject position" of her child.  This is fine if you're being a reasonable parent trying to set standards of discipline and teach your kids there are other humans in the world besides themselves.  It's not so fine if declining to inhabit your child's subject position means you refuse to imagine what it might actually be like to be a two-year-old dragged out of the safety of home every morning to be dumped in a day care center all day.  The only good point the authors make, and the only section of the book worth reading, is the chapter on the demonization of welfare mothers.  Yes, the conservative right is extremely hypocritical in insisting on white, middle-class mothers staying at home with their kids, while at the same time demanding that poor (and mostly black) mothers work.  This deserves to be pointed out.  But one good argument does not redeem the rest of the book.  If feminists like Douglas have their way, the American taxpayers (including working men whose wives stay at home with the kids) will be burdened by further taxes to pay for some women to work while their children are warehoused in govt-run day care.  Viewed against this light, every woman who wants to stay home and raise her own children poses a threat to the ideology of feminists, who want to "normalize" the working mother in order to push through their agenda.  So SAHMs, starting speaking out, and speak out loudly -- there IS a war against you, and this book is one of the salvos 
 Definitely contains their great hits, however the remastering is very poor. Listen to it with or without earphones and you can hear bad distortion. My vinyl recordings of these songs sound 1000% better 
 I usually enjoy her books but this one was truly disappointing. Such a silly plot. I finished it but kept saying to myself..."Why not just toss this one?" 
 I had very high expectations of this book and looked forward for ages for its arrival and was thrilled when I was informed it had arrived.  Immediate disappointment occurred upon seeing the book, it is no taller than a compact disc and not much wider.  I was expecting a much larger book not one where the picture on Amazon is just about actual size.  Still if the content of the book had been superb I wouldn't have cared that much. Very average effort would be being nice describing what is inside.  The best three signs in the book are on the cover, most are pretty average and have been doing the rounds on the Internet for years.    While some locations are specific a lot of the credits are also rather vague so if you actually wanted to find the sign for yourself you'll have a bit of a mission.  Also some of these photographs have been cropped so all you see is the signs themselves and not what surrounds, meaning we are seeing them out of context and they are not that funny in real life.  For example the Bind Persons Cross Here sign with the vague location of Australia (is actually at Nobbys Beach, Gold Coast QLD) does not show the school for blind children which is right next to it nor the other signs next to it warning motorists on the Highway to slow down due to the crossing.           If you've been using e-mail for over a year or so you will no doubt have seen the majority of these signs before.  In fact the best ones you've seen there you will find are not in here.  Don't waste your money!   
 Changing the canister (which you have to do once for every large room) is a messy undertaking.  Even if you're careful, dust and dirt slide out with the canister - dropping a mess onto the floor you just had to roll the Hoover WindTunnel over several times to get "clean."  What a waste of money 
              ......and that was my review, thank you very much 
 Although I have found Robert Kiyosaki's books to be excellent, I am SO unimpressed, bored, and resentful of this book. Basically, it is almost 300 pages of this phrase right here: "Get professional help". There- done. You have now read the book. I agree with many of the other reviews here, in that it really isn't helpful to someone interested in protecting their ideas, but only helpful to Kiyosaki and the author. This is an "Advisor" series book, and it has made me skeptical of the rest of them. Sales Dogs is also not helpful unless you are already experienced in sales 
 After only 2 months this toy fell apart. My daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail's threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams. $20 is not cheap for this toy and I think the quality should have been alot better 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this dope, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 Q: Mr. President, in your speeches now, you rarely talk or mention Osama bin Laden. Why is that? [...]  BUSH: ... I don't know where he is. Nor -- you know, I just don't spend that much time on him really, to be honest with you [...]  Q: Do you believe the threat that bin Laden posed won't truly be eliminated until he is found either dead of alive?  BUSH: As I say, we hadn't heard much from him. And I wouldn't necessarily say he's at the center of any command structure. And, you know, again, I don't know where he is.  I'll repeat what I said: I truly am not that concerned about him.    -President George W. Bush, March 13, 200 
 Okay if you just want sex, but for good writing look elsewhere 
 Totally disappointing.  From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue .  I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues.  Alas, there were none.  Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board & try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher 
 I see that some people were helped by this book.  I would not recommend this book for someone who has not experienced sex.  The advice to virgins was disgusting.  The writers say that the sexual act is not natural and that people need help enjoying it.  The writer also suggests techniques of preparation for the virgin the month before that most assuredly would either lead to depending on yourself for fulfillment or it would train a young lady to not be responsive.  I thought the book was sick.  It turns women into an object of function. It also talks about men being 100% head of the household and women being 100% submissive.  The authors are a husband and wife but I can't hear a woman's voice anywhere in this book.  The cover is pretty so she probably had something to do with that. I'm sure she submitted completely to him in the writing of this book and that is why it is completely clinical and even crude 
 So I thought that investing in the most recent edition of this book would behoove me, but upon looking up one of the "author's picks," for lodging, I discover that he and Lonely Planet have not updated the book for the hotel's *price.*  This is really important to me, as I work in non-profit and can't afford expensive digs when travelling.    The author and Lonely Planet state that Renakse Hotel in Phnom Penh costs $25-50/night.  I understand that hotel prices change over time, but prices I bought this book fresh off the press last month.  Prices at Renakse are now a whopping $76-100/night and they have been since the end of 2004.  The author's writing style is great, but you may want to pick up an older version of the book (4th edition seems just the same as this one when I read it before getting this one) and save the extra bucks.  
 Let's start off with the technical problems. First, Disc one, track five is not "The Rovin' Cowboy", but actually "Chant of the Wanderer." This really stands out when hearing a 1947 recording tossed in the middle of a bunch of 1935 recordings. Also, "Chant of the Wanderer" is the closing track on disc two, which means you get "Chant of the Wanderer" twice and NO "The Rovin' Cowboy". Ouch!  Secondly, disc four is all screwed up with it's track sequencing. The songs are printed one way, but the disc plays it another. Pretty sloppy stuff from Proper records.   Maybe it's just me, but I also felt the song selection wasn't quite up to the Proper standards. Before I heard this box set I thought I WAS a fan, but now I question that. How much of a fan can I really be, when I'm skipping 25% of the songs. Maybe I'm just a person that needs a "best of" collection. I hope Proper has the Andrews Sisters in their pipeline. But, I also hope they do a better job of quality control!   Finally, why can't these compilations of old 78's have a few more seconds between them? Essentially we have a bunch of singles all crammed together, so why not let them have some breathing room. You could never change the records that quickly. As I recall, the British Beatles albums from 1963 to 1966 had a seven second break between songs. I loved it! It was like letting dust settle before being inundated with another song right away. It basically gives each song it's own spotlight. Oh, the days of one song at a time 
 Poorly written. Brutal content. Chinese portrayed as barbaric people with animalistic behavior. Lalu's father sells her to bandits knowing 50 men plan to gang rape her to death.Refers to how her dark skin lessens value. Lalu, 13, contemplates suicide as an honorable solution. The bandits draw lots to see who goes first. 43 is upset because she will be "mushy" by his turn. She is sold to a brothel, ends up in a saloon owned by Hong King,a cruel man who rapes and prostitutes her. Writing painfully too simple. After the first 100 pages, most of this book moves slowly like an amatuer biography written by a family member about grandma. A boring, brutal book written at a 1st grade level. Can be disturbing to those sensitive about children being raped 
 This was assigned for summer reading in freshman yr at my college. I can't believe gibberish stuff like this gets published. Kingston's past accounts were boring to read about, at times confusing with all the muti-named relatives. The events were and pointless and just blah. I tried to make it to the end of the book, but sadly I didn't. It was just too boring! I would give this less than one star if I could. Do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague. 
 Most of the songs chosen were not major house records in terms of popularity or sales and did not gather any underground following 
 P.J. O'Rourke, a "fellow" at the Washington-based Cato Institute, sets out to answer the question "why do some places prosper and thrive while others just suck?" The problem with that premise is that... well the premise sucks.  Being based on yardsticks like GDP, GNP, GNR (and potentially the NFL and NHL) the book is fashioned in terms used by contemporary and illegitimate, notions which do not reflect progress, happiness or well-being and instead focus on how much companies can sell you stuff.   Economics is discussed as a passing topic as relates to O'Rourke's observations, but the bulk of the book is a human essay combined with the author's travelogue of places like Moscow, Hong Kong, Tanzania, Albania, Cuba and more. Of course, humour being the front man, the writer duly agrees upfront that the numbers are crap, the facts are a joke, Republicans need a plug or two (as do 'non-partisan' [snort] think-tanks), but the book is hit and miss both philosophically and stylistically. The book asks good questions, but P.J. is not an awfully good writer. The passages veer between funny and plain old boring or sophisticated and akin to someone hollering at a frat part. The naked observations of far-flung places are, perhaps, the best part of the book given the absurdity of the situation. Fathoming and shaping reality in order to lasso intellectual discourse can only go so far however (CNN is an alternate universe).   O'Rourke might like to call Sweden socialist as a put-down, which is all good given that Scandinavian country's untouchable credentials, but last some one checked workers did not own the means of production there. Cuba might have throngs of people standing around doing nothing - isn't that the forte of think-tanks? - yet it would be fun to see how the country would do without American embargoes and overt aggression. A "laissez-faire" attitude towards commerce might have propelled a strategically-located rock called Hong Kong into riches (there is that subjective term, again), but how does the author explain the centrally planned and executed economies of Korea, China, Malaysia, Singapore or Dubai which have recently outpaced beacons of capitalism like America and Haiti? To criticize the use of Mandarin by Chinese officials in Hong Kong makes sense until, only a second later, one notices that the use of English is even more absurd and foreign there.   Stick with the one about the skeleton in the bar next time, P.J 
 You can purchase and enjoy each of the seasons individually for half this price.  Amazon had a nice little link when I was buying season one, saying something to the effect of: "Planning on watching the whole series? Click here to save!"  I'm sure this isn't anything nefarious on amazon's part, just a dumb mistake.    Other reviews have already stated this fact but I figure the more saturated the reviews are with this warning the best chance we have of keeping people from wasting their money 
 I'm an agronomist and I read this trash-book, here in Brazil. This book , as a tipical pseudo-historic book, puts some real things.Even with some real things, all are used as a cover to frauds and bigoted anti-catholic absurds. A tipical anti-catholic absurd is the claim in this book, that Pius XII was a racist, using the "fact" that this Pope claimed that any "Black" american soldier in Rome, because Pius XII "thought" they were rapers. Nonsense.The real allied troop full of rapers and in Italy, wasn't a black american division.It was really an arabian troop serving the De Gaulle's "Free France".This trash-book "forgets" the fact and invent an anti-catholic fraud. In fact, Pius XII was an eugenics' foe. The opposite was true among famous protestants and jews, at that times. During the civil rights fights in USA, during 1950 decade, Pius XII showed that he was against eugenics/racism again. This trash book draws an absurd and never existed Pius XII. Who gave power to Hitler were eugenicists and communists. Pius XII ever was a Hitler's foe 
 I'm not sure why anyone would want or need a PHB2... I mean, come on.  The whole reason 3.5 came out was to make money with little regard to how to better the game, and this book follows that example very well.  The content is mostly all fluff, about the only thing redeeming about this book is the cover.  
 This was a TERRIBLE purchase on my part.  It doesn't even deserve 1 star.  I just wanted a small bag to wear over the shoulder for quick access to my z7590 without holding other equipment or being too bulky.  The bag was too small for my z7590, and I paid $8 shipping PLUS return shipping.  I only hope they don't charge me a re-stocking fee. I went to WalMart, found a cute little bag in the electronics dept. that the camera fits great in, with room for the strap AND extra memory cards or battery if necessary.  They have cute ones for ladies too, with pink polka dots or stripes inside!  For only $12.  Next time, I'll be smarter!  
 Je suis un peu du par cet album... c'est morne, le son est pas top... a trane dans les longueurs... bref ennuyeux! mais bon il faut se mettre  l'poque aussi! a  qd mme 13 ans 
 I really like my electric toothbrush from OralB so I thought I would like this too. However, it just doesn't work. The cartridges they have set up don't work because as soon as you tug on them at all, the floss becomes loose and therefore won't vibrate - it only vibrates if it's taut. But because of the way they have the cartridges set up, there is no way to make it taut again. It would have worked if instead they had used a roll of floss and let you feed it through yourself as needed, but they were too greedy and wanted to sell lots of cartridges.  This would be ok if you got lots of use out of the cartridges, but in my experience they broke halfway through a single use. So... forget it 
 I have had this textbook now for 3 years.  Sure it contains the basics, but it is now rather out of date, with a bad lay-out.  As a university student I have found it the most useless of all of the 12 marketing textbooks that I own 
 Ahh, so the illustrious Robert Jordan has graced us with a prequel.  Great.  More Wheel of Time to digest.  So how was it?  Honestly, it wasn't that bad of a book.  Much shorter than his usual efforts, the pace moved along faster than his later WOT installments (for the most part), and some interesting stuff in there about the end of the Aiel War, Lan's part in that conflict, and his eventual meeting with Moraine.  Sadly, those storylines mentioned above occupy only the beggining and ending of the novel.  Pretty much the entire middle is filled with the same dredging, monotonous crap that ruined books 8-11: namely, women bitching at each other.  I clung to the hope that the female characters in the prequel would not be subject to the same plague of whiny, insecure, petty bickering than has infected every single woman in the later WOT books.  I was violently disabused of that notion.  Young Morainne and Suian are sad dissapointments.  They are not the young and inexperienced, yet determined and formidable women you would expect.  They are carbon copies of Elayne and Egwene - stupid, jealous, unbelievably fickle characters that make you want to scream.  And a good 1/2 of the novel regards their day to day activities in the Tower: fetching tea, worrying about the Mistress of Novices, staging sorority girl pranks, and all that other crap we've already been through with Egwene, Nyneave, and Elayne!  Get to the point!  Did the book really need to be written?  No, especially with the end of the actual series looming, and so many loose threads still to tie up.  All in all New Spring was not terrible, but I really wish RJ would focus his effort on producing a few good books to wrap up Wheel of Time.  Then maybe he can start screwing around with prequels - if anyone is still interested at that point, and the way it's going now, I would say very few would. Count me out 
 I love to read, and have all my life.  I don't know how I escaped reading "Mary Poppins" as a child, because I read nearly every other children's classic book.  I decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because I hadn't read it.  I was horrified as the book went on...if this Mary has a heart, I can't find it.  You'd have to use a microscope to find it.  Yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting.  I don't have a problem with that.  My problem is Mary  herself. She's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book.  I found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on.  Perhaps I was tainted in my viewpoint by the Disney version. But I'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book.  At least in the movie Mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something.  In the book she's as friendly as a block of ice.  Watch the movie.  Forget the book 
 This product is very expensive.  It eats filters if you`re on well water.  I have to clean the unit more frequently then is normal--everytime i change the water, and the filters, when they work, need to be changed once a week at $.13.88 a pop.  i bought this to avoid having to buy distilled water,  but  that was a mistake.  It humidifies well, but I know there are better cheaper ones out there 
 Some books, in my opinion, are just plain overrated.  The characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting.  Likewise the tale.  The reader takes nothing from it. Put this in a list with Franzen's The Corrections and Frazier's Cold Mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades 
 This was a boring book. Nothing happened! The descriptions of people, places, and events were really good-unlike the plot. Basically, Thora is from some community where if you're born with the mark of the goddess, you learn how to use a limited amount of magic, and don't have to get married or take care of the home. The community is attacked by pirates, but Thora and her dog escape. Thora finds a wounded familiar, and they travel together. They find an underground storage chamber thing, and go through it. There are all sorts of things there from the old days, where technology was above that of the middle ages. Thora and Malkin and Kurt go to the place where Malkin's blood-bonded person is, they fight some evil people, blah, blah, blah. The thing I didn't like about this book was that nothing really interesting happens. They have battles, but the battles aren't realistic, even for a fantasy/science fiction story. I mean, they don't know who they're really fighting, none of the bad guys ever say anything. Plus, Thora is _really_ intolerant of other people's religious beliefs and  customs. If someone doesn't go with the code she was raised with, she pretty much gives them the cold shoulder. It got on my nerves. Again, nothing happened. I liked the furry people-the familiars, and their relatives in the woods-but the people were boring. Thora's is the only view point, and she never changes her mind about any of them. Basically, it's a boring book with boring characters. I've read a few of Norton's other books, and feel pretty confident when I say that this is definately not her best work 
 As a resident who has lived in Yuma, Arizona for the past nine years and read the daily paper and watched the nightly news giving scant details about one or two bodies found here or there, presumed to be those of "illegals" -- Urrea brings to the reader the faces and lives of the human beings behind the numbers.  I often think of the deceased that are briefly mentioned in these news blurbs and wonder where they came from, whom they have left behind and what dreams of theirs did the desert kill?  And is the desert what really killed them?  Or was it some errant Border Patrol agent or a frustrated and pissed off Minuteman?  Just what are they so pissed about, anyhow?   Regarding the immigrants and their motivations for leaving their beloved behind for the north, Urrea certainly answered some of my questions.  No, America, they are not all criminals, drug runners or people out to get your top jobs!  They just want to make enough to feed their families and if they're lucky, save enough to buy a little building material for a house or to start up a small business.  I have yet to hear any of my friends or acquaintances get excited about applying for jobs in agriculture or plucking chickens!   This book should be recommended reading for our government leaders, the INS, and ALL law enforcement agencies - they might just be able to figure out a plan for immigration reform!  Just be sure to read the interview of Mr. Urrea in the Reading Group Guide at the end of the book -- the numbers (profits) will amaze you.  As this book painfully demonstrates, fences are not going to do anything but make death in the desert an even more certain fate for crossers.   Thank you, Mr. Urrea, for giving the world a clear and concise picture of what is really going on in our corner of the country and our part of the globe, for that matter.  As I drive along I-8 going to either San Diego or Phoenix and offer my usual prayer for those who have died so close by, I can promise that the names of Edgar, Abraham, Jose and Reymundo will not be forgotten.  I will even have a prayer for Mendez.      
 I am totally discusted with this CD. I bought it for one song "The  Birth of the Beat" - A wonderful 10 minute performance. When I played  it, I found out it was a cut down version (3 minutes). Needless to say, I  am extremely disappointed 
 SimpleTech claims that this reader is Mac compatible, but it freezes up my Mac (OS 10.4.7) with every attempt to use it.  I have two other card readers that work perfectly on my Mac with the same SD cards inside them.  SimpleTech tech support tells me that they never tested this reader with Lexar SD cards because "they're not one of the bigger card makers."  Makes me question how serious they are about determining compatibility 
 This operating system was one of the most unsatisfactory I have ever used--including DOS, Win 3.1, Windows 95 and Windows 98.   Aside from being incompatible with older hardware, XP Home Edition crashes frequently-particularly if you like to work with several windows open at once.   Most important, the program is highly susceptible to viruses and hackers. Preventing these two problems requires expensive add-on software and hardware.   True enough, the built-in firewall OUGHT to work. But in my case, hackers got in anyway. I had to hire an expensive data recovery guru-another story in itself.   Even reinstalling the program did not solve the problem. My computer was completely compromised. I was eventually forced to junk the machine.   After my dreadful experience with XP Home Edition, I have sworn off Windows forever. Mac and Linux are both far superior 
 As you see, there are reviews giving this book both good and bad reviews - the good ones praise its organization and readability, the bad ones point out its errors. There are indeed a fair number of errors, which is bad enough, but I found many explanations confusing and misleading - perhaps because I have 3 years experience with security, and 15 with networking. Organization is all very well, but to make an analogy, a well-written tour guide to Denmark is of little help in finding your way in France! Skip this one!! 
 Like many other reviewers, I struggled with this book. For more than 600 pages, Anna Wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life. This might be an interesting book for fiction writers, who might understand the elaborate process Anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art. But for the average reader, this is just too much and too long.  I am very patient with novels. Perhaps too patient, because I should have put this one down sooner. I got all the way to page 500 before I realized I just couldn't go on. And it's quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down. Doris Lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with. I should have taken her advice sooner. But while some books you might not just be 'ready' for, I don't think I will ever be ready for this one.   It's disappointing because I am a Doris Lessing fan. The Four-Gated City explores many of the same themes - an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you. Anna Wulf did have a fragmented mind, as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks. She was kept together by the routines of her life, such as making breakfast for her daughter. When she didn't have anything constructive to do, she thought herself to death. And if you read this book, you'll likely be right there with her - going crazy. 
 This guy obviously didn't graduate high school and either did his editor. (His dog perhaps?)  Stupid examples with no relevence.  No question that he is a racist, for many of his examples use names normally attributed to black people.  Don't know what else to say, but it is the worst book I have ever opened, by a mile 
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 It is my fault I chose to purchase this book, thinking it would be useful to me. "Instant Analysis" gives you what is says on the tin. A shallow analysis on how to deal with different issues , one faces in life. It sounds more like those teenager magazines with different "tips" on how to improve your life than a serious work that may help you with something. Unfortunately, I have to say it is not worthy 
 Ghyka attempts to show the objects in nature are not randomly formed; he begins the with the concept of ratio and proportion in the plane; the golden section; and then to the regular polygons and geometric shapes in 3 dimensions.  Then he rambles onto hypothesizing why an architecture design may seem striking. In doing so he makes gross assumptions which are to the point of being forced to fit his theories.  The basic concepts that he delves; one can familiarize oneself with by a quick reference on the internet. Hence I do not recommend spending the time and money to read this book.  
 These CliC glasses are a great idea... I first saw them on CSI-NY, and sought them out, but they are not made big enough... they worked fine as long as I was looking down, but as soon as I turned my head level, or looking up, the glasses would "pop" apart.  I had purchased two pair, and returned them both 
 After finishing the 70-290 book in the set and taking the exam, I am shocked at how "out of touch" this book is with the actual exam.  Topics that were barely touched upon in the book ended up being huge sections in the test and vice versa.  I started buying Sybex cert books because of how well the CCNA book was done and how it actually related to the exam.  I'm hoping the other books in this kit are a little more up to par 
 "Just Enough" is more than enough:  A turgid, pretentious, strident, and wholly unoriginal piece of work.  Its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior, nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self-help pop-business literature. At best, this might have been a reasonable ten page article in the Harvard Business Review, but surely not enough material for 280 pages!  Better to read "Do What You Love, The Money Will Follow : Discovering Your Right Livelihood," by MARSHA SINETAR, and call it a day 
 I read this book, and I must say, it seems that the only thing she likes is Pantene, and other like products. On every other page there is a reference to a product, but how Pantene is better. Are you kidding me!!!! Yuck! I think she seriously got paid off on this one. Cover to cover advertisements for a damaging horrrible product 
 I was excited to get this book because of the great reveiws it received.  But I quickly became dissapointed.  The beginning started off good and had lots of promise to be an exciting and enjoyable read...but after I read 40 pages still nothing exciting happened.  It took forever for the two main characters to get together, I was bored with them.  And I really got sick of hearing about all the friends and their boring lives.  Usually I love Susan Elizabeth Phillips's novels.  My favorites being Kiss an Angel and Dream a Little Dream 
 This album was a bit disappointing. I listen to a lot of jazz, blues and electronica but I call this Musak (aural wallpaper). Spend your money instead on Glide by New York Eletric Piano or the new Metheny Mehldau album 
 I found the cover deceiving.  I thought the book would be filled with fun designs and better instruction for the home baker attempting to improve their presentation skills.  I was also not happy with the icing recipes I tried.  I do not recommend this book 
 Like the reviewer before me, I too was very disappointed in this dvd. The clips that have sound are terrible. Most of the clips were from the silent film era, and the players were unfamiliar to me. There was one clip with Alfalfa and Spanky that was fun to watch, but the majority of these clips was awful. No effort was put into digitally re-mastering and transfering the picture and sound. I could have done just as good of a job transfering these clips using just a VCR and a DVR. Don't waste your money on buying this disc. It is a shame, because with a little effort these clips could of had much better quality and it would have been more fun to watch these vintage clips 
 Although this book is packed with great words...it is not a good reference book.  I will be sending it back, and search until I find that one , fabulous thesaurus... 
 I only read two chapters of the book before I stopped reading. I found these chapters full of clichs and sensationalized stories (at least they appear to be). They also lacked original work and rely too much on other references. As an African, I've read many such stories and I feel that such type of books fail to give one a good understanding of the continent that I know. They just reinforce the stereotypical image westerners have about Africa. If you are expecting a good and honest travel narrative book, this is not it. Don't waste your money or time.  
 Objective?  The reviewer that called this book 'objective and factual' wasn't reading the same book I read.  Factual perhaps, but objective...no way.  There are so many good points in this book, but they get lost amid the nasty digs and political slant.    The insinuation that the misery and insecurity that women's magazines shovel is part of some large liberal conspiracy is laughable.  The author is guilty of what she accuses her liberal media colleagues of doing.  The message is a mixed one; you are woman therefore you are strong and powerful yet blame the liberals for all the bad messages you've been fed over the years.  Where's the empowerment in pointing fingers and assigning blame?    The driving force behind what goes into magazines is whatever sells.  You could easily argue that no one forced women to buy those magazines and read those articles.  If there's anyone to blame, we should be pointing the finger back at ourselves.  Our empowerment lies in our ability to vote using the dollars we spend or, as the case may be, refuse to spend 
 This book is unbelievably tedious and repetitious. There is very little actual content for the length of the book. It takes nearly 200 pages just to define some very basic terms from graph theory. This might have been fine if the space were taken up by some sort of meaningful discussion on the relevance of these graph theory concepts to sociological studies and theory. The book (possibly the field?) has the flavor of "here's a hammer, now what can we hit with it?".  Would have liked to see a format based on justification of the analytic techniques from sociological principles, or something much much more concise. Nothing much to see here, move on 
 From the cover and a quick glances at some of the colorful photo filled chapters, this book seem promising at first. But the cliched saying of never judge a book by its cover has taken its toll. This book provides marginal advice on how to -potentially- make a profit from the wonderful world of digital photography, however, it fails to give any real world working model on how this can be accomplished.   Most of the marginally useful advices and sales model, i.e. pricing structure on stock photos, are based on the author's own personal preference and experience, rather than taking into account the wide breadth of pricing methods that exist in the real world of photography.  This is a great book for amateurs that are trying to break into the business of selling their prints from an outline or a strict table-of-content perspective of the available methods and channels of distribution to target, e.g. card stock, stock photo, art fairs, etc.   Most of topics cover seem to be more 'theoretical' than actual real-world hands down information and the author seems to expend more time, energy and care in expressing his disdain (with a condescending overtone, might I add) toward enthusiastic amateurs that aim to make it big and quick. His favorite recurring adjectives for such amateurs includes, but certainly are not limited to: prima donnas, pretentious, and pretend aficionado. Heller may be a [self-aggrandizing] professional photographer, but anyone with such high caliber should be more helpful, than pompous or supercilious. Remember Heller, you were an amateur at one point too.  Further more, Heller likes to take a seemingly interesting idea, get your hopes up and then tell you why you shouldn't pursue it because the odds are just too high against you.  Bottomline: If you are serious about licensing your photographs for use, then this book does not really cover the core foundations that you need to get your feet wet. On the otherhand, if you want to take a look at what you can do to -potentially- make a profit from your hobby, then this book basically gives you an -general- idea.  I'd give this book a 1-star for the lack of usable information and the author's cockiness, but it does contain some interesting theories and sales model to warrant a 2-star rating 
 Nylander's semi-biographical book on New England women's history is problematic for many reasons.  Firstly, she carries the brunt of her argument on insufficient evidence...only four diaries.   In a region that's rich with historical documentation, she should easily have been able to find more evidence.  Secondly, Nylander systematically ignores issues of class or race, instead depicting a very rosy image of white upper class women as representative of all women in this time period.    At the very least, Nylander should have been more forward about her intended focus 
 It is so sad to me that the last several of the once intertaining Cat Who books have really been terrible.  I'm now on the lookout for another "series" to enjoy, and I'll only buy another Cat Who book at the dollar store 
 As an Artist (Painter) who buys many art books and counts Jenny Saville as one of his favorite younger painters, I have been eagerly awaiting this books release.  I was also fortunate enough to get the Catalogue for Saville's Territories exhibition, and not I don't want to sell it.  Considering the quality of the Territories and Migrants publications, my expectations for this book were admittedly high.  I also saw both shows in person.  As for this book, Disappointing is an understatement.  Let's start with the obvious, it is incomplete and does not contain any of her earlier work and the text is nothing new, just a collection of older stuff.  Then the reproduction quality is poor, the images are too small, the colors aren't accurate, they're overly contrasting.  This leads me to believe that someone that never saw the actual works ran the images through some Photoshop printing filter and didn't actually compare the printed images to the paintings.  In addition, the layout of the artwork in the book is just plain bad.  Instead of centering the images on the page, they hug the center, which makes them awkward to look at.  For a book publisher, this is unforgivable.  The positive aspects of the book are:  well, there's finally a book on Saville and the photos of her studies, references and studio a well done, in fact there could be more.  They do provide detail shots of her painting, which is mandatory with her work considering the scale.  However, the few positives can't make up for a very poor book overall on an important contemporary artist.  One reviewer said, "Move over Lucian Freud", I think not.  A comparison cannot be made until Saville is in her 80's, then we'll (well someone will) talk.  While her earlier work is very impressive, I'm becoming concerned about where she is going paint wise.  The earlier work has "character", the newer work and pieces from the Migrants exhibition seem slick, rushed and overly pretty.  The new work also lacks the conceptual strength of the early work (her weak point anyway).  It seems to me she's becoming a clich of herself.  The best comparison I can think of is the animation style of the early Simpsons or South Park compared to later years.  The rough edges and distinctiveness have disappeared, replaces by standardization and predictability, never a good thing for an artist.  I hope that this phase of Saville's career will pass quickly.  Final Score  4 out of 1 
 I love how someone was calling the people who thought that they "werent" the same, stupid. first of all, the person who is the center of this band is named kris, as bright eyes is conor. they have seperate last names as well! would you look at that! yeah, he does sound like conor, you have to be an earless brainless idiot to not see the similarities. dont act like youre above everyone and super obscure by saying they dont sound alike. because they do. and conor has uniquely adopted this style of music which is.. obviously being posed off of. i could see if an angle maybe used his singing style and then chose his words and writing style differently, or even music writing style, but he doesnt, he goes right with copying off of bright eyes, and that's not very creative or commendable, whether or not he is a drunk like conor or not. just because conor drinks doesnt mean he puts on any less of a good show.. here's a question.. ever been to a bright eyes show? oh, obviously not 
 This is a bubble gum type of book that does not teach anything about making money on the markets. It is a platform to sell Investor Business Daily services. If you want to learn trading look for articles written by Toby Crabel or Arthur Merrill, even Linda Raschke. They are full time professional money managers that happend to write few articles... some of them you can probably find on Ebay for cheaper... 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 I realize that this is supposed to be an introductory book, however it does not provide enough detail to be very useful in my 2nd year inorganic chem class. I am extremely disappointed by this since the book costs so much money. I wonder how much more it would cost if it was hardcover.   It does have a good layout and bright pictures and colors though. I guess this is supposed to stimulate the brain or something 
 Certainly not as interesting as I expected it to be. Boring and no "inside" insight into "the boys".  Not recommended 
 This book doesn't exactly have an original premise; a West Point graduate named Philip Dru fights for the rights of the oppressed by overthrowing the American government and implementing a benevolent dictatorship (forgive the oxymoron) so as to correct the problems of society. Such a book, while shocking at first glance, is so common that rarely would I consider it worth reading. This one, however, comes with an interesting catch... it was written by none other than Edward House. The name might not ring a bell for most people, but Colonel Edward M. House was Woodrow Wilson's closest advisor during the first six years of his presidency, and as such this book yields amazing insights into the philosophical and personal character of a man who was one of the most powerful in the nation (and, for a brief period of time, in the world). For that alone it deserves to be read. It suffers, however, from House's own shortcomings as a writer. The prose is pedestrian, the dialogue cliched and trite, the narrative development utterly predictable (and often unrealistic), and the explanations and analysis given to major problems of the day simplistic and absurd. Indeed, it is amazing that a man of Wilson's great intellect and brilliant insights would have ever associated with, much less trusted, someone who could write something so poor. The fact that Wilson was one of our greatest presidents is a wonder, given the content of this book; aside from its historical significance, it has no redeeming value. 
 Rarely have so many pages been used to convey so little information. This is a very superficial treatment of many subjects. This book offers very little in making language interesting.  I bought this book after reading a review in the New York Times which made it sound interesting. After looking through this book, I suspect the reviewer was put up to writing a favorable review. If you think this book might be interesting, borrow a copy and inspect it before buying. 
 I'm sorry, but this book was nothing more than an obvious attempt to "cash in" on the recent King Kong craze.  Overblown and overwritten, this book offers nothing that hasn't already been covered in every other Kong book.  Only the other books did it better.  This one is boring and lifeless, and seems to have been written by someone who's never even bothered to watch a King Kong movie.  Don't waste your time on this rip-off.  I took my copy to a second-hand book store and unloaded it.  Blah!   
 I chose this book because I have long been interested in the Salem Witch Trials. I really enjoyed the parts of the story which dealt with Kim's search for the truth of her ancestor' role in the tragedy. I'll admit that I mostly skimmed the parts which dealt with Kim & Edward's relationship---as characters, they are totally unbelievable and not very likeable.  The part I found most surprising was Kim's attitude towards medications, especially considering that she is a nurse. The drug research storyline was so, eh, I don't even have a word for it. Not worth reading. The interactions between the characters in the book are stilted and painful. I think we are supposed to feel sympathy for Kim's social awkwardness & anxiety, but really you just want to shake her and tell her to grow a backbone already. As much as I love reading, I can not  recommend this book to anyone. 
 Should have been remastered but at that price I enjoyed crooning to my favorite lyrics 
 I liked Confessions of a Shopaholic and I like the main character Becky, but this book goes a little too far into la la land for any of it to be real.  In C of a S, I could follow Becky's reasoning and obsessive shopping mentality.  Throw that into wedding planning and the author seemed to be making up completely unrealistic situations.  I couldn't identify with Becky anymore and kept turning the page wanting it to end.  And after everything, of course it ends perfectly.  It was a quick read, but it lost that fun and identifiable-ness that the original book possessed 
 NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)!  Not liking the negro portrayal in GONE WITH THE WIND,Alice Randall therefore created her own version, a parody of the acclaimed southern classic.Therein lies the problem.  The trouble with parodies,it so intertwind with the original that it can be used as a sequel,a retelling or a new story with characters copied from the original but this time superior while degrading the original.So much so,readers begin to accept these false truth as the true truth.Not openly but in disguise, words like "what if" & "perhaps".Why?Because people always like scandals to famous chracters fiction or not.When that happen, a novel,even w/ the purest intent and purpose,gets butchered.  Here are some cases to prove my point & where the book failed:  1.THE PARODY/CONCEPT ITSELF-The whole purpose of this book is to show negroes aren't dumb and capable.If you read GWTW,as others call it"White-washed"&"Romantized",is in fact a love story.Plus Mitchell was trying to show how a civilization changes after a war,what better way to illustrate it than the old south?  But why portray negroes like that? Obviously these fools didn't see Aunt Pitty,Hugh Elsing or Ashley.Aren't they white,helpless,pathetic and idiots?  If you read GWTW, What about the courageousness&modesty of Pork,The industriousness &loyalty of Dilcey?What about Uncle Peter who single handly raised Charles&Melanie,who looked after and Protected Aunt Pitty?What about Rhett and Scarlett declaring Mammy as a smart old soul?Aren't these persons Negro and admirable traits?  2.MAMMY KILLING THE 3 SONS-In p.663 GWTW, a yankee tells Scarlett "do you think i can trust my babies to a negro?" She thought otherwise,and now Mammy kills Gerald's sons.Its thesame as saying negroes can't be trusted and they kill white babies and Randall was trying to show Negroes in a different light.This damages her&the book's credibility.Noble as her intent,but no good can come out of evil means.Its better to kill 10 people than 1 baby,as the saying goes.  3.GERALD/MAMMY-Check the background story of Ellen/Gerald.There can be no doubt of his fidelity.It takes a great deal of emotion for a person to get unhinged after a loved one's death.  4.CYNARA-She is an exact copy of Scarlett even their ages are thesame but this time she smart,beautiful,brown,a good mother compared to Scarlett.She even has Scarlett's strength & Rhett even prefers her.Ridiculous!if Rhett likers her than Scarlett he would've married her instead,or divorce scarlett after he have is way with her,Rhett boast of being ill-bred so his rep. wont matter.Why this nonesense of mistress and after death marriage?  The book,despite being well-written,feels like a parasite after reading created by a first-time author who wants instant fame,fortune making others accept and embrace that her work is better while destroying others hard work. If you want a book about the attrocities of slavery then buy UNCLE TOM's CABIN which is BETTER than this one.  NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)! 
 I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.  These binoculars are crystal-clear, with sharp focus. The 42mm lens lets in lots of light, lots more than the 35's I've been using. I wear glasses and the twist- up- and -down eyecups are a blessing. There are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm, nice because I always used to lose them.  For the price, these can't be beat 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 The author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the Chamber of Commerce or a right-wing think tank. Like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. In his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. He is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. He finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. His low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. Most in the West do care. Rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment.   Though the author's real target is US society, he looks at the results of democracy over the world. And of course, he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. A country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. But it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the US.   In the US, the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. In actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. In this era, elites in finance, business, law, banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. He contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. It is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at Wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. The actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the Wal-mart juggernaut.   He especially decries direct citizen actions. He is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. However, he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. It's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of Congress to accumulate vast sums. If citizens had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. The theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as American as apple pie. His view that such unelected bodies as the Supreme Court and the Federal Reserve Board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. Who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the Fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? No, rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not buttressed it.   If the author put journalism first, instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process, actually foiling democracy. First and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. It is not surprising that Americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs, massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting of our manufacturing base, etc. The list could go on. Informed, empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. The US most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. This is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore.   It is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. Americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. Yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if need be. The book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.  
 Disappointing. This book is not particularly well-written. Heller waxes majestically about the scenery and topography he sees, but I still can't visualize it. And he shifts his voice several times throughout the book, sometimes writing as if he were delivering sacred text, other times casually reaching out and attempting to speak to the reader one-on-one. It's hard to get a feel for the story he's trying to tell. Add that to the fact that there is not a single compelling character in the book and it makes it a little tough to slog through. I find that I just don't care what happens to these people. And this may sound silly, but an adventure book without pictures of the location is a bad idea. I hate to sound like I'm in 4th grade, but it would have been really helpful to have some visual aids to understand the geography they were in and the effect of the water on their kayaking. No photos. It hurts the book 
 A friend who knows my taste in music recommended VNV Nation to me, so I got Matter + Form based on the reviews.  In one sense I like it.  The production is excellent and I find every track to be creative and unique.  But I HATE the vocals and so I can't bear to listen to the CD.  This dude has the worst voice in music history.  
 Even Bob's many building talents could not deal with this problem.  We could not be more disappointed.  Like the previous reviews say, it falls apart constantly.  You cannot play with one area without having your child ask you to fix some other part that has just collapsed or doesn't fit properly.  This was a waste of money.  I expected better given that the actual character vehicles are a lot hardier and can withstand alot more play 
 What does it mean when someone gets excessively-defensive? It doesn't express that they have peace or comfort with themselves.  Writing sludge like this just fuels the fire - that I suppose they are trying to put out. If .. there .. WAS .. ever .. a .. fire. 
 This is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. This book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. A complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. Take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book I've ever purchased. 
 What a depressing book. If you can get past all the charts and graphs, the basic message of the book seems to be "Don't Gamble!" And if you do, you aren't going to win because everything is stacked against you. I got plucked good in buying this turkey. 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS 
 I'm not sure who wrote the positive reviews here, but I can tell you as a student using this book that it is among the worst I've ever been stuck with and most of my classmates seem to agree.  The concepts are made much more difficult than they should be by poor writing.  The authors jump around constantly, use new terminology at times before introducing it, and provide examples that are inadequate in helping to solve the problems at the end of the chapter.  Stylistically, the writing is very bland and sure to put you to sleep.  The first sentence of the book is "This is a book about signals and systems."  Sure, this book may cover all of the core concepts involved in signal processing, but trying to make sense of it when you don't already have a background in the subject is quite a challenge.  After reading the chapters, we were unable to solve most of the problems in the book until given the answers were given to us.  I've dealt with bad textbooks before, but this one tops them all.  Needless to say, it was very frustrating experience and I can't say I recommend this book 
 This movie didn't do anything for me...Didn't care for the characters or the plot.  The ending was disapointing also.  
 This was required reading for my 15 year old son and he said: It was boring 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 I borrowed Changing Minds from the library looking for a foray into the science of altering opinion. The book is mostly write ups that are not supported.As other reviews say 'where is the proof? 
  To be honest, I do pick up this Mag from the Newstand 4 to 5 times a year, but I can hardly call myself a fan. If you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag, Wired is not for you, It tries too hard to be hip and trendy, but it's group of Left/Lib Nerds too often come off as being lame and borish.  Wired needs to be "ReWired" to meet the needs of the modern tech community 
 Good treatice on stating the obvious but light on meaningful detail and depth into particulars 
 This was one of the volumes in the History of the American Cinema series that I was most looking forward to, and while a good book it fails to measure up to the best in the series.  Prince never seems to be able to offer the insight of Cook (in vol. 9) or the mastery of Koszarski (in vol. 3).  I had hoped for more about an era that looms as large in the public imagination as that decade does, yet Prince is unable to meet the challenge 
 It starts out like Laura Bush's Rules for Driving, but skydives after the opening pages, in which the then 17-year-old Laura kills a young man with her car, who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend!    My interest in the book sharply dove after that, as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about Laura Bush 
 While this book does appear to have a good coverage of topics, there is little to be found here that wouldn't be considered trivial by anyone who has completed a math course at the junior high level 
 Having enjoyed McCauley's first novel & read enough reviews that lead me to want to read this as a sort of lighthearted romp along the lines of a gay male 'Sex & the City', I was almost totally put off by this dreary and sour book.  The main problem for me was that almost all of the characters, including at times the narrator/protagonist, William, are so unlikeable and often unpleasant, that I found myself wanting to escape their company.  Even the 'object of his affection,' Edward, is so sulky and petulant throughout the book, that one cannot really root for or even care whether they get together.  The non-rent paying tenant Kumiko; the belligerent self help guru, Marty; the effete Belgian, Didier; the arrogant perfumer, Sean; the bulldozing fellow agent, Deirdre, and on and on  - all of these characters are so meanspirited and nasty that the book is a downer.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that it is also self-consciously a 'post-9/11' novel, but to wallow in such misery is more than I could take for the few chuckles the book elicited... be warned 
 President Clinton's autobiography reads as a near endless series of events rehashed from his diaries.  It frequently appears as though the brief, daily notes and events were simply written into complete sentences with some emotion or perspective added.  It does provide an extensive recap of President Clinton's life events, so if that's of interest you may want to check it out 
   Wow.  What happened?  The spirit of Helfgott swirls around the hyped-up, amateur "stylings" of cLand cLang. At least Liberace stayed in Las Vegas (Mr. cLang, there is a casino in your future.) Please, Sir, I beg of you, Listen to the masters who have gone before you!  Give some credence to the notes as they are written on the page. Since you have won the jackpot--having been christened a star irrespective of talent--at least try to stand on the shoulders of the giants whose brilliance light the world.    I suppose it takes all of one's time and energy to feed the publicity machine.  But be warned: the hypsters will soon feel the need to inflict another "star" on the world. Can you tell yet that I'm not a fan?  Lang Lang is the Paris Hilton of classical music; all style, no substance.  Apparently, fame itself was the destination and in that sense LL has certainly arrived.    
 In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.  If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.  The first chapter is written in a maudlin, "those-were-the-good-old-days" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say "Erin Go Braugh" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.  Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as "It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism," or "they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism." These "Morris mind-reads" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.  Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!  But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.  Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.  Benjamin Franklin said "Statistics is a liar." Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.  Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in "Moby Dick," we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: "I caught a fish this big!"  There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.  In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!        
 i buy this telephone with 6 optional phones to all my rooms but is the third time i have to buy the main phone base because it only last aproximately 2 1/2 years and because of the investment i have in the 6 phones i have to be buying the main base again and again 
 the dolls are made from very good paper, very sturdy. And I have to say I like the design of the clothes whereas they have a front and back that fold over the dolls.  The dolls themselves are very pretty. The details are very nice but the dresses are just not very pretty.  My girls and I expected fairy tales dress but got a little too woodsy ones. the colors are really quite dull- a lot of browns and greens.  Pretty pastels or bright colors like flowers would have been better.  The best thing we can do is mabey make our own dresses.  Sorry, can not recommend this to anyone. I would not have wasted my money it if I had seen it in a store first 
 After all the Hype about this game I bought it...well in my opinion it just felt flat on its face. The game simply is not very intersting and the storyline can be plain boring. There are other RPGs out there that are better and you simply get immersed in the story line quickly. The battles get boring extremely quickly since all you do is kinda point and tap the same guys over and over. The "costumes" and "decals" are kinda stupid. Many said this was the next EARTHBOUND, well is NOT and not even close. The Nintendo DS has so much potential and this game does not deliver in graphics, sound , game play and fun. dont get me wrong the game is not horrible by any means but defitnetly not that good either. check out some reviews out there before you buy it 
 Generally speaking, some tips here work, some not so much, whilst others are good for a laugh.  The only situation where I found this book can be useful is when you have debt up to your a#s and need to pay it off fast.  Then this book will be a good book for you to read.  Reason: any money you can put toward debt reduction represents 100% risk free and tax free return on your investment (much like a strip bond).  This could include mortgage debt as well.  In the real world this book is less than practical.  For example, the book recommends invest your spare cash at a mutual fund.  This is where you could get killed if you just blindly throw money at your fund without knowing what you are doing.  How would you feel if you cut off the cap of your tooth paste to save a couple of penies, then at the end of a month finds out that you just lost 5% of your net worth in your mutual fund ??  If you are like most people I know, you might say something like this: well, I haven't lost any money because I have not sold, then a month later, you find out you lost another 3% ??  Say if I tell you we are going into a bear market, do you have the courage to short the market ?? how much are you willing to risk in your investment ??  What about giving to your local charities ?? THESE ARE THE REALITIES, folks, not how many pennies you can saved.  Get used to it.  The fact is, a skillful investor and / or trader can make the money 10 times more, much more so than the technics presented in this book 
 This is a good book for those scientists who are really, truly hiding under a rock, but will not be helpful for most others.  The book can be summed up in a few sentences: Be nice to everyone you meet. Do good work. Don't allow yourself to get walked on.  Now you can move on to a book with some practical advice like "Tomorrow's Professor.&quot 
 ...not much more...for us, at least.  we were so excited by the idea of this product and the orange/burgandy colors!  but when it come down to it, we just couldn't ever adjust it comfortably enough for ourselves or the baby.  we used and liked a hand-me-down baby bjorn and "breast friend" sling much better.  sigh, such a waste of a pretty sling.  ;- 
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 This system is way too complex and takes far too much work for me.  To set up and learn to use this system would take hours for me.    And I am a visual person; out of sight out of mind.  I was looking for helpful suggestions and really didn't find anything that was beneficial.  I am disappointed in this book 
 Anyone giving a four star review to this is kidding themselves. Its a total dog's breakfast. I'm a Dylan fanatic. I love all but the bottom two or three albums of his catalogue, which I consider Planet Waves to be among. The song-writing is half-baked: the lyrics aren't profound, they're cobbled hurrily together. The Band just aren't tight. They're not playing together. Each song is like a drunken person stumbling: you keep thinking they're going to fall over, and they try really hard to hold themselves together but it doesn't really work. That's the truth about Planet Waves, like no-one else here'll tell you.  doesn't do justice to the album's enduring track Forever Young 
 This book appears to be the " book" from "MUSIC MAN  from the way it is listed.  It is not however.  It consists of songs from the show with melody line only printed in extra large notes. Each note contains  the name of the pitch writen inside.  It is only marginally useful as a  teaching tool for children and is defintely not what it appears to be in  the Amazone Catalogue! 
 I always thought 'Back to the heavyweight jam' was crap, but this cd has proven me wrong. Hardly any good songs what so ever. The single 'I'm your pusher' is probably the best song on the cd but not any good compared to scooter's earlier work. I myself am a big scooter fan and i own all of their albums, but this is just bad. If you wanna listen to good german dance music i recommend scooters earlier albums like: 'No time to chill',  'Wicked!',  'Our happy hardcore', '..And the beat goes on', 'The age of love' and their singles album; 'Rough and tough and dangerous'. Buy one of these instead of 'Sheffield' and their second newest album; 'Back to the heavyweight jam' 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 I bought an O'Reilly book to teach myself perl & it was great. I'm writing a review about this one because I'm frustrated. The first six chapters go by like a breeze for folks familiar with other programming languages (I use perl, mel, c, html, studio). well, that's not entirely true. I couldn't get my apache server to execute any of my php code (I'm on a new mac mini). I followed all the instructions in appendix A to no avail. Finally, I just uploaded my php scripts to a webserver & my code worked there. but that's super annoying because I have to upload my php file every time I want to test it (& sometimes my internet connection is slow). whatever. anyway: when I got to chapter 7 none of the examples worked anymore & it is extremely vague exactly how you're supposed to run some commands. for example: if you want to set up a database, you run the following command only one time:  CREATE TABLE dishes (     dish_id INT,     dish_name VARCHAR(255),     price DECIMAL(4,2),     is_spicy INT )  but where do you run it from? also, the book relies heavily on using extensions that weren't installed in my version of php. additionally, I'm not sure if certain examples are just there to demonstrate what should work, or things that actually work. ie: this code is supposed to connect you to a database:  require 'DB.php'; $db = DB::connect('mysql://penguin:top^hat@db.example.com/restaurant');  is that actually supposed to work, or is it just an example? if it doesn't work for me (which it didn't), then I have to figure out what's wrong w/my system etc.  another frustrating this is the book recommends using several commands (like running system commands) that my webserver doesn't allow for security reasons. this problem should at least be addressed in the book. hopefully, I'm not just frustrated with php itself because several of my coworkers swear by it. but I've had more luck tracking down answers to very basic questions online than finding them in this book 
 Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend 
 Lacks any gripping force and it is an effort to work thru i 
 Most of the reviews here simply don't give you the correct concept of this thing, and i have read them all.  As a piece of hardware, it's fine. The note paper is 6" x 9." I haven't tried to find that yet, so i can't speak to the complainers, but I think i should be able to find it, and if i can't, i will go to kinkos or somewhere and have them cut me a pile of pads.  that being said, i will probably NEVER need another pad because the software with this bad boy is so horrible, it's nearly indescribable.  What were they thinking? I know: they were thinking this: "We Taiwanese guys know how this stuff should REALLY work. We don't care how EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE WORLD WORKS, we have BETTER IDEAS."  And so, let me tell you, that you absolutely CANNOT upload files from your tablet in any comprehensible way. Each page is a file, but that DOES NOT MEAN you can simply upload them and work with them.  A camera, a memory stick: these just plug into your usb port or hub, and WORK. This gizmo DOESN'T. It plugs in, gets detected, but looks like an EMPTY CD/DVD DRIVE. You click on the device, and it ASKS YOU TO LOAD A DISK.  When you try to use the outlandish software provided - even after downloading the latest and greatest - the "import function" WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT FIND YOUR STUFF.  In short, this software is so bad that it makes the device pretty much useless. Run away from this thing which looks inviting but wastes so much of your time that you will go way out of your way to warn others, and write about it on Amazon.com.  Why two stars? I'm holding out 1 star for the next version. 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 It's not an item to write home about.  Final picture quality is usually OK but not spectacular.  The wi-fi works some days, mostly not.  If I'd known then what I know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser. 
 I feel compelled to write a review to warn people that this is a pretty disturbing book.  I thought the back cover was completely misleading.  The book is about cat death - tons and tons of cats die in horrible ways.  The descriptions are graphic.  There is not a normal relationship between a woman and her cat wherein the woman loves and grieves the cat - it is written with complete emotional distance.  If the author wasn't famous for other work I can't imagine any publisher publishing this book.  Awful doesn't do it justice.  If you want to read about cats dying, written in a completely dispassionate, matter-of-fact, "oh-well" way go for it.  Otherwise, SKIP THIS BOOK 
 The train directions are either out of date or were never correct to begin with.  The book tells you to take trains that do not exist, and then they don't even include the phone number you need to call a cab when their bad directions make you end up lost.  I can't fault the book for leaving out lots of good restaurants, but I can fault it for including some that were so bad they made me sick.  I cannot comment on everything in the book, but as a guide to restaurants, museums, and transportation it is the pits.  I have used dozens of different travel guides in my life, but this is the only one that has ever been so bad I felt it deserved a negative rating.  Do not be fooled.  If you are interested in New York's cultural sites or food that won't keep you up with heartburn, do not buy this book.  It contains nothing but misdirections, and the people leaving me negative feedback just think it's hip to be a Time-Outer 
 Dr. Shaffer attempts to address the difficult topic of data structures and fails. Consistently he glosses over important points, or does not describe the implementation of data structures (the buffer pool, for example, is especially poor) adequately and leaves the hapless student confused and frustrated. For a computer scientist who already understands the subject this book may contain a few good points. Indeed, I was able to follow the sections where I had previous training, but when I studied material new to me, I was out of luck.  If you are unlucky enough to have a university that uses this text, consider trying to find a better book to get yourself an adequate understanding of this important subject, because Dr. Shaffer's text won't do that for you 
 I have given "On Aging" to a dozen people,and made it mandatory reading in the department that I manage. Saw this one on the shelf at the bookstore and couldn't wait! Well, it's not nearly what "On Aging" is. Was he in a hurry to get something in print? Sorry, I still love the man, but this just isn't up to his standards 
 I'm not sure who kidnapped the real Delerium. Awful pop music. A real disgrace 
 This book is terrible.  The lists are disappointingly incomplete and inconsequential.  For example:  A list on tipping includes tips for restroom attendants, but it omits tips for valet parking.  In my life, I have used valet parking significantly more often than a restroom attendant.  A list of common foreign phrases omits pronunciations.  How useful is that?  Knowing the spelling of a phrase does one no good during conversation should the pronunciation of a phrase be very different from its spelling.  Basically, if one had been raised by kindly wolves in the forest, and recently dropped into modern society, this book might be marginally useful.  But anyone with a modicum of planning or forethought would have outgrown this trite little waste of words and paper by age 10 
 This book is so lightweight it could float. Read UNCLE MAX by this author and found it fresh, funny and innovative.  Well Mr. Kenry has certainly made a downward spiral with this so called novel after such great promise. The book has absolutely no in-depth characterizations, the story is totally unreal .  The book is just very amateurish.  There is some excellent gay fiction out there by some very talented writers.  This book is not one of them.  I honestly couldn't finish it.  One of the worst I've ever read. Just trying to help some of you not waste your time 
 Dr. Moats' theories have been excitedly received by politicians (particularly those with very strong conservative views) and slavishly followed by publishers.  These interests claim her work to be informed by scientific research and met by strong results.  Sadly, not only is Dr. Moats' classroom experience and research questionable, she also fails to take any notice of linguistic theory.  Most damagingly, she is an adherent to the widely discredited theory of language deficit hypothesis.  This theory, which was stunninngly debunked by Labov in the 1950s, states simply that children who speak dialects other than Standard American English lack a true language and require both remedial education and lots of phonics.  Dr. Moats seems entirely unaware of this hypothesis' thorough debunking, since she never bothers to make any kind of argument as to why she believes it to be true.  This arrogance is problematic 
 Some of the things he says are stupid, and some are just false.  None of it is very helpful.  Let me save you to cover price: "Learn to store information better, don't remember it better" 
 Out of the box we noticed the table top was warped. When you push on one side of it the other pops up.  Definately not suitable for crafts or play.  Returned it that night 
 This book could have been written in 1/4 the number of pages. The author repeats his information countless times. He has some good things to say, but saying them so many times is senseless. The layout is also counterproductive. Many times throughout the book the author refers to the Liver Detox Diet, but doesn't give that diet until toward the end of the book. Summary of the book: Take a week or so and eat/drink nothing but juiced or pureed fruits and vegetables (organic preferred) 
 An accessible story with all the elements of a Great American Novel was somehow transformed into a perverse, worst of the worst ABC Afterschool Specials. If you had not read the book, you would be unable to follow what was happening. Some of the worst directing and editing I have seen in a long time. The original Evil Dead, with all its flaws, is a better put together film than this one. This movie is flat-out painful to watch. You get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do. It all seems so random. Read the book. If you see this movie in a rental store, just move along, please, nothing to see here 
 I've read a couple other books by Bill's books and always loved them.  Great characters, great story line, involved and wonderful.  This book was missing all of that - and then some.  The main characters are SO uninteresting that I had a hard time continuing to read.  I could have cared less if the old billionaire lived or died.  Does the married eco-freak couple actually keep the baby ... WHO CARES.    The story revolves around organ transplants, the drive of an old wealthy man to procreate and cure himself, a couple fighting for the rights of the environment, a third world organ thief of a doctor, and a crazy orphan who sells himself for a living.  Yes it has promise.  No - the story line does not deliver.  Please don't buy this book.  You'll only be disappointed 
 On page 198, Mark Fuhrman writes, "When I first decided to write this book [regarding the controversy surrounding Terri Schiavo], I felt that the one contribution I could make to this case was objectivity..."  This claim, at face value, is dubious at best. Fuhrman candidly admits that he got involved in this controversy at the request of Sean Hannity, of whom Fuhrman is a frequent guest.  Hannity was, of course, an outspoken supporter of the Schindlers and has had them as guests, along with Fuhrman, on Fox News' "Hannity and Colmes."  In reading the book, I found his "objectivity" to be anything but. In chapter 12, "Possible Scenarios," he offers six speculative theories as to the events that led to Terri Schiavo's collapse.  Each scenario makes Michael Schiavo look worse than the previous, although only the last one truly suggests criminality. After offering these theories, Fuhrman concludes the chapter with "One of the above scenarios describes within a certain range of accuracy what happened to Terri Schiavo. I wish I knew which one."  This seeming fairness on Fuhrman's part is belied by the book's closing paragraph. He plainly admits he can't know for certain what happened between Michael and Terri on the day of her collapse, but Fuhrman is inexplicably convinced that Schiavo is guilty of murdering his wife: "I am worried about the other Terri Schiavos out there, the ones we never hear about.  The women who die at that hands of their husbands or boyfriends...How many men have gotten away with murder?"  For someone who claims to "have no personal investment in any particular conclusion," he is very quick to accuse Michael Schiavo of murder. It is a shame, because some of his theories seem plausible to me, which is all that saves this book from a one-star rating.  I would have preferred to give it one and half stars, but that's not possible here.  Fuhrman's pretense of fairness aside,the book is remarkably dry.  There is no warmth or humor to be found in these pages.  This aspect, along with the lengthy discussions of biological processes (explanations of bulemia, various types of physical injuries and bone scans), make much of the book read like a medical text. Moreover, this consistent tepid tone throughout the book make his clarion call to save the "Terri Schiavos" out there seem insincere. His concern simply doesn't ring true. Particularly inconsistent with his comment stating that while he didn't like Michael Schiavo much, "that doesn't mean he killed his wife."  I hadn't planned to mention this, but it is impossible for me to consider Mark Fuhrman to be a credible source of information on anything. Here is a man who first gained notoriety when he was caught lying on the witness stand during the trial of O.J. Simpson. He claimed not to have used a certain racist epithet for the previous ten years, yet tape-recorded evidence proved otherwise. When tried for perjury for this incident, he pleaded "no contest." He is also one who invoked his rights against self-incrimination (Fifth Amendment) when asked if he had ever tampered with evidence during the trial of O.J. Simpson. It is mind boggling that this man should be taken seriously 
 Usually break free product but SMASHED in Amazon delivery and then had to wait 4 weeks for credit.  BOO 
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 This book has a few pieces of useful information ... but overall there are many much better books out there about generations and how they differ (e.g., Generation Me, When Generations Collide, Generations). The authors take a spattering of information from other sources (they are not researchers or policy makers themselves), tell a few narratives, and that's about it. You are much better off buying another book on generations.   Also, notice the publisher: Focus on the Family. Thus the book is written from an explictly stated Christian perspective. For some readers this might be a bonus; others might be put off by this in a book that is not about religion 
  I got this magazine as a gift, starting a few months back.  I really can't say I'm impressed.    Admittedly, I'm much more left leaning than this conservative (sometimes very, very conservative) magazine.  Dispite my bias, I can still recognize good writing and well made points - this magazine generally lacks both.  This isn't to say that I've never seen a good point or anything, they're just fairly rare.  If you want to read a well-written, well-argued, conservative mag this isn't it 
 This CD is a great idea, but the execution is just not quite there. It would have been so helpful to have sample tracks on the Amazon site: I would have saved the money. I put it on for my 9 year old son, and after only a few minutes, he asked that I just turn it off. We flipped through the tracks to see if one suited our fancy, but the music here is just not appealing. The words are somewhat clever, but I don't see the reason for pulling in so much bilingual content- we're doing math, not Spanish.  The musical style might be good for some, but I dislike the style and the vocals. Pass on this one.  Contrast this to Beethoven's Wig by Richard Perlmutter- On that CD, the very clever lyrics are set to tunes of the masters. The vocals are not stupendous, and the instrumentals are not perfectly polished, but the whole package is so well concieved that it makes up for all of this, and the album is great overall. After all, ordinary musicians with ordinary voices can still produce fabulous results. This is not so with the "Do the math" album 
 Succinctly put, this is probably the worst science fiction book I've read, and I've read a lot of them. I'll go point by point:  1: The idea. Some may call this novel "innovative," but that is most certainly a misuse of the word. The main idea of this book is that "incest" as we now use this word is ok as long as it either 1) genetically harmless; 2) failing the first condition, does not produce babies. Incest and other such "alternative family relationships," as another reviewer so mildly put it, is not a new idea at all. Now, I am not close minded to anything, but the sort of self-serving and constant glorification of what is ultimately a bad idea even biologically speaking that Heinlein subjects his readers too is boring, unimaginative, uninformative, and frankly morbid.  2: The plot. Nonexistent. There is no dynamic to the story. Heinlen meanders from one time-frame to another with no logic to tie them all up. There is an interesting story here and there, but they serve no meaningful purpose, except to, again, glorify (and not simply justify) "alternative family relationships."  3: The characters. I haven't found any. At least none that were really interesting. There is Lazarus, who is basically a sleazeball who is rules by his two cardinal instincts entirely: survival and reproduction. There are women, who are uniformely and without exception ruled by only one of those two instincts: reproduction. Others in the book are basically filler material.  4: The writing. Atrocious. Heinlein puts too much faith in dialogue. I say too much because he can't write it. All dialogues are protracted and artificial, they are never to a point, and they all sound alike. The last point bears repeating: you can almost never tell whose speech you are reading, except when 1) someone says they want Lazarus' baby (this happens often and it's a clue that a female character must be speaking) or 2) someone reminisces about the days of yore (that's a clue to Lazarus). But the style of the speech is the same for everyone.  5. The science fiction. Nonexistent. There are references to "rejuvenation," "time travel," and space colonization. But that's about as far as we get. There is absolutely no elaboration on how, for instance, a ten-fold increase in lifespan would have affected the reproductive choices of humanity. This is particulaly puzzling since all characters in the story are of such extraordinary verility. Put two and two together: if all women have babies every year or so, and all of those babies live for a thousand years each, how long will it take you to overpopulate a planet? The answer is: hardly any time at all. Yet Heinlein never pauses to explain how the economies of his worlds continue to function and never stops to elaborate on the causes of social collapses that do happen from time to time.   Last thing. Why did I spend all this time writing a review. Because I find it troubling that so many give this book 5-stars. This is not a worthwile read. If you are interested in romance novels, go to a different section: Heinlein is probably not the best in that genre. If you are interested in science fiction with well-developed ideas and good fiction, pick up Asimov, Greg Bear, Stephen Baxter (bad writing but great science), John C. Wright, Will McCarthy, or Vernor Vinge 
 To his credit Budziszewski at the outset states the book is not intended to convince the atheist, agnostic nor the skeptic, (be the fly on the wall) For the Christian, I imagine it is a convincing read.  Unfortunately, for someone who is attempting to understand Natural Law without relying on a heavy dose of Christian homily, it is bewildering and seemingly replete with circular, self-referencing.  The author is aware of this and makes no excuses.  But this all begs the question, why write a book for people who are already convinced they are in the moral right because the Bible says so?  There even is a substantial section about Intelligent Design, a proposition so distant from a philosopher's roots and so extreme a "scientific" stance, which gives you a thumbnail measure of how objective Budziszewski's viewpoint is from his Texas school 
 Don't believe the last review.  I had mine about a month before I tossed it out the window somewhere near Charlotte, NC.  Nothing but problems, barely recieved or transmitted and was extremely weak when it did.  I actually had truckers ask me to stop transmitting because all they could hear was squealing when I keyed.  Tossed it, kept my K40 antenna, bought a Uniden Pro538W and have loved it!  Much better radio!  Don't buy anything Cobra makes 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 I am a doom and gloom type person, so I bought this book with some eagerness. However, as pointed out in some of the other reviews, the book is disappointingly superficial in its coverage of issues and lacking in scholarship. Take, for example, the section on the dangers of nanotechnology. Michael Crichton's "Prey" does an infinitely better job of detailing what nanotechnology is all about and how it might go wrong. Similarly, if you're interested in viruses running amok, buy Preston's "Hot Zone" and "Demon in the Freezer" instead as a fascinating and gripping introduction and then tackle Laurie Garrett's "The Coming Plague" for a truly comprehensive treatment of the subject. As another example, Bill Bryson's recent book does a better job of describing threats due to possible geological disasters such as volcanoes...you get the picture. I found myself wishing at every chapter that the author had given more detail and provided more background on the threats he desribes. My bottom line? If you are also a doom and gloom person, save your money and wait for the paperback; there's enough in here to keep you mildly entertained, even if none of it is particularly new. If you're not into contemplating the destruction of the earth, skip this book entirely 
 I keep running into Booksellers, Book Collectors saying "But McBride's Books Say". Please take all and any information with a grain of salt, when some of the information are just what others are saying. There are mistakes with all EXPERTS, remember the Earth is round not flat. Do research of your own, most(99.5%) of the correct information is available for free, the rest is theory. Keep that in mind 
 This movie is about a nightclub owner in Cuba shortly before Castro took power and thereafter. It is too long and tries to cover too many things. As a result, it never develops any drama or tension and the characters never develop into people you understand or care about. 
 Ever wonder for which bipolar monomaniac the Sorcerer's Apprentice worked? Now you know. Drier than Dryden, boot-licking admirer of the thief of his childhood, humorless bookworm of a dusty aristocrat, protonerd ex machina in extremis. When Continent-lazing navel-gazers concern themselves with improving society, oil your firearms. I'd rather a deep belly laugh than Mill's musings, any day 
 ive read many endtimes outlines. tcp isnt any good. go to fortbethel.com under books for much better guides. tcp put me to sleep 
 If you loved the Back to the Future trilogy and, generally speaking, time traveling extravaganzas on the silver screen... simply forget about buying this DVD. All being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie, while you try to figure out all the "time-traveling science" you've been taught so far, then space you out close to the end, leaving you totally speechless. This is not good, simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real time-traveling pros, while winding up with some abrubt, nonsense end of the movie, with absolutely no sci-fi logic at all: they simply had to eventually stop shooting, so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick, no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot. Not a sci-fi movie and not a romantic story either: look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie 
 The "Urban Legend" franchise has been pretty steady for the past couple of years. I just don't understand why this movie was made. It shifts from the slasher feel of the previous two movies and delves into a more supernatural focus. The film is pretty bad. I'm definitely a huge fan of horror movies and it doesn't take a lot to impress me but this was just mediocre.   The acting is extremely sub-par and this is especially disappointing because Kate Mara is in the cast. She delivered some pretty good roles in "Nip/Tuck" and "Jack & Bobby" but she goes through this movie, along with the rest of the actors in an incoherent storyline that shifts from scene to scene with no depth. It's hard to care about the characters at all. They just float around with seemingly no purpose. I even almost quit watching the movie halfway but being the avid horror fan I am, I had to continue.   There is only one really cool death scene that gave this movie 1 star. It involves a pretty girl and a spider. Most of the rest of the death scenes are just retreads of urban legends the characters talked about in the past two movies. The film even has a cameo scene from "Final Cut" in which a character is watching a porn on the TV.   Overall, not even worth a rental. Luckily for me, I didn't have to waste 3 bucks because it was available for free on my Comcast ON Demand. 
 It's just another "I hate religion" book.  This book is seething with "I feel guilty and I refuse to believe its my conscience given to me by God".. 
 This book is poorly written.  Unless you know Non-profit accounting, it is not written so that you will learn anything.  I'm assuming professors use this book because of the Smithville case and for no other reason.  Honestly, I do not feel the Smithville case goes along with the book very well.  The authors should have exchanged notes a little more.  Unless it is required or you are already working in non-profit accounting, I would not buy this book 
 It didn't work properly from the time it came out of the box.  The carousel wouldn't make a complete rotation, so CDs and DVDs would  get 'trapped' inside the unit.  And occasionally, it would simply refuse to play a DVD altogether.  Panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop, so maybe they can get it to function as it should.  If you do purchase one, please read the warranty carefully;  a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one.  Panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones, under any circumstances.  
 I could plainly see that the action scenes were done in front of a green screen and I could tell exactly when there were 3D animations used.  It was that bad.  It definitely was not seemless.  Milla Jovovich was probably the worst actor for the lead roll.  She could not pull off that tough woman act.  Her acting was over-exaggerated (badly) and it was trying too much to be the matrix and Aeon Flux.  The acting was terrible by most of the actors and the actions scenes were so fake that it was unenjoyable.  I am currently watching the scene where she is talking to the little boy as he stands on the rail.  Wow!  What horrible acting 
 ... Tyrese Gibson, for WORST ACTOR EVER.  Up to this point, I've been a huge Paul Walker fan for his comedically bad acting.  He's made a career of it.  In this one, his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word "bro" at least 75 times (to give his character street cred), and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops - it's clear Walker is deeply considering his plight.  But really Walker can't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of Tyrese Gibson.  My god where did they find this guy?  The movie would've been OK as a standard, mindless action film, but it really was ruined by the 6th grade drama club acting.  Now you might be wonderning: who's the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie?  But wait, there's actually method to this madness.  Since their was no Vin Diesel, the director knew he had only Paul Walker left.  And it's well known that Walker cannot carry a film (see "Timeline").  So what to do?  Of course!  Find an actor EVEN WORSE than Walker and cast them together!  All of the sudden Walker doesn't look so terrible, because everyone's focusing on this other chump.  And apparently it worked, because a lot of people enjoyed this film, and there's even a sequel.  
 After many years, I decided to finally give Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan series a go.  So, where better to start than her debut novel 'Deja Dead' which introduces Reichs' heroine.  Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist working in Montreal for what I'm guessing is the French-Canadian equivalent of a Medical Examiner's office.  Of course our heroine is head strong, independent, and unlucky in love (aren't they all?).  Well, some murders start turning up and, amazingly enough, our intrepid anthropologist is the only person that links the crimes together.  Do the police believe her?  No, so she must investigate the crimes on her own.  And by doing so, the murderer then turns his attention to Brennan and her family and friends (don't all killers eventually do that?).  First off, the book is bloated.  The book (at least the paperback version) clocks in at about 530 pages.  Reichs' writes too much about menial tasks that her character, Brennan, does during her usual day.  Does anyone really want to hear repeatedly about what a character had for dinner or what paperwork she does at work?  I know I don't want to read it.  Now I'm a person who enjoys a nice, long book but 'Deja Dead' (where did she get that title anyway?) is about two hundred pages too long.  And it is a very slow read.    Secondly, her main character, Brennan, just isn't likeable.  In fact, I found her quite annoying.  The policemen in the novel are portrayed as incompetent, arrogant jerks who are too worried about being right than they are about doing the right thing.  When in fact I think that they just didn't want to deal with this overly nosy anthropologist who is obviously stepping on toes and irritating people who are just trying to do their jobs.  Reichs' tries to portray Brennan as a lone crusader fighting against all these odds to get to the criminal.  When in fact she is an irritating anthropologist who has no business investigating a murder.  She is, basically, a laboratory-based employee who should not be in the field.  So I don't blame the cops in the book that don't like her.  She's butting her nose in where it doesn't belong and, in a part I actually liked, she ends up bringing irreparable damage to her family and friends.  I thought it a just outcome.  Also, after about the twentieth time of Brennan looking at some cop's rear end and saying "I like the way his butt looks...Oh, stop!  You need to get laid." I wanted to scream.  Dr. Brennan, at least in this debut novel, is extremely irritating.  Thirdly, I have read the basic plot of this book in a hundred other novels.  The suprise "switcheroo" ending is not suprising but more annoying...  It is just a cheap way to trick the reader.  And if I have to read about one more main character who ends up becoming the target of the "killer", I will scream.  Its pathetic.  How many times does it need to be written?  Its ridiculous.  Now, 'Deja Dead' is the first of Reichs' books that I've read.  I've heard that the following books in the Brennan series are better and I certainly hope this is the case.  I really didn't like the book:  not the characters, the plot, the writing...  But I will give Reichs another try and read the next book in the series.  If its as bad as 'Deja Dead', I don't think I ever read another one her books 
 Jack Rakove certainly knows a lot of history about the founding fathers.  Perhaps he knows too much.  For the wealth of information in his brain has left him confused.  It has left him confused about the meaning of the constitution.  And it has led him to believe, since the meaning of the constitution is so hard to divine, that it actually has no meaning, and therefore we must be at the mercy of judges to mete out justice.  This is poppycock.  No, worse, it is dangerous.  I am not claiming that explication of original intent is easy.  But just because something is hard is not sufficient reason to abandon the project.  We owe it to ourselves to be governed by laws as they were understood at the time they were written.  If those laws are insufficient for today's needs, then they need to be amended by legislative processes, not tailored by a particular judge's sense of justice.  I wonder if Jack Rakove is actually persuaded by his own ideas, or whether a better description would be simply that he is complicit in the theft of our constitution by today's legal theorists.  I think that if you could really burrow into the depths of a persons soul, you'd find the answer is the latter.  Because I think Jack Rakove is actually a smart guy 
 I bought this book because I really do believe that U2 represent something very significant in terms of spirituality. I hoped the book would be as inspiring as U2 themselves or at least partly so. How wrong I was. This random collection of sermons feels like I'm stuck in high school english class listening to person after person rattle off speech after speech, wishing they were anywhere else but here. There is not a shred of revelation or conviction in any one of them. I kept reading hoping it would get better but it didn't. I'm very relieved that the people offering up these sermons are not preaching in my church. This is textbook preaching 101. Powerless and impoverished 
 My school district has recently changed our middle school from homogeneous grouping of classes to heterogeneous based mainly on the  works of Ms. Oakes.  The effects have been disastrous to say the least with large numbers of misplaced and failing lower achievement level students.  After reading "keeping Track" I came to the conclusion that Ms. Oakes has not spent much (if any) time teaching actual K-12 classes.  If you are a teacher in the real world you will probably agree with my assessment.  Her conclusion that we should all just merrily follow the model of cooperative learning (she gives no actual successful examples of how this will really improve learning) and it will fix everything , just reinforced my belief that she basically doesn't know what she is talking about.  Unfortunately many school districts have become followers of her teachings and have radically changed their structures to  heterogeneity.   Of course, Ms. Oakes has made money and these school districts have saved a bundle on this philosophy.  I recommend reading this book if for no other purpose than to open your eyes to the dangers of listening to the purveyors of ignorance that abound in the field of education 
 And yes, I do believe it's a big scam.    The sad truth of being human is that everyone feels anger and stress and fear. It's part of life (though first-worlders may do better at avoiding it than some). If back pain were caused by stress,  or even just exacerbated by it, then people in refugee camps, soldiers, and people with serious illnesses like cancer would get it in higher proportion, right? But in all my reading, I've never heard that this is the case.   Doctors don't understand back pain, period. It used to be that they didn't understand stomach ulcers either and therefore also attributed them to stress. In this case also, quite a few patients felt better by adopting a less stressful life or eating bland food. Now we know that ulcers are caused by a bacteria and that this malady completely unaffected by food choice. Yet for years, doctors were convinced that their remedies were effective.  In my opinion, stress is a catch-all "cause" that is applied to many  misunderstood diseases (particularly those common in women, but that's another subject). We all know stress is unpleasant, but does it really cause sickness? Couldn't stress just be an easy answer to a tough question? In the 19th century, temperment was thought to cause TB. And in the 17th century, strange illnesses were attributed to witchcraft. The human mind has trouble saying: I don't know. Doctors have trouble saying: I don't know why you're in pain.  Furthermore, Dr. Sarno offers no justification for leaving his theories untested by scientific method. Even a small double-blind study would be illuminating. It doesn't even have to be double-blind--just a study of some kind would be nice. Someday someone will figure out how the back works, and then Dr. Sarno's going to look like a big dummy. Frankly, I hope I'm around to see that. 
 Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates "escapes" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender,  and would suggest that their women forgive them for it! Sure, forgive them....but expect them to grow up at some point! I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. If I catch you flirting with other women, and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them, then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book, I'll shove MISTER, (not Doctor)Gray's book where the sun don't shine. For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please google The Rebuttal From Uranus, they really capture the truth 
 Said's book has, sadly, been hugely influential on thousands of university students, their professors, and many living in the islamic world.  His book should not be read without concurrently reading Ibn Warraq's critique _Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism_.  Said lays the blame for nearly everything wrong in the islamic world  at the feet of the West, and thus helped entrench the culture of victimhood that feeds into suicide bombings and riots against political cartoons.  By authorin this book, Said confirmed his place in History as an irresponsible poseur in scholarly trappings 
 Dragonheart did not need a sequel. The story was told. It is over. The first movie peaked therfore, end of franchise. This has bad acting, terrible C.G.I., and stupid story. Stick with the first 
 I've been programming in Delphi for over 10 years, so I've got the basics pretty well nailed.  Plus there's not much here about what is unique about Linux / Kylix / CLX.  The Web section was particularly disappointing.  No depth.  Maybe a decent beginner's book 
 I found the humor to be somewhat arid.  I had trouble staying awake. Not recommended while driving 
 Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.  However, despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as "a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot." Which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the "lost city", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.  I suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year.   Of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of "She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism, anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark. 
 Warner Brothers have reissued The Searchers in 2004, the transfer being stated as 1:1.85 aspect ratio.  In this package they are disposing of their old 1997 copies - this has a double sided disc, with a cropped 4:3 version on one side, and, even worse, on the flip side a widescreen version where the vertical image has been significantly cropped (the tops of actors' heads are often lopped off, and the magnificent landscapes are similarly ridiculously framed - to see what you are missing, just flip over to the 4:3 version: the heads and mesas and buttes are seen in full, but of course the horizontal image is severely cropped) - the stated aspect ratio is 1.75:1.   * Similarly they reissued Stagecoach in 2004, but this is the 1997 version.  The Cowboys dates from 1998, and Rio Bravo's transfer is from 2001. * I purchased this set primarily for The Searchers and to now find such an inferior transfer is very frustrating.  I would suggest potential buyers take care with other Warner Bros. compilations as they too might be deceptive means of dispensing of obsolete DVD transfers. 
 Titled Greatest Hits 85-95 ? But their nothing from his 1985 CD "Everybody's Crazy".  Other than that you have all his AC songs that were chart toppers from 1988-1993.  
 Literary coincidences occur occasionally, and this year's coincidence is the appearance of two novels about Henry James, both written by authors hailing from countries east of the Atlantic. (The other novel is David Lodge's Author, Author; I'll review that book here soon.) It is as if James has been appropriated by Irish and British authors, having been largely ignored by those of his native America for so long. James, who became a British citizen at the end of his life, spent most of his productive years in England and continental Europe. It is no surprise that his fiction has a European flavor, nor is it any surprise that he is such a beacon for British and Irish writers.  The Master in question is old Henry himself, who, in the final period of his life, has received this nickname from critics in praise of the quality of his prose and plots (James was arguably the greatest American author of his period; I confess to being a James fan myself, and even have a print of his portrait, painted by John Singer Sargeant, on the wall next to my desk).   At this time, Henry attempted to break into the theater, with the belief that he would not only achieve recognition from the general public but also the fortune that accompanies such success. In the way writers want to sell scripts to Hollywood today, James wanted to sell his stories to the London theater. Alas, it was a failure; a resounding failure, one that shook James' resolve and faith in himself.   Tibn is clearly a Jamesophile, yet he portrays old Henry as a socially inept, somewhat confused old man, who is uncomfortable at dinners and balls, and who longs for his preferred solitude, which he eventually finds in the house he purchases in the small town of Rye. While some may claim that this is a valid portrayal of James, though exaggerated, Tibn neglects to provide the book with a plot, and instead merely relates a series of incidents and events in Henry's life. While Tibn's writing is agreeable-it is, naturally, somewhat Jamesian-his story has little interest. Seen as a series of vignettes, cobbled together with flashbacks to try and put some depth into the story, Tibn shows James far too incompletely to make a novel that works.   For Tibn seems obsessed with showing examples of James' alleged homosexuality, going as far as inventing an incident with Oliver Wendell Holmes, when the two of them shared a bed in their youth. Recent years have seen many "scholars" suggesting that James is homosexual, though the evidence is of the "they have weapons of mass destruction" type. In fact, after reading this book, with its unsuccessful denouement, one wonders if Tibn simply wanted to present this hypothesis in a fictional form, and filled in the rest so there would be something worth publishing.   Tibn does little more than fill in spaces around events described by Leon Edel in his monumental biography of Henry James. By fleshing out these events, Tibn does give more life to them than Edel does, but is it worth it? To me, having read Edel recently, and being familiar with James' work, the book seemed to drag on, as I hoped to find some sort of narrative thread in the work. But I was not fortunate; Tibn simply relates events, albeit occurring within a specific period, without doing more than adding dialog and inner impressions to the characters actions.   But this raises a deeper question about such a book. That a writer of Tibn's ilk could simply create a docu-drama of some events in a real person's life suggests that he is in a period of plotter's block. It is relatively simple to depend on reality, and add a few strokes of dialog, and while it is oft said that truth is stranger than fiction, in this case, the truth doesn't provide for an interesting read. James' life was certainly remarkable, yet decidedly uneventful. And Tibn's choice of telling a part of that story in this manner falls flat, in part because there is no real denouement.   Many reviewers seem to be fawning over this book, using such panegyrics as "the literary novel of the summer." But it seems that these critics are jaded, and willingly accept anything that has a "classical" background in order to escape the banality of much contemporary fiction. Henry James was an extraordinary writer, an exceptional man, in his own manner, and his life is quite a story, but he is poorly served by this "novel", which seems to be little more than an exercise in fictionalizing such a man's life. This book will certainly appeal to the boobs (as Mencken called them), who find it just the right thing to make them look smart, but readers looking for a good book would be better off picking up some of the Master's work and ignoring Tibn. 
 When I order this book, I thought I will get lots of ready-to-use "Goals" which I can esay to set my subordinate's Goals. But I am very disappoint. Lots of Goals listing in the books are actually the working items not goals. Like "Deposit completed backups...", "Schedule all planned shutdown...". Therefore this book help me to setup the work items of my subordinate not set the goals.  Sa 
 Man, what monastery did these guys crawl out of? We have optical and radio telescopes these days; why not look for example of your conjectures elsewhere in the solar system? The psalmist says, "The imbecile contemplates that there is no Elohim". And isn't that the point? In their zeal to undercut the most compelling scientific argument against evolution, we're now to believe that "Mother Nature" abhors a gradient. And, somehow we're to believe that the existence of life is just an efficient means of dissipating energy? C'mon guys! Is that the best you've got? I'm sure this argument appeals to true believers, but its presentation in "Into the Cool: Energy Flow, Thermodynamics, and Life" must make most objective scientists cringe. In fact, it will probably make them think about how life really did come about for the first time in their lives. In that sense, it's the only commendable aspect of your bound speculations. I'll be thinking about your latest contribution in support of the Darwinian religion the next time I pour cold cream in my hot coffee .... Hahaha 
 Like the other two people who already commented, my Blue Ridge 2" Baffle Box Feather Bed (Queen Size) looks good and is nicely priced (I purchased it as an Amazon 'Deal of the Day' item), but unless you enjoy feathers poking you all over, you should avoid this product at any cost. I have two sheets, one flannel, covering the product, and I am still being uncomfortably poked 
 This movie is an insult to merely bad comedies. Gee, another movie with a fast-talking, potty-mouthed, black guy (hello Eddie Murphy) who, because it's perfectly fine in ultra-lib, pc Hollyweird, calls Charlie Sheen (and everyone else who is not Black) a host of nasty, racially-oriented names. The movie is a mess. Let's see. The protagonist (Tucker) plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a cop-killer, is chased around  by cops and the bad guys. The McGuffin is a sack of diamonds. Sheen is supposed to be a co-star, but like most of his other movies, he sleepwalks through it. Clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for Tucker. The sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along. First "screenwriter":" Hey Bob, what will we have Tucker do next? Hey I know, let's have a car chase and have him call some people some names" Second "screenwriter" "Hey, great idea Fred, I sure don't have any ideas".  Apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a rip-off of Murphy the Trickster flicks. Basically the plot is Tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name. If that's your idea of humor, I pity you.  
 In her section about Lakewood, the author tries to create a connection between Lakewood, the spur posse, and the military-industrial complex that does not exist.  She regards Lakewood as a breeder town, built to supply human labor for the aerospace industry.  Here are the facts:  1.  Lakewood was created in 1948 by real estate investors to provide housing for returning WW2 veterans.  2.  The LB Naval Shipyard, Douglas Aircraft, Lockheed, Northrop, and North American Aviation were all in operation long before Lakewood was built.  3.  The spur posse was given way too much publicity by the tabloid TV vultures to a National audience.  I emphasize the word National.  The market for those kind of unhealty tv shows goes beyond southern Calif.  Lakewood home values are very good, and the neighborhood infrasturcture is a lot more organized than most southern Calif housing projects built in the same era.  If she wants to bash a southern Calif. neighborhood, Long Beach would be an easier target.  There, you have many nice one-home lots that were destroyed by investors who built 8-unit apartments on a one-home lot.  Anyone who has not actually lived in Lakewood might believe her essay...but it is not reality.  In the end, she thinks So. Calif is headed over the cliff.  I would say the idyllic "Calif. Golden Fantasy" is no more...but whatever changes that occur here will have to be dealt with in a positive manner, instead of just being given an obituary 
 This book really is badly edited. There are entire pages that lack punctuation. It's difficult enough to master torts without struggling through the basic grammar. The book also is very case heavy and explanation light. Those reading it had better hope for an excellent torts prof 
 Hey, BRRRRRUUUUUCCCE!  What's the deal? Just about every major Top 40 artist has had their catalogs sonically updated EXCEPT YOURS.  Why can we buy the "Tracks" editions, and get glorious HDCD-encoded sound, but "Town" sounds like it's coming out an AM radio?  OK, you did your best, but Dubya's back in the White House for the next four years, and Kerry's home in his underwear watching the Weather Channel. You should have plenty of time on your hands now... GET BUSY!  Let's see some remastering! 
 As a mother staying home more than working outside the home right now, I really wanted to like and feel affirmed by this book. However, since my oldest was born 14 years ago I have worked full time, not at all, and everything in between. The author states very early in the book that one of the first editors she sent the manuscript to rejected it and suggested that she not be quite as polarizing as she was right off the bat, and that she tone down the "staying home is definitely best - childcare is sub-par" message. Because of her non-negotiable position, I basically found myself mentally arguing with her throughout the whole book.   I guess if a woman is just having her first baby and is able to stay at home right from the start, this might be a good book to read. However, if one has already done some work outside the home, and has ever had a child in childcare, she should expect to be offended and annoyed.  
 I am embarrased to say it, but I've read this book at least 10 times.  The nightmare began some 8 years ago when at the urging of a "friend" I entered rehab for what would become the first of many such "treatments". The indoctrination process began immediately. "The first 163 pages will save your ..." was just one of the things I was told by some washed up alcoholic who once resorted to drinking Sterno while living homeless in some ravine.  It never stopped. Go to enough AA meetings and you'll hear the same things over and over and over...you get the idea. How quickly we (newcomers) were brainwashed. For me there was always an uneasy feeling. It was creepy to hear those who were only days out of rehab sound off parroting the same sentiments and cliches of their sponsors. An ominous warning I should have paid attention to.   Years later I realize that I was one of the unfortunate souls that was swept away into a religious cult with the help of counselors, social workers, 12 steppers and even doctors. I became sicker, despondent and my drinking and using worsened.  My sanity was replaced with the belief that I was powerless and my only hope was within "the Program". There's a good reason they call it your "Program". I became a 12 step automaton immersing myself deeper into the religiousity of AA with each successive relapse. I did it all. A meeting every day, working the steps, attending step studies, service work, conventions, retreats...you name it-I did it. I surrendered common sense and reason and followed the direction of 12 step fruitcakes. If you are newly sober and looking for help look elsewhere. This book is a waste of time and may even be hazardous to your health. If it's a support group you think you need go to a Life Ring meeting or better yet stay home and read Rational Recovery or one of Ellis' books. Do not go to  12 step meetings. I haven't been to an AA meeting in close to 2 years and I am finally sober and happy. Go figure. Stay away from 12 steppers. It took me years to come to this realization and that is this - Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are more concerned with AA than they are with helping people stay sober. Just take a look at the numbers. The vast majority of recovered addicts/alcoholics recover without 12 step involvement. AA and its evil spawn NA have hurt more people than they have helped. 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 Evolution is supported by mountains and mountains of documented, irrefutable evidence from educated, professional, intelligent people who have simply followed the course of where their research took them.  It's no longer about one guy who wrote one book in the mid-1800's.  Not any more.  Inform yourselves, people.  I challenge anyone reading this to actually investigate how much supporting research there is out there for evolution in science, in astronomy, biology geology and physics.  It's overwhelming.  Check out some web sites from some universities and research institutes to get an idea of how research is being done on evolution all over the world.  Do you think they're all in a conspiracy, and that they're just making it all up 
 Essentially a picture book w/ limited text. Printing and design are dated and of average quality at best. A few great pics but lots of filler.  Some day they will come out with a book that does justice to this fantastic sport... 
     What can you say about a book that introdouces three characters in one chapter? Or has a character thats entire vocabulary seems to consist of "Hotcha, Gotcha" and says that nearly 10 times a chapter. I would honestly not care if all the people upped and died. This book has no surprises but one, a "plot twist" that was obvious 6 chapters away. Did I mention I hate the annoying, underdeveloped, characters. Oh yes. I usually like Bruce Coville, but with this book, he has bought himself to a level of unreadability that is only outclassed by the sequel 
 This work was well-drawn, as is all of Bechdel's work.  It was also incredibly boring, kind of aimless, self-absorbed catharsis.  I also thought we'd get to know more about her father's life, thoughts, feelings...along with hers.  I love her other stuff, but this rambling tome just wasn't for me 
 Although the video was easy to follow, there was no variation between the segments.  The 10 minute segments were basically the same. I was looking for a quick video that I can do in the morning but it seemed that I spent most of the time warming up and stretching and then continuing with the same moves.  If you are at all experienced and are looking for a quick targeted workout this is not the video for you 
 I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.   Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books. 
 it is juust a copy of the frist book. if you read the frist the world is flat, then don't waste your time. jo 
 This book seemed a little to "fly by night" when reading it.  When I took a class with Charna Halpern she couldn't stop quoting it.  It made me sick.  It seems that Truth in Comedy preps you to join her cult of young actors that think they will be discovered at her ImprovOlympic, which seems to actually be losing money by the year.  How can one make brave moves in improv if they're constantly talked down to, in print and in person 
 This book is a self-indulgent wallow in the mire of despair.  Wolfe starts with the supposition that "our earliest ancestors. . . crawled out of the primeval slime," that God is "an unwitting spirit" in "remote eternity," and consequently that prayer is useless and the earth is forgotten, and then whines when he is left with the natural conclusions of a godless world view: that life is accidental, without meaning and without hope.  The characters fumble around, looking for salvation in "a stone, a leaf, an unfound door," (tragically rejecting the Way, the Truth, and the Life) only to find at last that there is no point in looking for salvation at all, since "There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger," "YOU are your world."  This book is unorthodox, unwholesome, and unhealthy.  Avoid it for your own good 
 This book has quite a bit of information for those wanting to show their Berner.  I am not interested in showing and was quite disappointed.  It does not talk a lot about simple pet training or other issues and has only black & white picture.  I find the book quite boring and not too practical 
 For the last 2 years I have listened to about 1 audio book per week and this takes first place as the worst of the lot. The exercises in this audio book are trivial and insulting. Save your money 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 I started adding files to this card to use in my phone, but it has never shown more than 1 gb capacity even though it is printed 2.0 gb on the face. I have contacted Sandisk just earlier tonight to find out what is up with this card. So far I am more confused than pleased 
 anybody who is a true 2pac fan will understand that this album would leave 2pac rolling around in his grave. 2pac would never have worked with artists like eminem or elton john and what is even more sickening is the clear distortion of his voice to fit in with eminems beats. These are not songs that 2pac would have ever produced himself, does not even have a familiar 2pac feel or vibe. Anyone purchasing this album is only making eminem richer and defaming 2pac's legacy as far as I am concerned. People who disagree should listen to 2pac's original albums and then understand what i am talking about. This album is an embarassment to somebody as great as 2pac 
 With so much talent on show here you would expect a lot better movie, but this is another case of the scriptwriters letting the movie down. Matthew McConaughey delivers another good performance, yet doesn't stray too far from what he knows best. There is Bradley Cooper as his best friend who you will remember as Rachel McAdams fiance in wedding crashers. Patton Oswalt appears in a blink and you'll miss him scene, but the heros of the day are Kathy Bates and Zooey Deschanel who's roles are a lot more important than the characters they play. Bates is great as McConaughey's mother while Zooey is at her sarcastic best as Parker's flatmate. Parker should stick to television, she is dreadful and totally unconvincing in her role, maybe if they had cast someone else in her place there may have been a chance for this movie. A good date movie flick, the story is predictable but I would have been willing to look past that had I been entertained. Special features are nothing too special. A trailer and a few dodgy featurette's. A rainy night rental movie 
 Only Worth the second stop-motion sequence, when Flesh fights a robot twig. That scene is almost flawless and as good as any Harryhausen animation. The one love scene with Flesh and the hot curvy brunette is also nice. The film is worth a rent if your curious but it's really just a lame and unfunny movie. If your open to seeing a trashy sci-fi satire of Flash Gordon with some interesting special effects give it a look. Especially fans of stop-motion animation in which the film features 3 creature sequences 
 If you have NEVER flipped a house, this would be or you. They deal with a lot of surface material. They give you options on the different ways of accomplishing a task, but anyone with half a brain could figure it ou. I would recommend this book to someone "thinking" about flipping, but not anyone who has done it. The book lacks in REAL content. It's too easy of a read, nothing complicated, nothing new, all just common sense 
 I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished.  It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.  Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading 
 Flynn is half-crazy and I can't for the life of me understand how he was able to type with his arms in a strait-jacket. With a book this awful to his credit, he'd make a great White House reporter 
 I was very disapointed in the book.Basicly the writer took bits and pieces from books written by others,twisted their words and put his own spin on it.It repeats itself over and over being so repetative I had to put it down.There are good books out there written by people who were there.I suggest you take a look at those.I read many good one's but this book wasnt in that catagory 
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 The only thing that kept this from being ABSOLUTELY predictable was that a dead bad guy did NOT spring back to life.  I found myself saying "Oh come on" to one plot point after another (previous reviewers have covered these absurdities).  The underlying scenario was unconvincing and un-involving (previous reviews in this thread provide details) 
 I agree with the problems related to all the technical issues cited by other reviewers, but found the movie problematic at its core. First, military personnel are not EVER in the chain of diplomatic authority in a United States Embassy. So the entire premise of this movie is an impossibility because the character JCVD portrays would never be "Second in Command." Sure, there is a willing suspension of disbelief when watching a movie, but there is just SO MUCH WRONG in this movie, that verisimilitude is impossible. A Navy Commander (O-5) outranks a Marine captain (O-3) and would ALWAYS have command precedent in a military situation, whether a message was sent to higher authority or not. Marines simply do not dress nor act like those depicted in this film. The uniforms were wrong. The "Gunny" had a soul patch and chin whiskers! NEVER! And the Marine captain tells a Marine to "seal this room, soldier." ARRGGGH! No Marine, under any circumstances, would refer to another as a "soldier." How about the Marine Expeditionary Unit helicopters, hovering over the Embassy, announcing, "This is the U. S. Army..."? Oh, and what Marine Embassy Security Unit, defending their post from attack during the hours of darkness, would have the building bathed in light 
 I saw this book in a book store and refused to pay retail for a bunch of hogwash.Man didnot write the bible. Man was simply a secretary guide by the Holy Spirit of God. When all  scholars of the day said that the world was flat.God in his bible said it was a sphere.When man said the earth rested on the shoulders of atlas or some great turtle God's word said it was  suspended in space.The same Spirit that  moved men to write  the words of God is the same Spirit you need to understand it and take it by faith. Dr. Darkwah doesnot have that Spirit 
 As Jacques Derrida becomes more discredited every day, (French intellectuals are rushing to distance themselves from his now seen-to-be-absurd positions) you have to wonder can Eisenman's inevitable fall from the pedestal of fad popularity be far behind.  This impossibly arrogant book has all of it's pages punctured by small holes that make a reading impossible.  For Eisenman, this childish gimmick, must seem amusing, albeit in a trite, predictable sort of way. But that sort of pride comes with a price.  But even Derrida, low as his standards were soon found to be, discontinued further exchanges with Eisenman.  As the architectural community likewise finds Eisenman to be the embarrassing soul he always was, you don't want to be one of the few left with this ridiculous volume on your shelf 
 No where on the amazon page did it mention that this book is mini-sized.  It is about 2" by 3" and as a result the quality is compromised.  
 Good Lord, people must be busier than I thought. If you haven't been allowed to even think about your future after retirement, then maybe you will get something out of this book.  For the rest of us, this is drivel 
 Buried in various places in this 287 page book are few intellectual gems which strikes a chord with reality. Otherwise, the authors of this book never seemed to have touched a server nor managed an IT department.  The book deals with 10 topics:  1)Lead, don't manage. (This part was very weak) 2)Understand the fundamentals of your environment (The CIOs have to understand the fundamentals too??) 3)Create a vision for how IT will build your organization's success. (You mean CIOs should have a goal??)  4)Shape and inform expectations for an IT enabled enterprise (You mean computers can't do everything??) 5)Create clear and appropriate IT governance. (The authors claim that IT governance is secret to IT success...and I was dumb enough to believe having talented personnel is secret to IT success). 6)Weave business and IT strategy together. (As if business and IT are not weaved together in the first place. Yeah, all those million dollars worth of servers are secretly being used to play video games and do nothing for the business at all) 7)Build a new IS organization--one that is leaner and more focused than its more traditional predecessor. (Do more with less...what else is new??) 8)Develop and nurture a high performance team in your IS organization. (I think this one has been written only a million times in other books). 9)Manage the new enterprise and IT Risks (Strictly fillers) 10)Communicate IS performance in business relavant language. (This chapter was nice...essentially, you should market the importance of IT as much as possible) 
 maybe because I didn't like Porco. Everything was sub-par for me. Animation is definitely not as good as his later movies. Not enough weirdness, tried too much for the plot. Everything was just too ho-hum. As if he tried to carry the whole movie on Porco's shoulders. But once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and Porco was a pig there wasn't anything else there. 
 I bought this lipgloss at my local Sephora store. First of all..DO NOT EXPECT TO SEE ANY PLUMPING WHAT SO EVER. It makes No difference in how your lips look. Secondly, it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball. The ONLY reason this gloss is $18 is because of the Too Faced name brand. DONT waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good/better for a few bucks at the drugstor 
 This book is fine for teaching patterns, it's main intent.  I have a problem with the behavior of the kids however.  First, the older brother doesn't share and his parents have no problem with this.  Secondly, the younger child sneaks around misbehaving and ignoring both of her parents and her brother yet she's rewarded with a gift.  We won't be reading this one again 
 This is the best coffee I've ever had.  Very smooth with rich flavor 
 This book was so hard to follow I sent it back, and I have read and enjoyed a lot of books that are technical in nature or historical in nature.  As I tried to go through this book I was bogged down at once in jargon fit for AD 1600.  Not the kind of thing I want to wade through for reference material or anything else.  There are a lot of other books out there which cover this material and are a lot easier to read 
 The opening track is an awesome collaboration with Sting.  I thought that if the rest of the CD was that good, I'd love it. It isn't, and I don't.  In fact, there are only two tracks on this disk I really like.  The only other song I liked on it was the very funny Changing Your Demeanor (who knew Derek Bell could honky-tonk like that?!).  The rest of it just doesn't work.  Tom Jones does such a hammy job of Tennessee Waltz, he ruins one of my all-time favorite songs.  And I'm sorry, but Mick Jagger singing The Rocky Road to Dublin is just wrong.  A rare misfire from a usually rock-reliable group of musicians 
 I tried to look at this book with an open mind, but that was impossible.  If you want to convince someone to believe something, you need better people to quote than notorious liars; michael moore and al franken.  This book spews nothing but hated filled vomit and I don't reccomend it for anyone.  If you accept everything the Looney Left tells you without questioning anything, then by all means waste your money.  If you have a brain and think for yourself and don't buy into all the crap from these incredibly radical communists, keep your money and stay far away from this book.  People should have to do with their time than to just make money off hatred. Lesli 
 This is a text that, taken at face value, can destroy the understanding of the period it sets out to explore.  A caution is not enough for this book.  Its immense learning on a small range of things - useful enough for the specialist - goes with the most spectacular ignorance of the wider area, so that Gnosticism can be taken to embrace both Plotinus and Hermes Trismegistus, in fact anything that is not properly Catholic. Hans Jonas' problem is not specialization; specialization is only his excuse for what is an unconscious but almost deliberate refusal to learn certain categories, a refusal to challenge his own inadequate views on some matters, his unthinkng adhesion to a way of thinking he learned early - or rather, never learned at all, but absorbed as attitudes from the surrounding environment - and never challenged.  In particular, he assumes as obvious that heresy is inherently creative and orthodoxy inherently destructive (rather than the reverse), so that all the positive advances in religious history, from mysticism to monasticism, are to be ascribed not to the Christian Church but to his beloved Gnostic rebels.  I would guess that it is from this presumption, a fundamental and basic superstition that dominates his entire outlook, that he set out to study the ultimate in heresy, Gnosticism, in the first place.  He expected to find spiritual creativity and progress there, and he found - or rather, "found" - what he wanted.  It is not that specialization ruined him, but that the already accomplished ruin of his mind governed his choice of specialization.  That this sort of presumption in favour of heresy should go with a Bultmannite background - which logically should have no particular reason to go hunting in this particular preserve - only goes to show that sooner or later all heresies meet; if not on logically defensible grounds, at least on the common ground of the common hatred of orthodoxy.  And yet there is one last doom to which this sort of person is inevitably put: just as they think that they have taken the struggle against orthodoxy to its climax, they suddenly find themselves outdated and almost reactionary - in this case, by the rise of a new school of anti-orthodoxy associated with the name of Karen L. King, who, far from proclaiming the high merits and unique historical position of Gnosticism, proclaim that no such thing as Gnosticism ever existed - it was all a wicked intellectual construction put on their enemies by the nasty, colonialistic, male-imperialistic Catholics, which, after two millennia of obscurity, has finally been revealed by the lights of feminist, deconstructionist, non-judgemental theory!  Ain't life grand 
 I have yet to actually watch more than the first 10 mins. The quality is so bad I refused to go any further. For the life of me I can see how any Studio worth its salt could release anything so poor; where has "Pride In Your Work" gone. I could hardly make out the actors in this movie. I skipped forward by chapters just to see if some change had taken place, but to my dismay there was none. I am not one of those critics always writing bad reviews, in fact this is probably my second ever. I just had to warn other buyers so they don't get shafted like I did. In all fairness the movie itself may actually be great but for me what is the use if its un-watchable. Its almost like a bad bootleg movie (I refuse to watch those too). I am sure they could have spent some more time and money to remaster it and get all the graininess out and bring clarity to this film. All in all this is just my opinion and I hope it helps someone save their money, however if you don't mind the picture quality get it because I love the Trinity Saga 
 If you have read (and enjoyed) any of the X-men, save your $, buy the graphic novel of the original dark Phoenix saga, and pretend this movie wasn't made.  If you want to see some special effects & aren't that hung up on character development, I'd still just rent it 
 This book was required reading my first year in college. It eneded up consuming the entire year in a depessing and dire atmosphere. Every class we talked about the book, it's themes, it's techniques.  Never once did anyone dare to say they disliked the story. How could you say you disliked a personal story about the Holocaust and the ending in which she relays to the entire world that she is homosexual. You couldn't voice an oppinion against this at the risk of being "A Nazi" or a "Homophobe".  I'm risking that to tell every person here that this story was terrible. It was about the author harassing her Holocaust surviving parents over and over again about their terrible ordeal. They wanted to have it in the past, over with, gone, and forgotten. The memories were too hard to dredge up and frankly they were none of their daughter's business. BUT the author Sherlock's the information and writes this book. She then said in the end that she was homosexual when this information had nothing to do with the story. The entire book was a way to "come out" with all the stress on her parents and none on herself.  This indeed was a sad story, but because of the desparate and self centered needs of the author. It's easy to have a best seller when you make your subject matter a taboo subject to disagree with.   Read it if you want and form your own opinions. This is just mine. 
 The first book I bought was the paperback edition - the print was too small for me to read.  I then purchased the hardback edition - the print was fine on this one.  The overall material is good for a reference since this book is referred to often in the field of evolution.  However, Darwinism is just a theory with no credibility, in light of recent findings in astrophysics and microbiology.  As Darwin says in his own book - if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.  The Big Bang in cosmology, irreducible complexity and DNA information coding in microbiology make Darwin's theroy break down.  I recommend the DVDs Unlocking the Mystery of Life and Journey toward Creation as supplemental material.  Also the book by Michael Denton - Evolution: a Theory in Crisis 
 This book has about 200 pages of information. At best, I would call it an OVERVIEW, but by no means complete. I was really disapointed by the lack on information regarding Pagan ties to magic. The total number of pages relating to that topic is 7. 7!!! Thats pathetic! Divination is barely touched on... this is just an extremely breif book. I honestly wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they wanted a concise text about Magic in Literature of the Middle Ages. That is honesly the only topic explained enough 
 First of all, let me say that I'm a staunch Libertarian.  I agree with all of Mr. Richman's ideas, I think American education is in drastic need of reform, and I do not believe in government schooling at all.  Having said that, this is a horrible book.  Most of it has nothing to do with education per se, but is rather a rehash of all of the classic, broad Libertarian arguments.  He talks at great length about how privatizing education will give parents greater choice and control over their children's education, the superiority of the market over government control, yada yada.  Yes, these arguments apply to education, but they are not specifically about education.  Neither is this interesting writing.  Anybody familiar with very basic Libertarian ideas will be bored to tears by this book.  Furthermore, Richman's main sources are "Education: Free and Compulsory," by Rothbard, and various works by Gatto.  Half of the book is comprised of quotes from these and a few other sources.  The other half is Richman's rephrasing of these quotes.  I cannot emphasize enough how little Richman adds to the ideas he presents.  The reviews below discuss how Richman talks about the history of education, the comparison of church and school, etc.  If these reviewers had read "Free and Compulsory," they would have gotten the same discussion at a much deeper level from a much better author.  One reviewer mentioned how the format of school, with children in desks being lectured, is a problem.  If they'd read "Dumbing us Down," they'd have gotten a better discussion of that from someone with experience.  Now, the two aforementioned books are certainly good works, and if you're interested in education, I'd recommend reading them, but you don't need to read Richman's glorified synopsis.    Finally, it's not surprising that Richman doesn't have any original thoughts on education.  He's not an educator, he's a writer for a Libertarian think-tank.  As such, I should not find it surprising that this book is a rehashing of familiar Libertarian ideas.  If you're really interested in the problems of this country's education system, read Gatto, he was a public school teacher for thirty years, and he has very good, credible insights.    PS.  The only reason I'm giving this book a second star is for its 20 page appendix that discusses some studies on standardized testing and the relationship between school performance and work performance.  It's a good discussion.  If the whole book were like it, I might not be so mad I spent fifteen dollars.  As it is though, I must recommend emphatically, DON'T BUY THIS 
 Very little offered in this book about what to do for the ravages of Menopause, except "take more time and use lots of LUBE". Once the hormones are gone, so's any motivation your partner might have had to get things back on track. Barry keeps telling us that WE are responsible for our OWN sexuality, and that you have a RIGHT to be sexual, but when your partner's more motivated over the cat hucking up a hairball instead salvaging your relationship, Oh, Well. Perhaps in a future edition the McCarthys should add an additional catagory to marriages that should get a "mercy killing": the "I'm done with that foolishness, and you should be, too" marriage 
 I don't like BlueProton because they sent me a defective item and I have to pay the return shipping fee. I like Amazon because they refund me whole the payment, otherwise BlueProton would not refund me the shipping fee which is more expensive than the price of item 
 Didn't like the recipes in this one--just not our taste.    
 I've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe. However, in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday (blue with red and silver) is synthetic.  Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price, you receive a leather shoe! You are not "saving $50" if it's synthetic 
 Why this woman starts yoga sitting on her legs is beyond me. I did Yoga in my younger years and did it at the Integral Yoga Institute and went away from the practice for 20 years. If this woman's DVD is the new market of Yoga, it is a shame. This is her version, it stinks and is almost impossible fora 50 year old out of shape body to do, much less lose weight by. Especially by starting sitting on your legs. How absurd, what a waste of money 
 I have been doing a lot of research into the Da Vinci Code, so I though I would pick up a copy of Templar Revelation, since that was one of Dan Brown's main sources. Little did I know that I had stumbled upon one of the worst books I will probably ever read in my entire life. I'm not even sure where to begin describing how frustrating it was to read this book. This is the most biased book that I can ever remember reading. No matter what the data is, the authors make it fit their theory.  Towards the beginning I came across a paragraph that sets the tone for the whole book: "So, to begin our story proper we have to return to Leonardo's Last Supper and look at it with new eyes. This is not the time to view it in the context of familiar art-historical assumptions. This is the moment when it is appropriate to see it as a complete new comer" (p. 19-20). And yes, the authors stick with this theme through the whole book: ignore hisorical research and look at everything out of context. You can see how much they like historical research by examining their bibliography. It contains almost no actual historical documents (other than the Bible and the Gnostic Gospels, which are both always cited out of context to distort the meaning), nor does it contain any research volumes done by professional historians. Almost EVERY citation in the book is from other conspiracy theorists, and most of these citations are straight from Holy Blood and Holy Grail, which is not exactly known for being a very accurate historical book (I do not know of one single historian who would even dream of citing it as an authority on a subject). They simply cites other conspiracy theorists who can hardly be treated as authorities in historical reasearch. They also like to cite their previous book, which is hardly convincing if they have no source to cite for supossed historical events other than their own previous book which says it happened.  On the topic of citations, I find it very telling that the authors make all kinds of historical claims without citing a source. They will say something like "historians agree that..." and then not cite anything, and most of the time when they do this I cannot immagine that any real historians would actually agree with whatever was just said. Further, for a good number of their claims they simply cite private conversations with people, which of course no one can verify. Many of their major theories come from a man whom they do not even know who met them one day on the street and claimed to be a member of the Priory of Sion and filled them in on all of the secrets of the Priory. It's too bad this guy never talked to anyone else and no one has any way of verifying that he even exists.  Also, the authors BLATANTLY skim over problems with their theory and continue in spite of something being proven wrong. The authors ACKNOWLEDGE that the Dassiers Secrets papers (the ones with the list of the Masters of the Priory of Sion as well as a lot of other information about them, including their links to the Meringovian French line of Kings) were a HOAX. The current Master of the Priory (as listed in the papers) admitted to planting the papers to be discovered and admitted that he was on LSD when he wrote them. A search was done on his home and forged papers were found declaring him to be the King of France. So, the authors of this book admit that those papers were a hoax, yet the continue to use them as a main source for their theories througout the rest of the book!!! They use them as evidence about the Priory of Sion, and BASE their conspiracies on them, despite admitting that they are fraudulant! Their blatant use of admittedly faked papers as a major source of their ideas is beyond rediculous. Don't worry though, the authors have the problem solved: if we think about it differently the problem goes away! "One dubious connection or apparent contradiction concerning the Priory's activities invariable leads skeptics to denounce the entire theory as errant nonsense from beginning to end. But it must be remembered that we are dealing with Myth Makers, who are often more concerned with conveying powerful and even shocking ideas through the use of archetypal images than with communicating the literal truth." (p. 41). Well, that certanly solves the problem doesn't it?  Another example: the authors note a mysterious connection between the number of Mary Magdalene sites and the number of John the Baptist churches in southern France. They the note that, "of course the prevelance of building dedicated to John may easily be explained by the fact that the Knights Hospitaler... have always particularly venerated him and they have a strong presence in the area." The authors then proceed to make up theories about it ANYWAY, even though they just explained the reason for it. They spend the rest of the chapter (a good number of pages) trying to figure out just why it is that this connection is there. Rediculous.  Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the whole book, however, are the GIANT leaps in logic found all throughout the book. For example  - The authors note that some of the Cathars were protected by the Knights Templar (she fails to mention that that was because they were the Templar's customers), so the logical conclusion drawn from this is... the Templars were obviosuly Magdalene worshiping heretics!  -"Chartes Cathedral... contains a stone carving of what appears to be the Virgin Mary, with the carved 'label': arcis foederis - Ark of the Covenant.  In itself this is not very significant, for it was a standard Christian symbol in medieval times.  But as Chartes was a centre of the Black Madonna cult [note that the authors give no referrence for this claim], is the Ark being equated with that other Mary, the Magdalen, or even with a much older, pagan goddess?  Perhaps it is the Feminie principle itself that is being evoked, using the 'cover' of the Marian symbol." (p. 113).  Impressive stuff, huh?  Then there's the amazing places where the authors contradict themelves, like when the authors explain that Jesus did not really die and that someone dies in his place. A few pages later, they start explaining that Mary Magdalene was the first to see the post-crucified Jesus and they discuss the significance of that.  As you can see, these authors have already decided that the conspiracy exists, then they try to make all of the facts fit their theory.  It results in many, many logical leaps and contradictions.  The authors literally see Magdalene behind every reference to or image of the Virgin Mary if it is made by a person they have decided must be in on the "Magdalene Secret."  They find hidden meanings in things which were not meant to have hidden meanings.  They could literally look at a pattern on a carpet and somehow find that the Priory of Sion was trying to communicate a deep truth to them through the carpet's design.  And then they would cite themselves as a source to back their interpretation up.  In conclusion, I do not recommend this book at all, unless you enjoy reading illogical conspiracy theories, because that is all that this book contains.  Take a look at the authors' other books and you'll see that they are simply people willing to buy into conspiracy theories.  The book that they wrote together after this one was entitled "The Stargate Conspiracy: The Truth about Extraterrestrial life and the Mysteries of Ancient Egypt."  It described how the Egyptian pyramids were built by space aliens.  Their claim at the end of this book:  John the Baptist was the real Messiah.  Do yourself a favor and read a book more worth your time, because this one doesn't deserve any of it.  Overall grade:   
 I read this book with an open mind.  I am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status.  In a few cases, I think this criticism may be legitimate; in other cases, not.  So I was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the Holocaust or their advocates in the Jewish community.    (Note:  I am not equating child abuse and the Holocaust.  I am saying that when people speak up about terrible things, there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities.  All things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction.)  I didn't find anything in this book to convince me of that.  What I found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the Jewish reaction to the Holocaust, in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over, and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons, but this discussion is so subjective and brief that I was not persuaded to adopt his point of view.    The bulk of the book consists of complaints that Jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as Switzerland.  The argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because I have never read the reports ("audits," etc.) to which the author refers.  But I think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point.  I expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the Holocaust caused some Jews to "play the victim card," and what I got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which I have no way of determining the truth of the author's allegations.  To me it seems obvious that the Holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the Jews, and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result.  It seems reasonable to me that the Jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage, and to the extent that this book detracts from this, I think it is unfortunate 
 I was born and raised in India on the wrong side of the caste system. I worked hard to become educated and to come to America. Perhaps in the 1960s, America was not as fair as it is now, but it was still better than anywhere else. I find books like this, where people whine about the amount of melanin in their skin, offensive. Angelou comments often about how much she hates white people. This is stupid and it shows how uneducated she still is.   If she had written this in the 1960s, in the throes of it, it might be interesting as a historical piece, but now it just shows how racist she it. I'll bet she hates Asians, too. Even when she was abandoned in Egypt by a man she wrongly called her "husband," (even though they weren't married,) she wouldn't go to the American embassy for help because white people worked there. Every slight in her life, she attributes to white people being racist because she is black.   This book is filled with name-dropping and smug anger.   Minn 
 This books contains just about everything you will need to FULLY understand the implentation of tcp/ip on a unix based computer.  But if you are like the 95% of people in the computer world, you are running windows, and this book contains nothing regarding its implementation on a windows system 
 As other have stated, the performance is excellent.  My wife and I watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show.  With that said, my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did. They used some kind of filter on many of the shots.  They change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch.  You do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it.  Additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music.  I have to sell my copy because I get nauseas watching it.  I hope they re-make this DVD.  I think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing...and we could use the additional revenue stream... 
 My son received a Bumbo seat for Christmas.  At five months of age, he rolled out of it and was laying on top of the seat.  At six months of age, he turned in the seat and fell on to his HEAD on two different occassions.  The seat was on a flat surface.  He did this and I was standing or sitting right next to him. I loved this seat when he first got it.  I told everyone I knew about it. He has two older siblings and he  loved to be able to watch them play.  His siblings loved him sitting in the seat because he was at their level.    Now, I have absolutely NO confidence in the safety of this seat.  It is completely useless as his "own body weight" DOES NOT "keep baby in place" as advertised.  The seat has been rendered useless in my home because it is NOT safe and it is safer to put him in a traditional bouncy seat or on the floor. 
 After quickly exhausting the cultural significance of Jello-O boxes in her previous book, SYMPTOMS OF CULTURE, Marjorie Garber has now produced little  more than a book for realtors.  The result is banal and rather  stupid--anything but revelatory.  But perhaps the reader below doesn't take  the criticism far enough: this book has really nothing to say about the  scandalous cost of real estate in most major U.S. cities, the large number  of people who are homeless, and the millions of folks who are gouged every  month by unscrupulous landlords (how sexual is that, Professor Garber?).   Until recently, cultural critics expressed nominal interest in improving  our society.  Nowadays, concerned only about their fat publishing advances,  all they seem able to do is exhibit nauseating complicity with society's  ugliest elements 
 This books tells the amazing story of the notorious House Unamerican Activities Committee, 1938 to l968, and tells it in a highly dramatic way -- presenting the reader with the actual dialogues that took place in the committee room. It is a tale of folks you have heard of, but never seen in this light before -- among the names are Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Gary Cooper, Paul Robeson, Jerome Robbins, Zero Mostel, Elia Kazan...,and on and on. A rogues' gallery? Well,judge for yourself which guys are the rogues and which the heroes (if any)...In any event, the book is a terrific read 
 Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences.  Characters, like Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the "real world" works.  Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  While there are grains of truth in his characters, Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  I was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  I'm still looking. 
 These days, young (and not-so-young) children are subjected to such books with the intention of 'expanding their historical understanding, giving them a politically sensitive persepctive, and allowing for an introduction to what they cannot yet handle--real literature'. I have read this book; many teachers have their students read this book; it is a shame.  If your idea of good children's literature is this, then you'll probably enjoy such fine works as 'What Jamie Saw' and 'Gentlehands', the latter of which is a modern defense of a monsterous SS officer. And, also, if you enjoy this sort of work, do the world a favor and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home, preferably hidden in the closet, never to return to the real world again. So, if you're a teacher reading this review, don't force your students to read this and other drivel. Try Huck Finn... I'm fairly confident that most of you have heard of Mark Twain. Or, better yet, 'The Loved One' by Evelyn Waugh. Remember, it's never too late to teach your kids that subjects such as death and perversion can be--and are-- hillarious.  If you're a kid reading this, wondering if it's a good novel (I'm using the word novel loosely here), it isn't. This is the story of a little factory girl who pouts a lot about her existence but "keeps on truckin'" as they say, and in the end is about as enjoyable and empowering as, say, a dishwasher commercial. Read above for good books to read... they've got swear words and dirty humor, and are much more entertaining and informative than this trash. No, go pick up 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Your parents'll love that one. If you're an adult wondering if you should read this, I have nothing to say to you. You are beyond all hope and redemption 
 This book is in three parts.  In the first part tells we meet Miyax on the Arctic tundra after running away from her marriage.  We find that she is only thirteen years old, and is going to meet a friend in San Francisco.  Miyax has run out of provisions for her trip, and realizes that she is lost.  She decides to join a wolf pack to survive, so she studies their behavior and imitates it.  She is accepted, and is able to care for herself.  She also recognizes birds and, knowing their migration habits, is able to discern her location and direction.    The second part tells Miyax's life before part one.  It tells of her father, Kapugen, and how he sent her to live with his aunt Martha and go to school, where she is called Julie.  One day Aunt Martha told Miyax that her father had never returned from a hunting trip, and pieces of his kayak were found on the shore.  Kapugen had arranged a marriage between Miyax and the son of one of his old friends.  When she met Daniel, she was disappointed to realize that he was mentally slow.  After she was married, she basically became a helper to Daniel's mother in her business of making parkas to sell to tourists.  One day Daniel came home angry because others were taunting him with "having a wife and not knowing how to mate her."  Miyax ran away in fear that night.    Part three goes back to being lost on the tundra.  Miyax grows to love her wolf pack, and looks to the leader as her father.  When she sees him killed for sport, she decides not to head to San Francisco where people do not recognize the value of the old Eskimo ways.  She chooses to live alone in the wild, until she meets some people who tell her that her father is not dead.  She goes to find him, but thinks that he has forsaken the Eskimo ways, and is part of the kind of people that would kill her wolf father for sport.  In the end of the book, she sees that maybe the time of the Eskimos is past, and returns to her father.    I didn't care for this book too much, probably because it reminded me of Scott O'Dell's "The Island of the Blue Dolphins."  Then I realized that the same author wrote "My Side of the Mountain" which is the same kind of survival story.  It didn't seem to have all that much of a plot, and I didn't care for the part about Miyax's marriage, or the way she identified with the wolves.  I think it's because we as people are social creatures, designed to live with each other, not alone in isolation from other people.  We desire to have companions, and although dogs or other animals may be man's best friend, and solitude is necessary at times, it is hard for me to connect with a book like this.   
 Galactic decided to go with a big-name producer named Dan the Automator.  Dan the Automator took an amazing, explosive, quirky funk sound and gutted it of any soul it had.  I'm sure these songs sound good live, that is without Dan the Automator's overproduction and mixing (Drum machines over Stanton Moore?  For shame!  The horror!).  The album itself is flat except for a few high points - "Paint" is good, "The Beast" is funky enough, "Never Called You Crazy" is good, and "All Behind You Now" is a great song, or would be live.  That's about it.  The rest of the album varies from so-so to outright boring, and considering the amazing amount of talent Dan the Automator had to work with in Galactic that's a crime.    Crazyhorse Mongoose and Late for the Future are both far superior records 
 Gilles Kepel is a really bright person, but this is one terrible book.  His idea is that Muslims may reject violence as counterproductive and instead achieve the acceptance of their wisdom by convincing us all.  In return for accepting their wisdom, they will accept our advice to be non-violent about it.  As for those who reject the truth of what they have to say, well, they'll simply shame us all into accepting their wisdom.  Did I use the word wisdom a little too much?  If so, it is because I think this book needs more of it.  Much more of it.  Kepel never seems to get around to condemning Arab propaganda.  And in an age where the international information supply has been seriously contaminated by arbitrary antizionist untruths, I think this is a serious oversight.  First we see Kepel misrepresent the 2000 Intifada as the work of Sharon, who clearly provoked the Arabs by visiting the Temple Mount, and Arafat, who clearly provoked the Jews by killing them in bunches.  But this is nonsense.  Jewish members of the Knesset had been visiting the Temple Mount, which is Judaism's holiest site, on a regular basis.  If non-Muslims were to start a war just because an Arab leader visited the Kaaba, we'd all regard this as an absurd excuse.  Kepel just adds to the problem by pretending that this is reasonable.    This is a serious problem with the whole book, because truth is central to the theme.  If Muslims are going to support truth, they may get their way without violence.  If they are fighting truth, they will not be able to convince others or shame them into agreeing.  The only options left will be violence or apology.  The author is convincing when he says that Israeli settlements do annoy some Arabs.  Now, these settlements are on disputed land.  They ought to be as legal as Arab settlements.  But let's forget all that.  Let us think only of justice and truth and human rights.  Here is where Kepel falls apart.  He keeps implying that in a just world, Israel would be trimmed down to size.  And that even if the settlements are legal, if Israel had to fend for itself, without anyone supporting it or attacking it, the size of Israel would decrease to something more reasonable.    Kepel has it totally wrong.  Israel has over 6 million people and over 5 million Jews.  In a just world, all else being equal, Israel would be much bigger.  And this is the core of the problem.  The present size of Israel is not a crime against Nature.  If anything, it is like low tide at the beach: one is making a big mistake if one expects the water to recede from it for the rest of the day.  The author admits that some folks support Israel here.  But he blames this support on a few "neoconservatives," implying that they are fighting against reality.  The truth is that the Arab side is fighting against justice and reality, and that such a war can't be won in the long run.  Once Kepel avoids saying that in a just world, Israel would be much bigger, it is easy for him to present Muslim violence as the wrong means for antizionist Muslims to convince others of their essential reasonableness.  And in his discussion of Europe, he concludes that European Islam will emerge with a "universalist perspective, freed from the straitjacket of authoritarianism and corruption."  Now, I do admit that the author is a learned and intelligent person.  And he may be right!  But as far as I am concerned, he could not have made a less convincing case.    
 I guess success turned around for Sam Raimi in 2002 & 2004 with the two Spider-Man films, but first he created this "V" like character in this garage of a movie, I liked "V for Vendetta" but not this "Darkman" if want to see a badly burned viligante in a mask see "V for Vendetta" don't see "Darkman

 I don't know about the other songs but they have no right to make a Marilyn Manson song sound so bad, how dare they!!!! I am out raged! I love his version, wait, I love him too!! He he he!! He is gorgeous and very very sexy!! Now where was I? Oh yes, this album sucks big time, don't buy it other wise I will come after you and eat you, only kidding!!! Ha Ha Ha. Now you are probably going to buy it just to see if I will come after you because you think I am insane. Well I am telling you it is a mistake! It's your choice. Bye for now 
 I read the book since I am building a house soon.  The book gave very little useful information.  I have been doing my homework on building a home and consider myself above average home building knowledge, but nothing I have learned came from this book.  I took the book on vacation this summer to read at the beach and I finished it in a day.  If you have some type of home building knowledge, you do not need this book.  I can NOT think of ANYTHING positive to say.  I wish I had another book to read at the beach.  WASTE OF TIME.  
 This movie is so bad, Kids should not see it. It's like a kidergarden student wrote this movie! You know what they shouldve put in? How about characters not liscenced, bad guys, talking animals, and a better backstory. They shouldve called the movie "The Amazing Missing Dog Adventure", Which was probaly what they had in mind before they thought, "No wait! Make it about Arthur! We already ruiend Casper and Barbie, Now let's do the same thing with Arthur." And that's right, it's by Mainframe Entertainment

 I have waited almost two months and the book still hasnt been shipped. I am still waiting for it to arrive. I hope this book is worth waiting for... 
 this is NOT,i repeat NOT five stars!in all honesty it's more like 1.5 or 2 stars and i'm a big fan of slug & atmosphere.albums like overcast,godlovesugly,the felt project,and the dynospectrum album is much better than this.though the lyrics are thought provoking,but slug has been better,the production doesn't hold up.it's some of the weakest i've heard from rhymesayers.there's only a couple tracks that stand out,but i'd have to say "don't ever f**king question that" is the best.if you wanna hear slug at his best check out the dynospectrum album.slug spits classic verse after classic verse 
 I'll keep it short. While I respect Elizabeth Barber's expertise when it comes to ancient fabrics, I'm not convinced by her take on ancient myths 
 Had this book been the work of a novice Sci-Fi author it would have never seen print.   The story follows the life of one Lazarus Long, a character who is easy to see is only a thinly veiled cover for the author himself.  Lazarus is a character who is so convinced of his own personal superiority that late in his very long life he travels back in time so that he can father himself.  As further example of his self superiority he had himself cloned into twins of the opposite sex.  Twins that he later has sexual relations with.  Even the conscience mind of the artificially intelligent computer that controlled his space craft transferred itself into the engineered body of a woman so that it too could have sexual relations with Lazarus.  To make it further insulting the sexual advances of those characters is not of Lazarus' choosing but rather of their free will.  Indeed Lazarus fends off the sexual advances of his cloned twins until they reach the age of consent.  This reveals how shallow the author feels the drives and motives of others to be.       The story follows the life of Lazarus Long through a series of 'flashbacks' as the character struggles to find a reason to continue his existence.  Most of the flashbacks deal with how the character traveled about the Universe starting colonies on untamed worlds.  Each of these mini-stories is an equally self aggrandizing yarn about how Lazarus fathered virtually every child on the planet while single handedly delivering the worlds he founded from lawlessness, ignorance, and barbarism.  Among these 'gems' are such classic lines as 'there is only one way to comfort a widow' implying that the answer was sex.  Yes, among these stories there are a few meaningful bits of wisdom such as Heinlein's list of what things a man should be able to do.  To save you the grief of reading the book just to get to it I'll quote it for you below. . .        "A Man should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently and die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."                 - Robert A. Heinlein    Certainly I can agree with that.  These are abilities that every man should endevour to have to make himself complete.  But they are not the exclusive domain of men. Unfortunately this bit of wisdom is so embedded in mounds of garbage that reveal Heinlein's low esteem for women it is not otherwise worth excavating.  One comes away from this book knowing that the Author felt that women are worth nothing beyond serving as receptacles for a man's sexual needs.  Throughout the book examples are given of how a man should be able to do all of the above while women, conversely, are scarcely credited with the ability to do any of those things.  That this book was ever nominated for an award is a blemish on human history 
 This DVD has very little to offer and even at its attractive price, it's a waste of money.  Granted, I have done reading on meditation for years and have practiced sporadically.  Still, I don't believe you could get much less from a DVD than is available on this one.  There are detailed instructions on posture, hand position and the like.  That takes about three minutes.  I was very disappointed in the lack of in-depth instruction I would have expected from a DVD on meditation.  
 as a muslim, i find it very disturbing and insulting to read books or hear comments about how islam is being unfair to women. i am twenty years old and living in a muslim country in the gulf, i have never faced a problem of what some anti islam extriemists claim to exist. it is true that there are some islamic extriemists whogive a misleading idea of islam and muslims, but those are a minority. on the conterary, islam gives its women their full freedom within boundaries that keep them safe and respected from all those around them.     
 Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn't think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I kept falling asleep the first time. The script is very weak and thus so is the story, the  acting is flat. Most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from  existing documentaries (I have seen photographs of at least one scene), you  can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for  the movie are very poorly done. Don't waste your money, if you want to  watch it, rent it, don't buy it 
 I was excited last fall when I found out a new book on the life of Curt Flood was going to be published. How disappointed I was after reading the thin biography by Alex Belth.  Belth does little new research in the life and times of Flood. He relies upon material about his career in baseball, his fight players' rights and an oftentimes misunderstood/controversial life off the field that was already available to the public.  What especially demonstrates a lack of material outside the lines is Belth's over-reliance of play-by-play concerning Flood's baseball exploits. Instead of analysis of the man on the field of play, Belth goes to the stats book to reduce valuable pages in this thin text to nothing more than a baseball almanac.  The book reads as if it is a draft of a screenplay instead of a true exploration of a multi-dimensional figure that Flood was as a person and player. If nothing else, this was yet another case of a black man waging a battle against a white-dominated institution for the betterment of many.   But, Flood is as much a historical figure in the rising tide of black's demanding justice from the white power structure as he is an employee willing to risk his career in a labor dispute. Belth fails to juxtaposition both issues for that time in U.S. history.     For those seeking a better read on Curt Flood, you'll need to seek out the book he penned in the 1970s, which is as much an exploration/opinions of those times as it is autobiography.   And I hope that the future will bring a biography that is truly a holistic exploration of Curt Flood. 
 It's a good book it just askes me as a student to assume too much.  Some of the problems at the end of the chapters are incomplete.  If i was to go about my life as a ME assuming random stuff i would get sued to a point of non-existance.  This book does not teach good engineering practices 
 Christopher Catherwood, a professor affiliated with Cambridge University's Institute of Continuing Education, has written this book on the modern history of what has come to be called Iraq.  Putting Churchill's name into  the title makes the book so much easier to market to those Americans who react to Churchill's name with the same giddiness that any mention of the Beatles once elicited from teenage girls.  To his credit, Catherwood has tried to cut through the fog of ideology and propaganda to get to the bottom of what happened.  Unfortunately, his undertaking wasn't even close to successful.  For example, Catherwood claims that the oil companies had no way of being sure that Iraq had oil deposits at the time that the Iraqi boundaries were drawn.  This despite the fact that crude oil had been seeping up to the surface in Iraq since biblical times, when, because it was deemed a medicine, had been brought by caravan to such distant places as China.  Natural gas also made its way to the surface, and would catch fire in eerie flames that the Iraqis attributed to ghosts.  These indisputable facts utterly refute the world according to Catherwood that this book has to offer..  Catherwood implies that the British were only interested in Iraq's oil because of its military use - one almost hears undertones insisting that the British only wanted a platonic relationship - but neglects to mention the close ties between Shell Oil and the admiral who fanatically urged advocated that the Royal Navy transition to oil.  These ties were so close that some of his colleagues were convinced that he had some financial stake in the deal.  I could write further paragraphs in this vein.  Were I ever to write a book on a subject so shrouded in disagreement as Iraq's history, I would make sure to first talk with knowledgeable people from the region, and then consult the writings of academics.  Unfortunately Catherwood seems to only have done the latter, to his colossal book's detriment.  Clio must feel slighted.  The only reason I don't give the book a single star, is that there are even worse books on the subject 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 Mak'n Bacon made "bacon" for the company that sells this product. Cheesy material, but not cheap. Hard to get all the bacon cooked without the tray getting too warm. Of course after you use it, you can't return it for your money back. Easier and cheaper to use paper towels.   
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

      It starts out with this Mexican family illegally coming across the border into the United States. When they get to the U.S., they go to a labor camp in California. This first labor camp is probably the best one that they go to. The whole book is about this family moving around to different labor camps during different crop seasons. Every now and then, Francisco and his brother Roberto go to school. Along the way there are more people added to the family. The book doesn't really come to a good ending. It is also kind of hard to understand because it jumps three years into the future at times and then you don't know what's going on. 	This was a very good book at some times but most of the time the author put in way too many unnecessary details that make the book kind of boring. This book is exactly like it's sequel, Breaking Through. I would rate this book pretty low if like a lot of action.  
 I've never written a review before, but I feel compelled to this time.  It was just that bad.  I didn't have to finish it, I kept waiting for it to get better, when it did not I resigned myself to finishing it.  It wasn't that hard being a lightweight beach novel.  It was a rainy saturday so I figured why not - it was only mildly better than finishing the laundry.  I almost feel dumber for having read this.  Is this really what women RELATE to?  If so, that is so sad?  I found every character in this book just sad.  Mind you, I don't find the characters or the tale unbelievable, the tone that I should somehow empathize and root for true love.  C'mon!  Even for a book that isn't supposed to be intellectually challenging, it was nothing but a letdown.  F 
 Well, i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review.  Truthfully, i didn't catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could  care less about what happend.    The trailers and the DVD cover of this movie is very misleading.  One would think that they are going to see something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a group of people doing whatever it takes to survive.  I'm a big fan of Romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would be a cool australian take-off.  I couldn't be more wrong.  Nothing in the movie makes sense from the start.  The entire movie is over the top starting with the actors.  Everybody has entirely too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says two words during the entire movie.  She looks lost, confused, and out of her league.  Other characters include a local pilot and his pregnant girlfriend, a "wacky" police sgt with his asthmatic partner, the bait & tackle clerk who never screams during the entire movie, and our heroin character who won the local beauty contest.  The movie takes place in a small town in austrialia somewhere.  When meteors strike the earth (and slam into people), it unleashes a germ which causes people to become zombies.  Our main characters all meet up and try to survive.  However, aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around right in the middle of a big battle.  The viewer is left to wonder what's going on at first, but as the dialogue and story become unbearably bad, you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick by.  I honestly couldn't tell you much else because it's just so terrible that I just simply couldn't take a minute more.  Bad acting, bad dialogue, over the top effects, and some of the worst camera work i've ever seen.  This movie apparently took two years to make... imagine if they only had one???  Another portion of this movie that makes me ill is the bait & tackle charater.  He shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin's life like a bad clint eastwood impression (with big hat covering his eyes to boot).  Then, he walks away.  When he appears again, he's able to do these matrix style backflips (digging his "spurs" into the wall/ceiling) and making two pistols jump over his back and land directly into his hands.  Does this guy ever miss?  What do you think?  He manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two pistols while hanging from the wall upside down.  Not bad for a bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia!    If you dig the gore, this one is ok... but again, wayyyy over the top.  I had no idea that one bullet from a .45 could blow someone in half.  Our characters are so clueless that it actually takes them 3/4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the head.  I personally counted several scenes where a character is shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots out of a 6 shooter.  Someone get NASA on the phone and explain how you can do that because i just don't get it.    The absolutely worst part of this movie, without a doubt, is the music.  It never stops!  There's never a scene without music for some reason!  And it just makes what you're watching seem absolutely cheesy!  It reminded me of a 1950's serial/pirate swashbuckling kind of thing with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of thing.  The soundtrack is truly the worst i've ever heard with extra cheese included.  Did they use up their budget on the effects?  Probably!  I found myself wishing that i could mute the music during the film!    If you're a fan of good monster / zombie movies, i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving.  It doesn't make sense, the story is amazingly weak, the plot is... well, there isn't one... you'll wish you could have your 2 hours back.  I know i do!!!  
 I have been advised by those who help others prepare for the CSET that this is not a good study guide.  So much information and so overwhelming and not all the answers are accurate.  I studied the books What your 6-8th grader needs to know.....I did that for math, geography, ca history etc etc and passed the CSET on the first try.  I am not young..almost 50 
 After reading this book it became obvious to me that the author has many unresolved issues with her religious life and with Christianity.  Even though she sheds some insight about whom or what MM was, she did so in a negative and sometimes condescending  way.    I was somewhat hurt by the character assignation she did on JC.  Obviously, she had made Jesus an idol of worship instead of the holy man he was and therefore took it upon herself to shatter that idol in this book.  The very thing she blames the Church in doing - making Jesus an idol - she has done herself.  The Jesus she spoke of in this book is not the Jesus I have come to know and love.  It is very easy to take words out of context and use them in a way to indicate hostility when in effect no hostility was meant.  It is easy to come to false conclusions and premises when one's perception is skewed by one's personal beliefs and emotions.  Jesus was human, but that does not take away from the divination of his being.  If Jesus was so humanly perfect then it would conclude that none of us could ever walk in his footsteps.  None of us would have a chance of experiencing heaven. That is ludicrous. 
 I am way disappointed in these sheets I just got them and read the instructions on how to wash them and I did so, I put them on my bed and they feel like paper. I thought they were supposed to be soft???? they are 800 thread count but I am new at this. maybe if I keep washing them they will get bette 
 I don't know about other company, but Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture.  I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3, but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic.  There is no leather on the case at all. Not only that, the cover smells like petroleum oil 
 I thought I was getting a SET of forks NOT one fork. The picture and description are deceptive. The picture depicts a set(s) I am sure the ONE fork I got is great but I have 5 other hands that need a fork as well

 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
  Ok now I am afraid to try any other Our Gang DVDs! No one mentions how poor the sound is, so that it it almost impossible to understand what is being said! This made this DVD worthless in my opinion 
 This book is crap. If you want to read 254 pages of contradicting theories backed up by little to no fact, this is the book for you. The one interesting and revelatory thing that I did pick up from this book is that the work produced by modern physicists is largely insubsantial and speculatory. The theories presented to explain space and time are no better than those created by those ancient Greek thinkers and philosophers who happened to have been proven wrong about things, or perhaps those of your average back-alley lunatic. These physicists, who should more likely be called sophists, simply pull from their anterior regions fantastic, thouroughly imaginitive structures to apply to the workings of the universe, simply because they truly have no legitimate answers.   Seriously, I'm an average guy, though fairly well educated, and I'm telling you, if you're the snooty, self-important type of intellectual who likes to make up smart sounding stuff (yeah, I said "stuff") just for the sake of sounding intelligent, and would like to read this book simply for the sake of self-indulgence, then you've found the perfect read. Otherwise, steer clear of this long, boring, and incredibly redundant pile of feces 
 It's a great calendar for the Mary E. fan.  Lots of cute pictures and her classic sayings 
 I personally have not taken this diet pill; however I am compelled to note the descriptions from folks stating that they felt "trippy" "weird" and "out of sorts". Britney Spears had been taking this stuff for a while...then as we all know she went all "postal", shaved her head, attacked photographers and just all around went out in left field and didn't return.....and we wonder why she did it...hummmm... None the less, the side effects like those reported I've seen personally from close friends. They should re-name this diet pill Asylum-X, because that's where you'll be. Diet pills like these have a negative effect on the seratonin in your spinal fluids, and I don't know about you but I'm not comfortable with something altering my state of being....just something for you to "swallow" 
 I am currently studying in a naturopathic program and am constantly purchasing new books on alternative health, not just for cancer, but other disorders. That being said, I have accumulated quite a library. After reading this book, though it has some worthwhile info in it, I have several other books that are far better, written by alternative health physicians or nurses who are more qualified to discuss these topics and have more experience dealing with cancer patients. They also have a great deal more information in them. This book leaves out some really important up-to-date treatments, though it does cover some of the older remedies. 
 I'm not usually so critical, but I was utterly disappointed in this book. The title is misleading. The '45 plans' mentioned in the title were not plans at all. They were at best 'general arrangements'. While overall dimensions were given, most 'plans' barely mention materials of construction and certainly didn't include an actual bill of material. Some of the illustrations were little more than crude, badly proportioned hand sketches.  I guess I expected more from someone who felt they were qualified to write a book. I would have to guess that this is the authors first book. Apparently the publisher wasn't paying any attention during this project. A synopsis of the book might read "throw some scrap material together and give it a cutsie name...I'll include it in my next book!! 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 Bo was my favorite Idol contestant last year.  So, I couldn't wait to get his first album.  Before this album came out, I was going to buy the two song CD, with Vehicle and Inside Your Heaven, but I didn't buy it because I figured, why waste my money on only 2 songs.  I figured the album would be better.   I was wrong.  When my daughter and I listened to the CD for the first time, we were dissapointed.  Every song sounds pretty much the same  - white washed cookie cutter pop.   The cd has been sitting around my van unlistened to every since.  I was hoping to hear some Southern rock style or classic rock style tunes or something at least close to that.  Maybe it's because he's new to the industry and hasn't figured out how to work the business yet.  I hope he changes and gets some real good music out soon. 
 To say that Islam tolerates Homosexuality is a very humorous claim indeed. This author focuses on practices done by corrupt muslims who do not even read their own book. The Quran numerously talks about Homosexuality, Condeming it over and over. First it warns the men not to leave their wives and go for other men. Another verse states How God dealt a destructive Force (severe storms) on the People of "Lot" that instantly killed all their inhabitants as punishment for such a sinful act. Then there are the VAST testimonies of Homosexual muslim who choose not to engage in Homosexual acts and lead a Heterosexual life in order not to Sin in the name of God. I could go on, this is so pathetic that it's not even worth my time reviewing this. MY ADVICE, BEFORE YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING SOMEONE SAYS OR WRITES ABOUT, do your own independant research to see if the author is honest or just a fanatic. In this cas go read what the Quran really says about homosexuals 
 Seems like they sold too many of the first volume, and have produced a second just to try to rake in a little more. Hardly any of the tracks on this album are funk, and as for Queen being the opener... it speaks for itself. To me, funk is typified by an active bass line, compelling beat and sharp guitar or brass; any or all of these are lacking on most of the tracks here. What you get instead is a collection of slothful, disparate songs, hardly conducive to dancing. Save your money 
 I don't get why this CD is such a big deal other than it was the first CD that Massive attack released. I consider myself a massive attack fan, but it just sounds very outdated to me. Don't get me wrong. There are a few songs that point to group becoming excellent in the future. Five man Army is great. So is blue lines, and Safe from harm is alright for sounding like early 90's dance, but other than that I didn't care for it.   
 To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations. Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not? I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative! Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists. 
 I don't remember when last I read any prose that comprises of mainly adjectives! I was constantly groping for my red pen to edit out the superfluous ones. Of course, descriptions are necessary but the overabundance here completely defeats the purpose. I can't describe what I mean better than to quote Jane Austen: "Every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind." So also Durrell. The excess of words and descriptive expressions, intended no doubt to paint vivid images in our minds, hamper the reader instead of creating a stage for the drama about to unfold. We are lost among the brushes, pigments and paint tubes, never getting far away enough to see the whole painting. I usually 'disappear' into literature but when reading this man's words I can't for a moment forget that I'm reading 
 I am a moderate guitar player ( with a Hamburg type Rickenbacker guitar) and wanted to learn a little more about the guitar cords used in Beatle songs. I am not afraid to tell that I don't understand anything. If you haven't learned   music theory for at least some years at school this book could be a dissapointment for you as it turned out to be for m 
 This product is a waste of time! Don't bother. The handheld game is entertaining for my daughter, but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least! Once connected, we walked around the "virtual world" with nothing to do. It is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone. There are much better products out there for children that are similar, but easier to play with. I would suggest Webkinz or Neopets. These 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play, unlike the Muichiz site! Good luck.. 
 Hawthorne Heights is just a horrible and desperate attempt in trying to fit in with the whole emo trend. The lyrics are WAY to simple and pointless. This CD isn't completely horrible, but I would still reccommend that you buy another CD such as:   *Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge - My Chemical Romance *Define The Great Line - Underoath *Liberation Transmission - Lostprophets *Hours - Funeral For A Frien 
 I had to force myself to finish this book. After reading two-thirds I felt compelled to finish it simply in hopes of finding some redeeming value to the time I'd already invested.  Upon finishing the book (unlike the insightful and eloquent analysis by the Reader in New England) I shut the book and said, "This is the stupidest book I have ever read!"  After calming down a little I began to wonder if perhaps Wise Blood represented Flannery's life and emotions?  One has to imagine being stricken with a debilitating disease that eventually robbed her of life at a young age must have tortured her to some degree.  She must have wondered where is God in all this without being able to deny Him.  Could Hazel represent Flannery? A life of seeming despair, allowed to waist away slowly in a drainage ditch only to be finally found yet treated with complete disregard and with utter contempt by the police sent to rescue and redeem Haze (Flannery) by thumping him (her) on the head with a death blow without any apparent feelings.  Was Flannery making a statement about being treated thus by God?  Is it possible Flannery used Wise Blood as a cathartic for her own emotions towards God for the cards she'd been dealt?  I don't say that judgmentally in the least.  It just makes sense now that I am calm enough to think about it. I'm hardly qualified to dish out such psycho-babble.  Basically, I still agree with the New England reader in terms of regretting the read.  Perhaps this story will have more meaning should I face personal suffering and loss like Flannery.  Faith does not make one immune to the multi-levels of agony.  This story was agonizing 
 Edward Burns is a talented actor, but as a writer/director he seems to specialize in myopic boorish "male chick flicks" (McFlicks?). Halfway through this film I thought ,"hey,noone's going to give me back those 45 minutes" and put the DVD back in the box. You've seen it all before,and if you care about these shallow cliched characters,perhaps you'll have a good time (watching the film was like being with relatives you don't care for). Me,I'll look for him in "Private Ryan" and kick myself for opening the DVD! 
 Take the first 20 minutes of the movie and then imagine another 1.5 hours of the same:  guy drinks, guy gets job, guy loses job, guy mistreats girl along the way.  Dillon's character is unlikable, predictable, and just plain boring.  This, combined with the absence of plot, makes for a painful viewing experience 
 This book depends upon (count'em) five works from the nineteenth century, all of which have been debunked by scholars. It is a wonderful fantasy. If you like reading fantasy, and can accept it as such, it will be a great book for one to read.   However, ask yourself what has happened to Hal Lindsey in the last 36 years: he made a fortune, now owns several homes and luxury cars. Strange way, don't you think, for one to show his belief that the end is near 
 These metaphysical wet dreams will delight sulky teenagers and juveniles of all ages, but adults will agree with Rimbaud's own judgement: "It's all slop."  The Varese translation leaves most of the (rumored) music behind in the original French;  what remains is the prose end of the prose-poem equation.  I found these pieces supremely boring.  Perhaps if I cared about the Rimbaud myth I would read these with different eyes-- but I don't, and therefore what I find is faux passion and histrionic hormones.  Add a stilted English to this mixture and the result is malodorous.  Not recommended 
 This shonky production gives a new dimension to the term 'exploitation'. The DVD cover lists the running time as 85 minutes. It isn't. The total running time of the disc is 73 mins. To compound the deceit the running time of the story, such as it is, is a mere 59 mins. The balance of the time is taken up with a 14 min credit crawl. That's longer than the credit crawls for Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments combined. It's painfully slow and is plainly done for the sole purpose of padding out the disc. Don't waste your time looking for the director's commentary and Behind The Scenes mentioned on the cover. They're nowhere to be found. A complete disgrace 
 I hate this book. I wanted the apocylipse, i wanted world war watever the people in that book had gotten to. I wanted the Phalanx Nations to reign death and destruction upon the unsuspecting populous of Yonwood. Instaed, i got a crazy old lady, and even crazier old lady who should be arrested, and a whole town full of otherwise crazy people, acceptign a few people of course. 
 The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it 
 The exam changed may-june 2006,  as a well focused book it is now out of focus.  A more general book over SBS,  like  SBS 2003 Unleashed is more helpfull, although not enough concerning Exchange and some aspects of Windows 2003 
 Although the designs are full page illustrations, the areas to be colored are incredibly small.  They would be challenging for an adult.  Don't even consider using them with children 
 This DVD is great for learning the steps, and good for beginners. However the "performance" sections do not show proper technique and give poor examples of how the dances should be performed. They truly are not worth watching.   Elsa's movements in all but the Flamenco are not true to form and not in the least bit fluid, they are jerky and spasmodic. I love performances and these made me nervous to watch and I felt embarrassed for her. I'm stunned that they were included and I'm questioning the professionalism of company who published this DVD 
 I have read several of Ann Rule's books and enjoyed them all, but I did not like this one. This was fiction and dragged on. She had a similar short story among one of her collections, which I enjoyed. I did not like this ending, it would not have turned out that way. I ended up not liking any of the charaters 
 This guy is the biggest poser.  The only people that gave him good reviews were his family members or friends.  This guy really sucks 
 The material is good. However, the lay out is too confusing. I could not understand after going over it 3 times 
 While the price for this HTS is very nice, the performance is substandard.  There's a hissing sound when the unit is off.  The DVD player has trouble playing DVDs.  I have a large DVD collection & most of them don't play.  The surround quality is also very poor. It's a stretch to call it surround sound when half of the speakers don't put out much sound.  In order to get this serviced, I have to send it out for up to 3 months.  I bought a progressive DVD player, put the audio through the Phillips HTS 3400 and the video to the TV and suddenly the picture was better and the sound was better.   
 I bought the four pack of these pillows and kept finding the pillows thrown in other rooms.  My husband informed me that he hates the pillows.  They are not soft, and are crunchy and loud when you lie on them.         
 To violent for anyone! This movie is horrible. The cast is good, but the plot stinks! Its just this family who have super powers. Then this kid wanted to be Mr. Incredibles side kick. (in a way)Mr. Incredible says no so then he hates him. Then the kid turns evil and kills people, and wants every body to like him. Thats origanal. There are barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes, and there is way to much violence. Killing, guns, punching, bombs, and they say stupid words sometimes. I do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence. So I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Especially the 2 disc special edition! 
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 I bought this book in anticipation of Meier's extended coverage of the Chechen conflict. What I did not know when I purchased this book, nor was mentioned anywhere on the reviews or on the cover, is that THIS BOOK IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE CHAPTER ON CHECHNYA IN BLACK EARTH.  In essense, I feel scammed.  Do not buy this book if you already own Black Earth.  You'll find out by page one that this is just a chapter taken out, repackaged and sold as a separate book.  I could not believe it when I read the first few pages--this is absolutely shameful.  Did the publishers and Andrew Meier think that the reading public is so stupid and so memory lapsed that we would not see this right away?  I do not appreciate the fact that I spent extra money on an unnecessary and misrepresented book 
 I bought this book b/c it made the NYT Book Review list of top novels, but the author began the novel crying that slick willie was treated oh so unfairly by we churchgoing middle-America do-gooders (I am a Southern moderate who despises the Clintons for what they are - common trash) But it isn't the politics, per se, that that turned me away from the novel, I just find it hard to believe that such temporal political whinnying can be a prelude to a work of any depth, or even a mark of a serious novelist.  And so I don't want to waste my time with it.  I did like the top ranked novel, though, Beloved.  Couldn't put it down 
 I love this movie! It is so incredibly stupid and funny. It is absolutely ridiculous and slightly crass. The grinch and the whos look like a bunch of clowns. The film was predictable and completely ripped off from the animated TV special. This isn't as stupid as Barney, because at least the makers of this film actually tried to be funny, rather than just childish and retarded. This film has gotten a lot of mixed reviews on amazon.com, so be sure to rent it before you buy it. 
 I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
 This book includes a few not-very-clear paragraphs about motise and tenon joints. Not clear? for instance, it does not tell you how to hold your rolly willow branches still while you drill. Other than that, it expects that you will hold your furniture together with nails, or sometimes screws. To my way of thinking, this is not really furniture 
 Don't waste you money on this one - not worth it 
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
 This got to be the most egotistical and arrogant book ever writted. The author in about every paragraph, uses words like "I", "me" and when refering to another person and himself, he always puts his name first. Bhagwati loves to name drop, he lists people he has met as if its a popularity contest. Bhagwati's writting will confuse you and annoy you. Throught out the book he loves to advertise the papers and studies he has written, they have no relavence to the topic at hand except maybe to help him sell more books 
 This is a total waste of your time, IMHO. You know you are going to get three page chapters and lots of white space, but Parker usually manages to tell you a story and often quite well. Not this time.  Spencer meanders around and around while everyone lies to him about what he is investigating, he and Susuan have some snappy chat, he and Hawke much less so and then the book is over in a very forced and unsatisfying way. You wait and wait for the story to pick up and get interesting, but it never does.   Pass on this one 
 In a nutshell, you have a very slender woman whose spine is as flexible as overcooked spahgetti doing some very intense stretching for an hour, in her underwear.    One of the exercises had her squatting down, looping her arms behind her legs, grabbing her ankles and breathing in and out like she was giving birth to twins.  I guess that's some kind of mystical thing but I since I couldn't do it, I just sat down on the couch and laughed at it.  I sat on the couch for most of it.  If I were twenty, had her figure and her degree of flexibility, I would probably rate this production 4 or 5 stars; it is that good.  However, if you have trouble tying your shoes, this DVD ain't for you! My recommendation for us older folks is Pilates Complete for Inflexible People with Maggie Rhoades. It's a whole lot easier than this 
 If you have read about the Civil War in depth you will find this book maddening. The stories lurch between naming the regiments in a battle line to skipping over large portions of each battle. There seems to be no rhyme or reason in the approach to the information. I suppose I expected a battlefield book that would give me a topographical feel for the battle where in reality the bulk of the book is a synopsis of larger events and in some cases the battles themselves.  Another problem I had with the book is the general point of view that the Yankees were a bunch of bumbling drunkards who by happenstance were successful and the Confederates, especially Lee, were brilliant, noble leaders who at critical moments the fates intervened to ruin their otherwise perfect battle plans. I literally had to reread the last page of the Gettysburg chapter four times to finally come to the conclusion that the author states the Lee won the battle! 
 I LOVE her cake mix dr books but hate this one. Every recipe I have tried has been awful. I don't cook with many prepared/boxed foods so maybe it is not a fair judgement. I love the idea of the book for when things are crazy and you want to make something fast and easy but the flavor of the dishes are really bad 
 If you are an avid Jance fan and have come to like and expect fast-paced action and lots of excitement from the "Beaumont" books, don't buy this one.  I usually can't quit reading a Beaumont book.  I've stayed up well past my bedtime on many, many, many occasions because I just couldn't put the book down.  I will usually spend hours reading the whole book in one setting.  But this book.....well, it just doesn't cut it.  I've started and stopped it on several occasions to read something else and only came back to it when I needed "filler" reading.  For one thing, several characters have undergone major personality changes.  Beverly, who was previously sort of a mousy, quiet, obedient character has suddenly become fiesty and mouthy and full of independence.  And I scarcely recognized Lars. And the plot is too contrived and the whole Kiksadi, Quicksady, Quixote thing is really stupid.  If this is the first Beaumont book you've read, please read some of the older books.  You will enjoy them.  But don't read this one 
 After taking my dog to a true dog behaviorist, he told me that  Cesar's "style" is something I should not adopt.  His "one size fits all...gotta show 'em who's boss" mantra is completely wrong.. My dog behaviorist is renowned in this part of the country and gives seminars on dog behavior in Japan, as well. He also heads the training for dogs who are taken into our local hospitals. I trust him completely... so I definitely question now what Cesar the "dog whisperer" has to offer. The person I am working with operates solely on the "reward" system.  
 When I bought this book I did not realize that it was written after the movie.  It is not good Graham Greene.  The book follows the movie closely but, it adds very little.  As I read the story I miss the music.  Save your money and buy the DVD 
 This is a badly written book due to the attempt of using Ivy League elucidations for topics that should be told straightforward in terms of simple language. It also doesn't help to use end-of-the-book topics as examples or part of discussions in the early part of the book. In the end, this book causes more damage and confusion for someone attempting to learn the basic concepts of accounting for the first time. I'm embarrassed. 
 Some talented DVD editor should take the latest 3 movies, and cut out the dumb scenes (about 75% of each movie) and put them all together to make one decent movie 
 I have read and re-read all three books on numerous occasions, hoping to find the hidden, deeper reasoning behind it.  In these readings, I eventually find myself skipping past the long diatribes of why this submission is so rewarding to some of them, and just reading the tawdry gay and lesbian sex. And yes, there is a LOT of spanking. If you are interested in learning about BDSM, stay away from these books, as they do no more than confuse the hell out of you.  I agree with the other reviewer, that I'm fairly certain this was not the socioeconomic trials of Medieval Europe. 
 I've heard good things about this book so I was honestly expecting to like it.  However I really was disappointed and surprised because after the third chapter the book gets boring and very repetitive.  And because it was written by Brooke Shields, the book sold.  But really, if an unknown wrote this book it would not have gone anywhere.  I also got the feeling that because Brooke Shields suffered PPD, she thought it is was so almighty important that she needed to write a book about it.  I'm sorry but I don't think that a person who goes through depression for only a few months has suffered all that much.  There are unfortunately millions of people who are poor, without health insurance, and worse without support of family and friends, that keep their depression going on for years and years and their entire lives are destroyed by this illness.  No one cares about them.  That is the saddest fact about depression in this country.    However Brooke Shields had millions of dollars to pay for help, a famous name that allowed her to write a book all about it, a career that people would die for (her lack of talent doesn't seem to have affected her career much), and most importantly a husband and friends to help her out.  She also had a doctor calling her every day which I've never heard of before!  Try being without all those things when you're suffering depression.  Trying to beat depression without love and resources is like trying to drive a nail into a board with a feather.  I was a bit annoyed that Brooke Shields was oblivious to all this in her book.  And Tom Cruise only brought more attention to the book with his rant about medications.  I admire Tom Cruise - he is certainly far more talented than Brooke and I believe his comments about her career angered her more than anything.  However he is not a doctor and he does not know what he is talking about!!!!  The book's writing is very mediocre and the people who buy the book live under very different circumstances than the author, so it's hard to get much out of it.  This book only sold because it was about Brooke Shields 
 I would never read a book with a picture of the author on the cover 
 I agree w/ T. Morrey's review "Worst publishing I have ever seen, February 7, 2005".  I haven't even read the book yet, so this isn't a review of the content but rather the quality of the "publication" itself.  The book I received -- and paid $20 for -- appears to be a crude copy of an original publication, so far as I can tell.  I very much doubt that the copy I received is true a HarperCollins publication.  Looks more like a photocopy.  I'll be trying to get my money back for this one 
 I guess I'm astonished that anyone would give this book more than one star. While Mr. Moyers clearly makes the profound point that, "half measures avail naught" when trying to achieve sobriety, his current attitudes would seem to convey continuing beliefs that contradict this point.   His "dark humor" did not conceal lingering bitterness, starting with the very quote chosen for the jacket regarding his dad's alleged statement that he hated William C. There is a sad and frustrating mixture of growing insights, stated wryly, followed with what could only be read as continued self pity, resentment, blame and excuses.  The point that Mr. Moyers makes- addictions are a disease and are beyond the scope of reason or direct control once they reach a particular stage is convincingly expressed. The short commercial near the end, to increase public awareness, seems like an afterthought, and indeed, serves to soften the tone of the book.  Even as substance abuse counselor and avid participant of the 12 Step Program of Recovery, I could not help but be bored by the author himself. He seems, still, a tiresome, brooding man, utterly obsessed with his father, still stuck and highly reactive, as evidenced by the constant references to his father's mishandling of events.  He wonders what would have happened if his parents had sought treatment more aggressively for him early on? He speculates about their role in his melanoma-identifying himself as a cancer victim? He manages to be both facetious about his unrealistic expectations regarding his father's performance, alternating with harsh judgments and criticisms that sound ridiculous at best.  His supportive spouse winds up severely depressed, recently, and eating disordered?  Small wonder.  I don't know when I have been more disappointed with, even embarrassed by, what could have been an important memoir. To have had parents and family such as Mr. Moyers has, to have little to complain about beyond being asked to participate in Scouting, is an affront and assault upon the splendid Mr. and Mrs. Bill Moyers.  It is obvious that in picking apart almost all of his dad's lovely letters, William Cope Moyer's attempt to individuate is still in its infancy.  One cannot be acquainted with the character and work of the senior Moyers without feeling the heartbreak that Bill must have felt at reading his son's remarks. Joy at William's enduring recovery may overshadow this sad book, which I believe would have been much better left unpublished, unread. Having an unusual name is hardly a point to be repeatedly made in this highly repetitious and bitter book. If addictions are indeed a disease, they hardly need justification, much less this explaination.     
 I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful 
 IT'S A REAL SHAME & COMPLETE IDIOCY THAT NUMBER 1, THIS SHOW ISN'T SOLD AS A SEASON PACKAGE & NUMBER 2, THAT THEY CAN'T SELL IT AT AN AFFORDABLE RATE.  For example, if there was a dvd that had a complete season for around $20 or a dvd that had the complete seasons 1-3 for no more than $40-50, this would make sense. It was a great show, but come on now lets be sensible & reasonable about thi 
 I haven't received it yet and have been trying to email Amazon with no luck, It was sent on 3rd Dec to Australia They promised to deliver by the 22 Dec if I bought before 4th Dec so I don't think I will ever buy a book from Amazon again. No book no revie 
 In installed this product on a Dell Optiplex GX110 (admittedly not the latest, but still a very standard machine) running Windows 2000 with 512MB of memory. In spite of spending literally hours with the software I was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse, as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video. Without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls. Multiple emails to Broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that I refer to their Website for help. This site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems (like not being able to read the install CD).  It would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver. Be prepared for possible frustrations with this product, with little support from the manufacturer. I cannot report on other features of the software because I was never able to produce even the walls of a structure 
 The best way I can describe these guys are 50 cent lyrics without Dre's beats.  All these guys talk about is going to the club, sex, and guns.  Their flow isn't anything special and the songs are extremely repetitive.  The majority of their beats are low off key minor notes with some handclapping mixed in.  One of their more popular songs is "stomp and clap."  They stomp and clap 50 times and shout out to ATL, the west coast, and new york... Wow, that's a good one guys.  I'm stomping this cd out of my collection and I suggest everyone avoids this cd as well 
 This book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998!!!  Totally out of date! Useless!! Wondering why it is still for sale.  The author, contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked, simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one...  Outrageaous!  Spread the word and if you own the book, get your money back 
 The title to this book is truly misleading.  All the book talks about are physical things (as opposed to ideas or thoughts) from Central Asia that were documented to have appeared in Tang China.  The author has some interesting findings (on pronunciations and etymology, but the rest of the book is disappointing.  Each of the 18 chapters is titled by one physical item (Men, Animals - domestic and wild, Birds, Furs, plants, woods, foods, aromatics, drugs, textiles, pirgments, minerals, jewels, metals, secular objects, sacred objects).  The author basically did a search through a database of Tang Chinese writings and noted all the imports that fitted into the 18 categories.  Not worth it 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 Another product of Hollywood's "Karaoke Culture".  In an age where we see cinematic remakes of every kind, we have in "U-571" an outrageous attempt to borrow from the success and acclaim of "Das Boot".  But instead of a gripping war drama that reveals the tragic waste of war, we get a cheap flag-waving pile of Hollywood propaganda. The lighting, camera angles and claustrophobic set are obviously inspired by DB. But the bigoted innacuracies (German submariners machine gunning helpless sailors) and absurd scenarios (an incredibly lucky stern shot sinks a destroyer in hot pursuit) put this ridiculous movie in its own category. U-571 is just another thin, over-promoted, throw-away movie you'll forget the day after you see it 
 "seems to say almost everything" is correct but it really says virtually nothing 
 I read history books to learn all about world history and I expect this to be an enjoyable experience. I bought this book because the other reviewer gave it 5 stars. I guess I am looking for a Reader's Digest version of this series of wars that explains everything in layman's terms (and it wouldn't hurt if there was a little excitement or inspiration in it). I am next going to read the Seward book on this subject (because it is inexpensive and it has 5 stars ratings) and then I will compare the 2 books. No one should buy this book if it is only your first or second book on the 100 Years War and you are not a history student and dont know that much about French and English history. This book was just very boring. After I read the Seward book, I will re-read this book and see if I can give it more stars or not 
 The Scott Pace essay is throught-provoking in how he relates space commerce as being driven by information markets, not by government contracts for aerospace hardware. Equally thought-rovoking is the work of Chris Chybra's essay relating to The Search for Extraterrstrial Life and how it is shaping NASA policies in astrobiology. The book contains interesting nuggets of observation. It was an easy yet delightful read. Henry Lambright is to be commended for bringing together a book in what is an ever changing sector. 
 To put it bluntly, the DVD freezes up many times throughout the movie.  I've sent messages to the seller without any replies.  I would not recommend making any purchases from this company.   
 Jackson's ego is so overinflated that true knowledge of beer is obscured by his presence.  This book is boring, silly, and a waste of money.  It is also, like its author, shockingly overrated 
 I don't want it.  I sent it back today.  Please deduct it off my credit card 
 Feinman is the classic leftist infecting American higher education today who is now worried that the game may be up. This book is probably the best example of elitist arrogance whining about how they can't deal with judicial law-making when it goes against their view of the world. "The common law" as leftist elitists like Feinman define it is the law written by fellow judicial activists who write laws that would never pass muster by a majority of the people, or their elected representatives. They invent unwritten rights with their decisions, and transform American society into something that could never happen if it weren't for activists like Feinman and his leftist ilk. Now that the conservatives are doing exactly what Feinman's fellow travelers have done over the last few generations, it is somehow "rolling back" the "Common Law". this book is a great instruction on how the judiciary has become the nightmare of some of our founding fathers who worried that this "least important" of the three branches of government has arrogated to itself powers never envisioned by them. I recommend reading this book as one of the best examples of liberal arrogance that can be found.  
 This item is totally uncomfortable to sit on and makes your back ache horribly.  Also it does not work well at all.  If you have difficulty rising from a seated positon this item will not help in the least. Many times it stays flat and when it does "rise" it only occurs after you push up yourself with your arms and legs. I would have returned the item, but I left it for my mother when I had to be out of town for a few weeks and by the time I returned my 30 day window was closed.  DO NOT BUY, you will regret it if you do. I won't even put this item in a yard sale, because I would not subject anyone to false hope and a back ache to go along with it.  
 Bought this from amazon.  Worked well for compact flash cards.  Always complained that i should format the card whenever i used multimedia card (from kodak camera).  so i was never able to use it to transfer pictures from a kodak camera.  And all of a sudden, it died on me.  Had to throw it out 
   The forms are useless since when you copy them they contain the page numbers and chapter title from which you obtained them from. You can obtain better "legal" forms via softcopy methods(CD-ROM) internet so don't waste your time(trying to doctor the copies) and money on this book.. I will provide you mine for free 
 It is just a book collecting different material from Microsoft's Technet, how-to and white paper. The difference is that you can get info at MS site free and they offer better explanation. l also regretably purchase another Syngress book titled Windows2000 TCP/IP.  l will not buy any Syngress book anymore 
 Why is this in with the veggie books?  Veggies don't eat turkey or Cornish hens 
 This is supposed to be "the" bible on Access. And it is; it has everything there's to know. BUT, if you need to get your answers fast in order to get your work done, don't buy this book. This book, as well as other "bibles" series, are design with a whole CD program with sample exercises. If you go thru them, step by step, you'll learn your stuff. But, if you just need to get into the topic of getting something done quickly, you will find that their explanation is EXACTLY AS THE HELP FUNCTION ON THE SOFTWARE. And then, they will give you an example from that CD program. Believe me, if you don't want to go thru the whole reading process and just need answers in a need basis, this book won't do it. The same applies to the Excell Bible.. 
 This book is simply amazing. I loved it. It is exquisitely provactive and moving. Jenny keeps me laughing with her talented and humorous writing. I couldn't get enough. I learned so much about changing genders, family, and my own views and oppinions. This is a must read. 
 I don't for a second believe that Burroughs is telling the truth about his life -- but I gobbled up his other books anyway.  He's funny and there's something endearing about the way he writes -- yes he's gay, and yes that necessarily "colors" his worldview -- but talking about a job you hate, a family you loathe, and a partner who amazingly tolerates you are necessarily universal.  That said, he lapses here.  This isn't as approachable a book and the narrator is isn't so much funny as he is unlikeable.  By turns smug and arrogant, too much of this feels self-indulgent.  Chafingly, distractingly so 
 The advice in this book is solid and appropriate for most kids. However, the writer's attitude is judgmental. If you are buying this book, it's probably because your child's eating has not gone as smoothly as you'd like. For most of us, a lot of our parental self-esteem is wrapped up in this issue. So it just makes no sense to act as if it's usually the parent's fault - why alienate and beat up your target audience???? Plus, while I'm sure that some parents contribute to kids' eating issues, plenty of kids are just born more sensitive! If you can read between the lines and get to the take home message without letting her attitude get to you, more power to you - otherwise, go elsewhere. 
 Maybe this is not fair, to write a review without even seeing the DVD.  I wanted to make sure Disney understands that people do read these reviews, and I am not buying this DVD, as Swamp Fox is incomplete!  Three out of Eight episodes is hardly a reason to purchase 
 I bought this book hoping for some help to make a difficult decision. I was horrified by the authors irresponsible choice of using a relationship book to promote her religious views on divorce. All the book did was repeatedly say that no matter how miserable you are in your marraige and how emotionally damaging your relationship is that divorce is the worst evil and to stay together no matter what. It tells readers that divorce is the most miserable thing and that no matter how horrible your marriage may be that divorce is worse. I found the book to be offensive and dangerous for women who are in abusive relationships who are being told that it is better to stay and be abused than to go against god and destroy your family. 
 You can find the information on the internet or from any place that sell hardwood. I thought the book would show you to do special thing, but ... nothing useful 
 At 163 pages, "Wildlife" is more of a novella than anything else and about as dry as the scorched Montana landscape.  The biggest problem is not so much the story, but the way the story is told.  In some cases, the impersonal first-person narrator works, as in "The Great Gatsby", but in others like "Wildlife" or "A Prayer for Owen Meaney", the narrator is such a nonentity that they don't add anything to the story and act only as a buffer that prevents the audience from really getting to know the other, more important characters.  The story, if you don't know, is that when narrator Joe's father loses his job as a golf instructor, he goes into the forest to help fight a wildfire.  While he's gone, Joe's mother has a fling with an older local businessman, Warren Miller, but whether this was already going on before Joe finds out is unclear.  When Joe's father returns from the fire, his mother moves out for a while.  And that's it.  In this case Joe (complete with dull name) has no friends, no ambitions, and few (if any) opinions to share.  He's no one I could ever care about, because his only function seems to be as a recording device to report the activities of his parents to us readers.  The parents, as though aware of this, speak in an unnatural way to always indicate to us what they are feeling or thinking.  It's the problem I've had with all of Ford's books, including the Pulitzer-winning "Independence Day".  Some writers are able to write convincing dialogue and others (like Ford) are not.  It's hard to say much about "Wildlife" because there's so little to it.  There's not a lot of action, drama, or passion and the story itself isn't much that we haven't already seen before.  Again, the story told through Joe the buffer keeps us from really learning anything about the characters and that prevents us from feeling sympathetic towards their plight.  It's hard to feel sorry even for poor Joe, because he's so without distinguishing features to his personality.  I've said this before about similar cases of first-person stories using a bland narrator--which always prompts other people to reach for the "Not Helpful" button--and that is that the story would have been more interesting either in first-person focusing on one of the parents or in third-person and focusing on both, so that we weren't so buffered from everything.  What makes Ford's Bascombe novels "The Sportswriter" and "Independence Day" so much better than his other novels is that we learn just about everything about Frank Bascombe and he is the center of all the action of the story, so that even if he is emotionally detached, it's easier to feel sympathetic towards him as a reader.  This can't be said for this dry little book.  If I hadn't bought this book for about as little as you can realistically pay without stealing it and if it were longer, then I would give it 1-star for wasting my time and money.  But I'll give it a bonus star for not wasting either one.  Now go reach for the Not Helpful button, I command you 
 I had hoped to use this book in my high-school history class but found that it does little in terms of imparting a solid sense of what life was like in ancient Rome.  The mystery portion is okay, but my real disappointment stems from the weakness of the historical contextualization 
  	Considering his string of career disappointments since the demise of "Lois & Clark" you have to wonder why in the world Dean Cain would ever have agreed to star in "Lost," a 2004 movie by Darren Lemke now available on DVD.  The only possible answer that comes to mind is that Cain figured that if people could suspend their disbelieve enough to not see through Clark Kent's disguise, then maybe they could also suspend it enough not see through this failed and pointless movie.  	The set-up here (one can't actually call it a plot) is that Cain is a bank VP who arranges to have his own bank robbed, and then double-crosses the bad guys who stage the hold-up on his behalf.  It is a premise that might have gone far in the hands of an accomplished screenwriter.  Unfortunately, Lemke acted as his own scribe and apparently never showed the script to a soul until the cameras started rolling, so one can only surmise that there was no one else there to tell him that he had gone way, way, way, off course.  	The tension in the film is supposed to come from three facts: #1, Cain's character, Jeremy Stanton, is lost somewhere in the Nevada desert trying to make his escape from what he initially believes to be the perfect crime.  The second alleged tension point is the fact that not only his erstwhile accomplices, but everyone else west of the Mississippi have quickly figured out that Stanton is the brains behind both the robbery and the double-cross.  The third and final bit of suspense is intended to come from the fact that Stanton's cheated former partners are hot on his trail.    Regrettably, not one of these subplots really works.  Much is made in the screenplay of the fact that Stanton's map is out of date and that roads along his intended route are closed, flooded or no longer in existence.  But by the third time his On-Star proxy telephone navigation aide has informed him that the road he is on actually has a different name than the one on the map, the device has worn dangerously thin.  In point of fact, it is probably impossible to truly get as lost anywhere in North America as Stanton is portrayed as being in the film. But this impossibility is only one of several that haunt this improbable tale.  A few other include Stanton's apparent belief that his disappearance will go unnoticed after the robbery; the fact that he is portrayed as not having ever scouted out his escape route, and therefore has no idea at all of where he is going; the fact that his bad guy accomplices somehow unerringly get from the scene of the crime to the exact same roads to nowhere he is unintentionally traveling, and do so quickly enough to literally be right on his tail; and the fact that these same accomplices not only figure out EXACTLY how to trap him, but are successful in doing so. The script even has Cain reprising one of his old Superman stunts, unbelievably successful in spite of the absence of costume or cape.  To spice up Stanton's journey, Director Lemke tosses in an ominous cop on trash patrol, a catatonic old lady with a truck to sell, a spooky toothless preacher, moral lessons from one of AAA's lesser known competitors, and perhaps the worst motivational speaker to ever sell an audio tape.  None of it helps.   This film is aptly titled, for the movie, like the Stanton character himself, speeds 90 miles an hour down a dead end road, and it is quite possible to sense Cain sharing Stanton's grudging relief when the whole thing comes to a predictable and bad end. "At least it's over," both the actor and his character must have been thinking.  It is only too bad that neither Cain nor his alter ego ever noticed the cavernous holes in this awful story; perhaps he could have driven through one, gotten clean away and against the odds lived happily ever after. 
 THE BEGINING WAS VERY AMUSING BUT AS IT GETS ON I JUST DON'T FEEL THE ROMANCE ANYMORE. THE SEX IS PRETTY MUCH CONSTANT BUT THE HEROINE'S CHARACTER WAS WAY TOO CHILDISH. SHE DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE UNTIL THE END OF THE BOOK. SHE'S NOT VERY EXCITING OR UNDERSTANDING LIKE THE OTHER FEMALE IN DARA JOY'S OTHER BOOK. THE GIRL JUST LEFT ME COLD AND SORRY FOR THE GUY. WELL, THE GUY IS VERY SWEET AND TRIED TO WOO HER FROM THE BEGINING TO THE END. AT FIRST IT WAS JUST A CHALLENGE TO HIM BUT THEN IT BECOMES A LOVE CHASE. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CUTE. ALTHOUGH HE'S A GREAT CHARACTER, THE ONGOING OF HIS MASCULINITY IS VERY ANNOYING IN THE HEROINE'S POINT OF VIEW. IT MAKES ME THINK SHE'S LUSTING AFTER HIM. BUT ANYWAY, I FIRST I ENJOYED THE BOOK BUT STILL IT LEFT ME UNCERTAIN OF THEIR FUTURE TOGETHER. IF IT WAS ANY OTHER HEROINE, THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE PULL IT OFF EASILY 
 Eugene O'Neill's play "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing.  
 After I had shot and unloaded a few hundred photos, it got so I couldn't shoot without getting either corrupted images or a refusal message from the camera. I contacted Kingston and they replaced the chip at no cost (including postage). Meanwhile I bought a 1 Gb SanDisk chip that has given no trouble, and so far I haven't tested the new 500 Mb Kingston chip 
 In the book Catherine stops a lot of guys from marrying her .She does that because she doesn't want to get married .Catherine likes to catch stuff on fire like guy who try to marry her. She also hides from her chores all the time because it makes her look like a good wife .She hates writing her journal. She also hates her father trying to marry her off 
 After completing my first year of law school, I really wonder why so many professors use this textbook.  More than half the people I spoke with in my class thought the casebook's usability was poor or worse.   Property is not a difficult class, aside from future estates and related issues (Rule Against Perpetuities).  The hardest thing about property is knowing the jurisdictional views on various aspects of property law, and this casebook does only an OK job highlighting that.  It is basically a lot of memorization and the learning of that material could have been substantially aided by organizing the book differently.  Additionally, many of its cases are not sufficiently edited, thereby necessitating that one read through too much irrelevant information to get to the legal issue.  My other case books are much more balanced on this issue.    As a last note, the production quality is lower than what I would expect for its price.  The paper chosen and the fair reproduction of what photos exist in the book contrast strongly with its price.    I suppose this sounds like a laundry list of complaints, but the book compares poorly to my other casebooks, simply stated 
 Sorry to say, but only the squares would find anything deep or revelatory in this movie, and that is a lot of you reading this, you poor, pasteurized processed cheese products of human beings. You people haven't already realised all the messages in this film by yourselves? Well, maybe something good will come of this film, for that.  This is basically an exploitation film done in A movie production style. In my opinion, the only merit this film has is that the pot-using boyfriend with the camera was not portrayed as an unintelligent lazy slacker. Everything else was completely laughable and ridiculous. The event that stands out in my mind is when the camera guy's military-dad is standing in his yard and watching as Kevin Spacey signals, in plain view, for camera guy to call him so they can meet for another financial transaction - Oh COME ON!  The fact that American Beauty (title of a Greatful Dead album) was so widely praised and acknowledged in the way that it was by so many people both terrifies me and gives me hope. Maybe you people are starting to catch up. llllllllllllllllllllll 
 Before reading this book, I had no idea what Phillip Pullman's personal positions on faith and religion were and that was pretty much what this book was about -- variations on the theme of "Phillip Pullman wrote this series as a rebuttal to C.S. Lewis and Christianity".  I picked this book up because I had so enjoyed Pullman books and had found the previous "Smart Pop" series books I had read so enlightening and mentally stimulating.  Unfortunately, this one did not reach that same level of interest.  I found the majority of the essays to be rather simplistic and very little of what I read made me think.  It was illuminating to hear the underlying philosophy that Pullman brought to his writing, but I would have liked it if they essayists had not all addressed this same topic but had instead looked at other aspects of the book 
 this book was not well thought out. it was just an attempt to sound intelligent, but failed. the purpose of a book the should be to enlighten your readers not with big sounding words but with good ones that best describe the situation you are trying to get across. to me the book had nothing to do with tupac, it dealt with the author's lack of ability to put words together to form a sentence that could capture his audience. he just used the icon's name to sell his book, and true we fell for it, the true fans of tupac. we try so hard to grasp hold on anything and anyone that can give us more facts than we already have, so it pains me when people do things like this book which was so so so poorly written. i would hate to have a face to face conversation with him. PAC will always be in our hearts, thoughts and thanks to the real Gs he will be on our radios, TVs, VCRs & DVDs. as PAC would say, "NEVER IGNORANT GETTING GOALS ACCOMPLISHED. 
 Why does Franken have to continually "borrow" names from those who are politically opposed to get himself some attention? Without the constant use and abuse of names like "Limbaugh" and "O'Reilly" (with radio and tv ratings to prove their success)in his titles - would ANYONE take a second look? I have to wonder.... 
 As far as crime dramas go, this is firmly mediocre.  The story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically, but the author's writing style is sometimes a distraction.  Why do the African-American suspects always ask for Slice soda to drink?  And they repeatedly make a point of asking for Slice.  (Do they even make it anymore?  I thought it was replaced by Sierra Mist).   And another distracting detail is the author's way of giving so many people nicknames.  You don't need to tell me that a guy's name is Ed "Smiley" Jones if you never mention "Smiley" again or there's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname.  That said, I liked the use of DC as the backdrop and if I was going on a plane ride, I would probably pick up another book by Pelecanos (but I wouldn't let anyone see what I was reading and then I'd leave it in the seatback when I deplaned) 
 of some of the authors earlier books on atlantis plus some obligatory material on rennes-le-chateau. if you have read  "From Atlantis To The Sphinx" and or "The Atlantis Blueprint" and "The Da Vinci Code" you are already familiar with 95% of the book. there is the equilivent of a short magazine article at the very end of the book where he finally mentions the neanderthals that has some new material. but overall a very disappointing book 
 I've had this for 18 mos.  Something came loose in the body and it is now rather noisy.  Also, there are times when I have to turn the unit off, then on, to get the heating element to engage.  I'm keeping this one, but wouldn't buy it again 
 I found the graphics in this book to be poorly chosen and of poor quality, which was surprising, given the book's title and topic. The layout was less than gripping, again surprising, given the book's title and topic. Given these two critical flaws,one would be hesitant to follow the authors' advice for graphics and layout! Roger C. Parker's Desktop Publishing for Dummies and Ann Goodheart's Alleviating Prepress Anxiety cover more territory, better, more amusingly, more swiftly -- and they cost much less 
 While I love Dennis Lehane, his prose his timing and generally his stories; these stories get more and more depressing as you move along.  
 This book got great reviews and was recommended to me by someone whose taste I trust, but I've got to say, I just don't understand its appeal.  It starts out as mildly intriguing, and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative, but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear, and the narrator of the middle section, salt-of-the-earth gardener Son, is not only too good to be true, he's also deathly boring--a dull-witted drone.  I've read Bel Canto and The Patron Saint of Liars only confirms my belief that Ann Patchett's novels are overrated.  
 Hollywood Wives is about a screenwriter, director, producer, aging movie star, and struggling actor struggling to make a movie. The lives of the actors' wives are tediously depicted. There is also a random, out of place subplot about a crazed murderer. The haphazard plot is the least of this book's problems. Many of the characters are so sketchily and superfically depicted that it is difficult to discern one character from another. Collins must have been ensconced in her Beverly Hills mansion for the past fifty years, for she has no ear for dialogue. The hardened teenage prostitute speaks like a migrant farmer from The Grapes of Wrath: "Hey, you lookin' for some fun, buster?"; "These two black cats riped me off, but I got away from 'em." Then there's the French born Bibi,who talks not with a French accent, but like a four year old: "How you together? Last night he together with Gina. I sorry darling, you make a mistake." The sex scenes are revolting, and the sentences are written without 10th grade proficiency. Worst of all is the depiction of nearly every gay character as a pervert or murderer.  Combine this with a preposterous ending and you have one big loser of a book. If you're looking for a fun beach book, you can do better than this 
 Lord, what did the Publisher do?  Type the poems on 3x5 cards, shuffle  them and present the totally random result?  The poems follow no order at  all.  Early is mixed with late; India with the sea with World War I.  The  book cries out for an editor, an annotator, anyone!  The publisher should  be ashamed 
 I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.   Concerned in Alabam 
 I could not really enjoy the film. I purchased it recently on VHS and the audio quality was horrendous. I don't think anything was ever done to remaster the audio, and it is very annoying to follow. Don't waste $19.95 on it. Watch it on TCM; even there the audio is distorted. I only got it because it is a very early Irene Dunne movie, and I was curious to watch it 
 I was at the airport, getting ready to fly out to Cali and I found this book in the airport gift shop- I thought what a stroke of luck I had getting a Stephen King title at such a juncture... I'm a huge  fan. Despite the fact that I started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed, I was sorely disappointed.  Much ado about nothing would be an overstatement 
 This is the worst technical writing I have ever seen. Harrington tells you what to do but doesn't tell you how to do it. That is useless. You wouldn't need the book if you knew how to to it. A lot of the directions just plain don't work. It is very frustrating. I'm surprised it is an Apple Training Series because some of the others are fantastic. 
 Sat down and saw this one on televion.  Only good service was that now I know buying the DVD would be a waste of money.  What was actually achieved by the British is portrayed as an American achievement. Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats.   The movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and  unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional.   This film Awful. 
 This book is fatally flawed.  Layard's notion that you can create happiness by removing risk from society is absurd.  Risk and challenge are what keep us alive.  Without it, we become nothing more than drones.  Instead of spending the time on this book, readers would do well to read Ayn Rand's account in her first novel, "We the Living," of what happens when people try to do just what Layard proposes in his book. "We the Living" is Rand's profound personal account of the swift and complete demise of her country and its people through the acceptance of the collectivist philosophies that Layard pushes in his book.  Living in Soviet Russia just after the 1917 Revolution, Rand lived with all the socialism that "Happiness:  Lessons from a new Science" claims is the only way, and grew to hate it all with such distate that she spent the rest of her life trying to abolish it. Her book alone is reason enough not to read this one 
 If you want to know what this guy thinks his dogs are thinking, buy this book 
 This was my first book for PERL and let me tell you, it was the worst written piece of garbage I have ever read. This book lives up to its name - it makes you feel like a dumbass.  This is due to the authors approach in showing you PERL.  Rather than breaking down the structure and powerful commands (telling you what they are and what they can do), he instead takes the approach of just showing you countless examples of complex code that the reader hasn't been properly introduced to.  To show an example of how to use the chomp command, he buries it within examples along with other commands that he hasn't even talked about. That is confusing for a beginner. If you knew how to read his code, you wouldn't need this book in the first place.   I recommend going with O'Reilly books instead. They tend to take a systematic approach, discussing and breaking down the structure and use of specific commands and then showing you small examples using only the code and commands they already discussed. Believe me, it is better than dummies approach of making you try to read a 50 line code example to see what a specific command can do.    Stay away from the dumies series.  All these books do is make you feel like a dummy. 
 My copy of "Reckless Nights..." (and yours, too, probably) has a sticker on front that reads: "One of the Most Influential Musicians of the 20th Century."  Well, I'm so glad that Columbia cleared that up.  Otherwise, I'd have had to make up my OWN mind, and apparently music labels don't allow that nowadays.  I hope similar stickers are included on Chopin, Mozart, and Bach CDs (with the century adjusted on a per-composer basis).  Scott's gimmicky fare makes for pleasant listening, but not in such a large dose--monotony sets in after two or three titles, let alone 22. Halfway through this CD, I felt as if I were listening to the drone of a defrosting icebox.  For all the outrageous hyperbole thrown at Scott--no one else like him, no way to categorize his music, and so on, and so on--the reality is that composers and arrangers like Ferde Grofe, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Alec Templeton, and Bill Challis covered the same ground far more skillfully--and, in most instances, earlier--than Scott.  Concert jazz, symphonic jazz, or whatever you wish to call it, was NOT the invention of any one man, and certainly not Scott.  Check out Grofe's scores for Whiteman--in particular, his writing for woodwinds and his constant, Scott-esque use of muted trumpet.  Listen to Duke Ellington's "extended" compositions circa 1929.  For that matter, listen to Ellington's 1933 "Daybreak Express"--virtually the template for Scott's galloping miniatures.  Experience Bill Challis and Glenn Miller's pioneering big band charts.  Or... believe as you're told to believe, i.e. that Scott, and Scott alone, performed this kind of music.  I mean, who needs history when we've got hype?  It's up to YOU, dear listener 
 I do like this t-shirt.  I liked the organic cotton and the general style.  But I will never buy American Apparel again.  Not only are they VERY labor and union unfriendly, their ads exploitive of young girls (I mean, I can tolerate some of the young models in general, but these are particularly young girls in amature porn-looking situations), but a friend's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores.    I know I can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere.  ick 
 I found this book to be extremely boring.  While the pictures were done well, the content was way too traditional and museum-like.  The rooms didn't look like anyone could live in them, and that the furniture ought to  be slipcovered in plastic like some of our Grandparents homes 
 THIS BOOK WAS PRE-ORDERED AND HAS NOT YET BEEN PUBLISHED, TO MY KNOWLEDGE.  YOU NEED TO CHECK YOUR COMPUTER 
 I was so dissapointed by this book! I read the first two and thought while they were not up to Julia London's previous books, they were light airplane reads. After 50 pages of Rachel not doing anything but letting her friends use her and eat, I was bored, bored, bored.  I only skimmed throught to see her parents moving forward.   I do not recommend this book at all 
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 The Scientific Method applied to this book:  1) Form a hypothesis:  Great managers do something differently than mediocre managers. 2) Conduct an experiment:  Interview 80,000 managers. 3) Analyze data: ???this step is missing??? 4) Draw conclusions: Write this Book.  With the exception of the "12 questions", the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study.  They make several insightful statements, such as "many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes."  However, they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement.  Did 90% of the managers interviewed state this?  Did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?  Does "many managers" mean 100 managers?  100 managers seems like "many managers" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed I 100 managers is a negligible amount.  The entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study.    It seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost no common trends.  However, since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show for it and wrote this book.  If Buckingham and Coffman didn't claim this book was a result of "the largest study of its kind," I would say it offers some decent advice;  however, since it does make this claim, I wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.   
 The other reviewers will tell you about the book.  I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.  So this is just a warning.  If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books.  
 First of all, this is NOT the worst movie ever made, nor even the worst movie ever made that was given a budget and some name stars. The worst movie ever made was "Autumn in New York", but that is a different review.   No, this not a great movie, but it is very interesting. And for once, thank God, it doesn't end with everything tied up in a pretty Hollywood bow where everthing works out for everyone. It has a gritty sort of realism that transcends the walk through performances of the stars of the movie. And the scenery works well for the overall feel of the movie, bleak.  More interestingly for me and others of my generation who grew up with the brat pack, this marked the end of these actors forays into trying to do the teenager thing. For Molly Ringwald, she didn't do anything of note again until "The Stand" six years later, and for Andrew McCarthy, well it could be argued that he still hasn't starred in anything of note again (although he probably made some money from "Weekend at Bernies" I & II).  Anyway, probably better to rent than buy, I am only buying it to complete my 80's collection.    
 This textbook is more useful for the flashy (and admittedly very good) teacher's ancillaries. But this review is not for the ancillaries. It is for the text itself.  The text's treatment of proofs is very cursory and not rigorous enough. The diagrams for the algebraic problems are too confusing, compiling numerous different concepts into one problem. While I agree that students must learn to differentiate one property/theorem/rule/postulate from another, it doesn't make sense that most, instead of some, diagrams are over-complicated. Personally, I don't like the format with the examples, mainly because it downplays the necessity for students to become LITERATE in math, not just a good "example comparer." The text has little actual TEXT to speak of.  I have not been teaching HS for very long, but I do not like this book. I am not a textbook dependent teacher, but I do (woefully) recognize that students have poor study skills and don't reference notes all the time. I do not teach out of the textbook and I spend many hours planning lessons, lecture notes, my own examples, etc. I had many complaints that the problems were confusing, included too many ideas at the same time, etc. Some may be successful in "teaching themselves" from the examples, but I am very disappointed that textbooks no longer have TEXT. I may be a math teacher, but I understand the importance of reading and how it helps a person to process the material.   On the other hand, the teacher resources is a great set of worksheets, study masters, note taking guides, etc. Perhaps the authors spent more time on those resources instead of the text. 
 This multimedia presentation was nice.  The images where amazing, I would give it a five but, I felt lost.  I didn't know anything about the artist or what neo-symbolist photography was.  I was hoping that there would was background history on the photographer and why he chose to do this. I also wanted maybe a little information of what neo-symbolist photography is.  So if you know who Snterineross is and what neo-symbolist photography is i highly recommend it.  but if you don't, stay away, until you do 
 I'm very disappointed by the lack of content in this book. After breezing through it in one night I felt like there was so much more that can be covered. Most of the book were pictures the author has taken for portfolios he's build. The quality of pictures are ok at best. It would have been more useful if he used portraits from photographers to contrast to his own style. The reader had to take the authors word on what looks right and wrong. 1 or 2 more view points would have made a huge difference.   Specific information on important aspect of shooting the shots were also left out. The author should have gave more insight on picking locations, using the right lighting, instructing the models, and how to conceptualize the pictures. If the focus of this book was not on the technicalities of portfolio photography but rather on working with models there is still be a huge gap in information. More insight and techniques for instructing the model during the shoot or details on the financial aspect of this type of photography would have been very useful.  Reading through the book, I feel like the author thew it together based on  a few notes and added pictures from his own portfolio. As it stands, most the book can be summarized in only 10-15 pages. The content fails only to pierce the most basic of details on portfolio shooting. I would recommend readers to seek out other literature on the subject as this entire book would only cover what would be a chapter in most comprehensive books on model photography 
 This item is marginally functional at best. It does work if you are in the middle of nowhere, but if you are in a big city and cannot find an FM signal that is free it can be very fuzzy and unbearable. Another Minus to this product is it is very unstable when you plug it it. It will want to fall over and not bend the way you want it. I would not buy this product again and seriously consider an ipod next time because of its superior accessories. 
 This guy's box is missing a few tools.Most of the stuff he quotes as fact is not supported in real life. He's full of crap. Everybody knows walking is good for you, but kevin T. starts his chapter on walking by saying that 'when you take your dog for a walk, he (or she) poops............well la-de-f_____ing-da....isn't that WHY you take your dog for a walk....because you don't want him (or her) to poop in the house. Then there's his statement that if you put your teflon pan on high heat and have a parakeet on your shoulder, the bird will keel over dead because of the poisonous gasses.......and another thing, who ever heard of an acidic body???  I think I know what planet Trudeau came from....URANU 
 In a word: BORING!  This book would have been twice as good were it half as long. Selbourne has cut the end and would have done well to cut the middle as well. Jacob's incessant protestations of piety are tedious. He hypocritically condemns everyone around him for greed and self-interest but his own actions, though ostensibly high-minded, are also dictated almost solely by financial motives. For this reason his criticism of others rings hollow. His world view is remarkably narrow and parochial for someone so widely traveled. While he makes extensive observations of the conduct of others, there is no effort to appreciate their viewpoints. I am also skeptical of the provenance of this book. The social debates described have a very contemporary tenor and are relevant to our own times. If this were in fact an authenticated manuscript, this resonance would be remarkable. However, the provenance of the book is in dispute and much space is devoted to supporting its authenticity. The resolution of this issue must await examination of the original manuscript but in the meantime I am skeptical because the discussions seem too modern 
 Andrew Weill is perhaps the most well-known of these type of practioners.  Unfortunately, some of what he has to say has been clinical disproven. For example, in study after study, large amnounts of Vitamin C given orally do absolutely nothing more than a   placebo for cancer patient.  Yet he still preaches this.  Given intravenously, actually, there is some evidence that it may work for some people..but it does not work by stimulating your immune system..it works in a different way.  The book How To treat and Prevent Cancer with Natural Medicine is far superios in my opinion, even though it was written by four naturopaths in 2002.  Even then they admitted that clinical studies were showing that there was no advantage of taking Vitamin C orally over a placebo,  and the authors freely admitted it. But much of what the discussed in that book..Eight Magic supplements to take when you have cancer..has actually been proven. I am a cancer patient with myeloma.  Maitake D fraction, curcumin (it must be taken w/bioperine an hour before meals), selenium, and some other things they mention have all been proven in clinical studies or are being worked on.  They do not promise that they have a cure of anything..they only say it may help in the context of complimentary medicine. They do not claim an organic diet will cure cancer or that medical science would hide it if they have a cure.  The book by Quiallan I think claims that an organic diet will cure you, and there is post after post that this has actually worked.  Maybe it has..but as a myeloma patient..my immune system is overstimulated, so I cannot take most immune system supplements..and some like Vitamin C are actually antagonistic In Vitro to myeloma treatments..this usually translates to the same thing in the body..unlike positive in studies that often do not pan out.  Anyway, I am not saying Dr. Weill is all wrong, but do not pretend he has a cure.  I have known secondhand two people who have been cured by long fasts of only carrot juice, another two by healers (I  am not religious), and one who claims that barley juice and lowering his PH totally got rid of his cancer.  I believe these people all may have gotten rid of their LOCALIZED tumors this way. For blood cancers, such as leukemia and myeloma (a cancer of blood produced in the marrow), we do not exactly have localized tumors.  But with the addition of supplements mentioned in Dr. Murray et al's book, my response to medications has been phenomenal and I have went into remission. Unfortunately, at this time, myeloma always comes back from remission. There is new understanding why this may be so..that just came out December 2005.  There is even a drug available..but it will not be available to myeloma patients for a long while 
 I was brought up evangelistic Christian, I was forced every sunday to go into church where "SOME" were turned away.At a very young age I saw such unjust intolerence for other people and thier belief systems, example:All who are not "BORN AGAIN" will go to hell.Unfortunately it was that attitude that was so common within the church, and not the actual teachings and love for christ that turned me away.I do not descriminate about the teachings of Christ only of the fact that MANY BUT NOT ALL Christians believe all who are not Christian will not be welcomed by god.  I simply cannot and then could not understand why only christians who belonged to the same series of churches could go to heaven and all others were going to burn in hell.As a very young person  I made up my mind that I could not be apart of an organization with such prejudice and overwhelming and sickening  ,self righeouness.I however never abandoned my faith in jesus christs love  but decided to learn more about these other religions that in the evangelistic church I was told were "EVIL" and wrong.  Upon my research I found that most religions are based on a higher being often called upon different names only because of difference in location and language, in wicca there is a god and goddess however they are only represenatives as different sides of a whole.In every aspect of life there is a male force and a female force one cannot exist without the other and neither can life.Wiccans believe that the Divine spirit is within everything and all so revere nature, and show a great respect to all creatures, rocks , plants , animals , and of course human beings.They simply show the Great spirit or god respect by acknoledging the creation and recreation of all life.  I do not believe that any one religion is wrong or right I believe that religion is man made and therefore  imperfect, but I know that one should research the "dark" and "light" side of everything before  being capable of coming to a real educated decision.I would also like to point out that whatever is right for one person may not be for another and vise versa, and so it is with ones spirituality.  Now about this book, I read this as I have with many books related to neopagan religions.All I got from it was a great reminder of why I an no longer affiliated with the Evangelists Christian church.It was quite apparent to me that this book was not researched, because I have done my own research.This book was very Biased, and many things that were taken from other books and used as examples were twisted around to reveal something negative when much about Wicca is about living life positively.  Please if you do decide to read this book to gain knoledge on Wicca dont forget to do further reading on the subject before you make up your mind(it is only fair),And remember not all Wiccans use Witchcraft and vice versa.Also try to remember that everything we see on telivision is not accurate or truthful.Wiccans and witches are not learking behind trees in dark cloaks waiting for some poor Christian to put curses upon , and People who claim they are Wiccan or Witch and commit terrible crimes and murders are just psychopaths and nothing more just as the claimed to be Christian cult in Wacco Texas 15 years ago.  I would also like to say something to the teens who are interested in Wicca, If you are searching for a way to get whatever you want without hard work and dedication Wicca is not for you, If you want to harm others because of injustices done to you, Wicca is not for you, If you want to gain attention by wearing all black and listening to death metal,That is not Wicca that is Called "goth Style", and it does not validate any religion it is just a personal clothing choice, and makeup choice, ones religion or lifestyle GOTHIC or otherwise does not REQUIRE one to look any certain way. in my opinion One does not need to alter thier appearance to "BE WHO I AM", in my opinion that is exactly the opposite of being who you are, use your personality,open communication and, intelligence to throw out a better signal of who you are.Of couse feel free to have fun with the way you look if you so choose.  And for Christians, One cannot ever be fully knoledgeable about anything.A few hundred years ago we knew the world was flat,In order to become wise one never stops learning, and thus does not stop with learning about the spirituality your family forced upon you at birth.It continues with the unbiased research of other religions, do not only read about other religions through the authors of Christian writers , that would be stupid.Would you learn anything about politics in a cookbook?If of course you do not want to delve into another belief system , and actually learn what it is about then please do not descriminate against the people whom follow another belief system.That would be like a child insisting that he/she does not like yams without actually tasting them first.  Edited to limit any confusion my first statement about goth may have inflicted upon some 
 This book has very good chapters regarding the origins of the margarita and about the different types of tequila. But, as far as margarita recipes... well... it's the same recipe over and over substituting different brands of tequila and orange liqueur. The proportions of tequila to liqueur to lemon (or lime) juice are itentical for each "recipe."  But, I must give some credit to the author... he does clearly state on page 30: "Although the mixing procedure is essentially the same for each margarita, the tequila and orange liqueur--or combination of the two--change from recipe to recipe." But, with that said, the whole book could have been reduced to a one-page chart with all of the tequilas listed on the page with "best mixed with" liqueur type listed next to it. Instead, we are treated to a whole book with identical "recipes" where the quantities remain the same, only the tequila brand names and liqueur brand names change.  Regarding the different types of tequila, the author likes to use the example of maple syrup. You have different grades of syrup that all taste different, then there's the syrups that are mixed with corn syrup. True, this is a good analogy for how different tequilas are made (100% agave vs. mixtos), but I think this analogy best fits the recipes in this book! For example, this book is similar to that of a pancake book that lists the same pancake recipe over and over, only the reader is instructed to use a different type of maple syrup for each "recipe." Yup, that's how this book reads!  I have a very good margarita recipe at home, it calls for the use of tequila, sweet & sour mix, Grand Marnier, Cointreau, and fresh orange juice. It makes an excellent margarita! But, there's nothing like it in this book... just the same basic recipe over-and-over-and-over again.  There are other books that are better at explaining how tequila is made and the differences between the brands... I would recommend buying those books to learn about tequila. Once you have a solid underatanding of tequila, then search the Internet and try various recipes. 
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
 I have ordered this item since Aug, now is Nov, but i still havent received it 
 I am in my last year of school and preparing to embark on a career in banking. Out of all the finance and economics (I'm a double major) textbooks I have used this is the absolute worst bar none. While the text has a very large amount of information that same information is simply thrown at you with no real presentation.  One other thing that bothers me (possible the most) is the fact that I get severe headaches when I read this text. I have never read a book before with text this small. To me this says something since I am a voracious reader and frequently am reading 3-4 novels while also studying for my classes 
 I have not received the books I ordered 3/01/2007, can you please check the address is 11357 SW 68 Ter, Miami, Fl  3317 
 I really wanted to like this book, but confess I stopped reading halfway through.  First of all, it reads like a well written executive briefing, done by someone charged with researching a topic about which he knew very little.  Unfortunately, this author really does not seem to know much about World War II.  For example, he keeps referring to soldiers as "Doughboys" and "Doughs."  The correct vernacular term for WW II soldiers was "G.I.'s" or just "soldiers."  "Doughboy" is a World War One term, but this author seemed to like it, so he tried to write it into the history of the Second World War.     Second, the author marvels at the fact that General Leslie McNair's tanks fought as Independent Tank battalions, but he clearly does not know why this occurred.  And, he correctly mentions how the independent tankers and soldiers eventually came to the conclusion that working in concert (just like armored divisions) worked best.  This should have come from the command structure, but with McNair's units the learning curve came from the bottom up.    The author neglects to mention (perhaps because he doesn't know) that General McNair was vehemently anti-armor.  In fact, McNair was so politically well-connected in the Army that he attempted to quash the use of armor (in favor of the "tank destroyer"), and almost succeeded in doing so.  Lucky for the U.S. that Colonel George Patton made McNair look bad in war games during the late 30's, and proved that armored divisions could work.  Patton did this by running roughshod over McNair's divisions using his concept of armor and infantry fighting in concert.      There was some good information in this book, but the author never really pulled it together.  He seemed to see a lot of trees without realizing that he was in a forest.  The context was not really there 
 This was a ridiculous documentary. I watched with an open mind, and after it was finished I was so irritated because he showed such a one sided biased view, it was ridiculous. Being that it is a Michael Moore movie I should have expected this but I tried to view it openly. Let me warn you now, don't waste 2 hours or 20 dollars 
 I am such a big fan of the Barenaked Ladies and of Steven Paige, that I hate to give "Vanity Project" a bad review.  Alas, I would be lying if I said that I liked it.  I felt as though all of the songs were very similar.  The album lacks the diversity that almost all of the Barenaked Ladies albums have.  Almost all of the songs use the same instruments in the same manner; song after song after song.  I like "wilted rose" but not enough to make up for the rest of the songs.  Sorry to disappoint anyone that really likes this album.  I think I subconsiously bought it because I wanted to hear Barenaked Ladies music... that was my own mistake.  Overall, I have to say that the album is mediocre at best 
 Despite not being written on the packaging or website my HP iPaq RX3417 was compatible with this keyboard.  Unfortunatly the software supplied was extremely bad, clogging my PDA making it run very slowely. As well as this, it also flickered when in use making the settings for the keyboard very difficult to change.  In terms of hardware, I found the size and position of keys to be the biggest problem. While targus does include all 5 rows of a standard keyboard, it shrinks the top row (numbers) and the bottom row (space bar). This makes it very difficult to use the space bar (which is for some reason split into three parts) and the numbers (which could have been made full size as there is nothing else in the way). I found myself constantly not hitting the right key or not hitting the right key hard enough for the key to register. In terms of key position, there is a gap between the keys on the left side and right side of the keyboard making hitting the keys in the middle very difficult. Some keys are also very small (e.g. the right shift key and backspace) making them difficult to use (strange considering they are used a lot on keyboards).  One of the biggest problems I had with the keyboard was the lack of proper arrow keys. Targus includes an oval shaped four direction button that controls a mouse cursor that appears on the screen. This mouse cursor is useful, but needs to be supplemented with normal Up, Down, Left and Right keys which are needed when typing to go back to another part of the document. Using the mouse to do this is very frustrating.  The final negative thing about this keyboard was the price. I paid AUD$149.95 for this keyboard. Doing some research on the internet found better models (i.e. Think Outside Stowaway IR Keyboard) available for less than half the price (around AUD$70) and bluetooth keyboards available for less than AUD$190. I think it might be about time Targus releases a new model PDA keyboard with a design and software that are suitable for the use the keyboard will get. No more tiny keys and no more than two space bars 
 Had 3 leaks all in the seams! Could not patch correctly even after waiting the "30 mins." to re-infalte like the directions stated. My son was extremely upset. From other reviews, it sounds like there is a 50/50 chance of getting a good product 
 Disclaimer:  I only read selections from this book!  I was interested in looking through this book because 1.) people have told me it is good and 2.) I thought Blue like Jazz was terrible and cannot understand why people like his writting so much.   With that in mind I purused a copy of my friends and not surprisingly found it just as underwhelming.    The writing is getting better.  The "insights" into life, while highly personal and occationally compelling, are shallow and obvious.  It is like being at a Sunday sermon where the pastor preaches a moving speach, but upon reflection you realize it was just another homily.  Spend the time you would be reading this book doing something much more constructive - like reading and reflecting on the bible itself 
 This seat is a great concept, it just doesn't stay together very well.  I took it back to the store and they marked it as "defective".  For a few dollars more, I got the "Healthy Care Booster Seat" from Fisher Price.  I've had much better luck with it 
 We received this product in a clear plastic molded container, however there were no instructions at all, nor was there any label.  We immediately thought, this must not be a new product.  Not knowing exactly how to attach it to the PSP or detach it, one of the clips has broken.  We also have more questions - can the battery inside this charger be replaced? If so, what kind is it?  I think we'll be returning this product 
 After reading this book I have to wonder if the author is really 52!!  He writes like he is in 5th grade.  This is a book that should entice people into the lifestyle, instead it repeals them!  This book is made up of fantasies that only makes the author appear like a stud, when in reality he is the opposite.  If interested in finding out about what life in the swinging world is about try another book that will give you real facts not fiction and fantasy of one man's deluded desires 
 The author begins telling us why he wrote it and asking why we should read it. Good question, and the answer is that we shouldn't, and he shouldn't have either.  Oh sure, Jim Baggott has got his equations down pat, but alas, from the opening page he gets hopelessly lost in matters he clearly doesn't understand. Get a clue, Jim;  Schrodinger's Cat was a REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, a "jumping out of the box" so to speak, showing that the word "consciousness" does not belong in a discussion of quantum theory, unless perhaps in a chapter on the the early history of this subject when everyon was confused.  Even Von Neumann went out on some pretty wild limbs when this whole flap started, though he certainly came off of them before his famous axiomatization of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, in case you missed his sequels, he would later advance the concept of "strong" artificial intelligence, which minimally agrees with modern cognitive science that consciousness is a high order function in which the quantum scale of things appears to be utterly irrelevant (and visa versa.)  How about this for a metaphor? This book is much like an otherwise excellent "biology in a nutshell" chapbook, but one which also has a few sprinklings and maybe a chapter or two on scientific creationism and intelligent design, delusions which clearly have no place in modern science.  Such is it with "quantum quackery," the notion that uncertainty gives us carte blanche to impose our metaphysical fantasies on the univerese.  Intermixed with genuine erudition, to be sure, this book provides a basic groundwork for all the pseudoscience and mysticism that are the current rage in new age circles.  Sadly, the author has done such a fine job with those components of quantum theory thathe actually does understand, that this seems to legitimize the rubbish with which he has filled his knowledge gaps.  In short, this book flirts with the notion of being intellectually dangerous.  I'm apalled that Oxford would publish such drivel.  Whatever happened to peer review 
 Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible however he does bring up some good points. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book entiteled "The Great Divorce" 
 This book shows how "traditional conservatives" are just plain dumb. (and apparently all the other reviewers of this book) Here you have a philosopher who at is core is a moral relavist. The classic conservative believes in absolutes, mostly biblical. Yet it is clear that neoconservatives are running the bush administration right now, and most sheepish conservatives do not even realize they are supporting people that are diametrically oppossed to them. What makes neocons dangerous is they are so motivated to be wrong. It is like revenge of the evil nerds. It's the battered wife syndrome. Jews get bullied so long they want to become the bullies. But at least be original, don't just copy nazi germany. Too bad there are not a cult of readers of the book "lila" by Pirsig that shows that there is a morality. Thank god for karma, and the fact that we all die eventually   God help this country. 
 Though I've heard good things from this drive and SEAGATE is a prestigous brand which is why I mark it 2 stars eventhough I couldn't never use it.  This drive requires a FireWire port. Although it has another USB 2.0 port, it most likely not gonna work or going to die fast. So if your computer doesn't have a FireWire port, there's a high chance you gonna have to return it.  Another thing is external drive is extremely vulnerable to bad handling so I don't know if buying it online is a good thing to do 
 I suppose it's my own fault, but I too am disappointed to find that this item is not as versatile as I had thought.  It's not to be used on the range - microwave or oven (oven for tea?) only.  I researched the product on Le Creuset's site first, but didn't pick up on the fact that their statement concerning suitability for use on stovetops was for their cast iron products, not stoneware.  Again, my own fault, but it would have been helpful to have this info. stated explicitly in the product description section.  And how happy am I that I paid extra $$ to have it expedited?  *groan*  That aside, it is a very attractive red, looks good on the table, and does not get too hot to handle out of the microwave 
 I have not read this edition of Dr. Kent's book, but as a former student of Dr. Kent's, I was forced to buy his text when I took his comparative anatomy course.  At the time, I found it a difficult read of marginal  usefulness.  When he left Louisiana State, a different, far better text was  introduced.  If this is merely an update of that volume, I echo others who  recommend other sources 
 It claims to be "the saddest story I have ever heard". Well, it is certainly not the saddest story I have ever read. Usually, sad things happen to good, thinking people. It is beyond my understanding how this tepid book can have so good a reputation. No doubt, adultery and the passions that surround it can be a great subject to write a novel, but the problem here is that characters are at the same time plain and unsympathetic. The trick, in my opinion, is that they pass for profound people, when in fact they are void, useless and jobless persons. The florid language in which the book is written gives the impression of psychological depth, but the truth is these characters have not much to search for within their personalities. Edward Dowell, the narrator, is the typical cuckold, unaware that his hypocritical wife is sleeping with another man -his friend, to make it worse- under his nose. Fool. Florence Dowell is a typical hypocrite (funny, they all seemed to me to be the "typical" something, which may tell you how profound I found them), an emotional blackmailer. Her husband gives his life to her, devotes himself to take care of her illness, and she goes and sleeps with a friend. And she's not even sexy or wicked or nymphomaniac. She's just an unfaithful common woman. Pig. Leonora Ashburnham is at the same time proud, detestable, arrogant and fool. She devotes her life to mend the fences broken by her irresponsible, philandering husband, who spends all his money on other women and gambling. Leonora is always there for him. Dumb. And John, well, John Ashburnham... Lucky guy. Rich, seductive, idle, always generous to easy women, always losing money and depending on his wife to talk to creditors. Always with nothing to do but seduce other women, including friends' wives. Pathetic loser.  The funny thing is, everybody knows what's going on but no one does anything about it, and later they all complain and are perplexed. Boring and despicable lives make, in this case, for a bad novel, representative of the worst traits of XX century literature. The ending is exhilarating by way of trying to be tragic and moving 
 That is what this book should have been called. Reading it is like a very slow walk to nowhere 
 I was guided to read a few books about Mary Magdalene these past few months.   The relatively short story Joan Norton shared with us in her book was an added confirmation of the special bond between two historical figures whose lives were distorted by too human narrow views. This is a touching, intensely personal account of the power of their love 
 I give it one star for the dvd. I give the movie 5 stars or more if I could. Starting out is, everyone who is a die hard fan of this movie knows this is suppose to be a widescreen motion picture. hell even on TNT high definition tv, they aired it in the right aspect so I had to tape it because ive never got to see it in its actual aspect. Second of all the box art gives the whole movie away. being reason I say this is because of the poster art of the movie and the old warner vhs tape shows no sign of what kind of creature is cujo. I know it might not be a big deal to some people but when I first rented this movie, I was so curious about what CUJO was, The box art and original theatrical poster art was so unique that you were guessing what kind of horror is this. Well I know people are going to say, READ THE BOOK DUMMY and you will know. Well I am not a book reader but I was so excited to know what kind of killer was CUJO and was a dog, I kinda had a hunch though. This movie is fantastic. One of those kinds that you could just sit there and feel that everything on the show was really actually happening and not just acting. That is a good movie! One last thing. Dont go buying this peice of junk dvd. wait until warner releases the true format and maybe some extra features to go along. THey did it with the classic. Lost boy 
 When used as a self-study text, I found the book to be lacking a sufficient quantity of example problems solved in adequate detail to be truly helpful 
 I like many others have had major issues with this crock pot burning everything I make. I lent it to my sister in law for Christmas, ahe has another brand pot at home and hers did not burn at all, or boil. Mine had the same food in it and was boiling and burned the dish. Even on low it boils and burns. I will be contacting Rival now that Iknow that I am not the only one....  I would not recommend this brand or unit.. 
 I purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a USB charging cradle that would not work.  This is terrible, terrible quality control and I will never trust another casio product. 
 I had hoped this would be a great one as we are big fans of the rat pack and Bing Crosby....but the quality was sub-par.  I know the label says it is done that way on purpose...but I cannot even imagine it looking that bad on tv back when it was originally aired...it looks more like someone backed a tank over it again and again.  Really too bad considering the show was a good one.  The sound quality is much better than the picture and the 3 stars are quite humorous and entertaining.  Hopefully any future episodes would be remastered in much better fashion! 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope 
 It worked fine for 2 -3  weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my SHORT hair and it would just stop.  I had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again.  Gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together.  Very frustrating.  Go get a professional dryer.  it might cost a bit more but it'll work!  And probably for a long time 
 This is probably the most incoplete, inarticulate book I've ever used so far in my 3 years in college. It fails to COMPLETELY explain ALL THE MANY concepts you will ,sort-of ummmm, need to pass the class,tests or even complete the problems within the book. Expect to buy at least one other pre-calc text to clearly explain EVERYTHING this book consistently DOESN'T. This book is not a student-friendly one, its more of an EXPERT MATHEMETICIAN-FRIENDLY text book, written for people who already have lots of experience with pre-calculous. First time precalculous students should not actually expect to learn from this book or be able to count on this book as a reliable source to turn to during homework assignments or study sessions... As this book consistently fails to articulate even the most simple of precalculous concepts. If you don't beleive mine along with most other negative ratings of this book, go ahead and compare this book to almost any other precalc text book for yourself. You'll quickly see that EVEN THOUGH YOU'VE PAID A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THIS BOOK TO TEACH YOU, this book FAILS TO PERFORM EVERY SINGLE STEP OF THE WAY, PARTICULARLY when you need it to CLEARLY EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU most. REALLY THIS BOOK ONLY MAKES IT HARDER TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING IT ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN. My recommendation is that you buy "THE COMPLETE IDIOTS GUIDE TO PRECALCULOUS" by W. Michael Kelly, an author who thouroughly prooves his TEACHING SKILLS, COMPETENCE and ABILITY TO SUCCESFULLY ARTICULATE concepts so students can actually get some learning out of the time they spend reading his CLEAR, HELPFULL EXPLENATIONS that will actually help you in precalculous 
 First off, I'll admit that I didn't read the whole book.  Now I'll say my peace on it.  Hacker generalizes broadly about the behaviors and sentiments of both whites and blacks.  Though white himself, he seems to absolutely  despise whites across the board as either racist scum or well-meaning but  idiotic.  Then he says that Martin Luther King Jr. only came to prominence  as a leader of the civil rights movement because the whites in power chose  him.  It sounds to me as if Hacker thinks that the black population were  too ignorant to choose there own leader and allowed the whites to give them  their hand-picked MLK Jr.  The thought of that makes me ill.  Apparently,  in Hacker's world view, everyone except himself is either evil or stupid.   But it was very entertaining 
 I used Rachel's text for my students in an undergraduate course in Ethics, and was extremely disappointed and frustrated. Rachels freely promotes his own political views and concerns in a way that severely curtails effective classroom discussion. 
 Unfortunately I bought this book hoping that it would uncover more historical data and the actual works of Veronica Franco translated by a scholar in the field. That was not the case. The author  used her college dissertation to make a book on a very important aspect of history when her dissertation would have been best served if it stayed at her college. The author takes liberty to interpret Ms. Franco's works and for the reader it is a logistical nightmare. She first gives her statement as if fact at times which makes the facts (Veronica's actual works) seem secondary. Then she would have the Italian verse, followed by a translation. Wow! do I feel very side tracked here. I wouldn't even accept this for a dissertation! Sorry, it doesn't work out in terms of literary flow, factual data or interesting storyline 
 The work of a 12 year-old without talent. Phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy, inappropriate similies. Story line is absurd. If this were Koontz's first novel, no publisher would touch it 
 I worked my way through this,and kept asking myself why. This book is the product of a certain mind set in this country that props up certain points of views and tries to silence others, there simply is no other way to explain how this got published and, pick my jaw up off the floor, a movie made.  The writing is totally uninspired. Likewise the, uhh...plot. If there is a character, meaningful dialog, descriptive passage somewhere in this thing, please invite my attention. Swofford accomplishes only one thing: makes you real happy you don't have to spend time with him other than when you are struggling with his book. It doesn't matter how you feel about war, politics, life, or anything, this is just hard labor. Yes, I've done my time in the military and in combat. Swofford can't tell anyone anything, about the Corps, any military, combat, life, or putting one foot in front of another each day. Sadly, I think that this is a tragedy, because he had the opportunity to experience much, some of it even positve, but he missed it all. The people who put their names on the cover of this book and gave it favorable comment are dispicable 
 It was impossible for me to get into this book. I ended up checking a book out at my local library to write a book review. 
 I read the Subjection of Women for my 17th Century Philosophy class.  I found it interesting, but hard to read.  Mill tends to be repetative and wordy.  He is very much the early feminist until you get to page 86 or 87 when he tells you that for all women can do, they should stay home and care for the family anyway.  I would suggest that others read this book, but give yourself time, because about 20 pages a night was all that I could muster.  At 100 pages it's not too long, but could have been said with more clarity and organization 
 This book came from a recommendation from my orthopedic.. he informed me there was pretty much nothing I could do about my low back except for "Quit with the running and high impact exercises".  This book basically tells you to sit up straight, but a back support under your lower back, and lie several times a day on your stomach, and push yourself up on your arms and hold that position to reinstate the arch in your lower back.. well, duh..  If you are in decent shape this one is not for you.  I could see where it may help if you are old, overweight, out of shape, and don't know what else to do.. 
 I was hoping to identify at least a few of the 11 different mushrooms in my garden.  Unfortunately not a single one is shown in the picture plates.  I am now in search of a better book 
 There are several reasons this book is inferior to the Harvard Blue Book (HBB).   First: no one uses it, so it's as useful as Esparanto. Second: The rules for how to cite have pages and pages of sub-rules and sometimes you must also apply rules from other sections.  Unlike the HBB though, it often doesn't tell you to see those other sections, so you're basically expected to memorize all the rules in order to know which ones to apply. Third: Where are the examples? They aren't there, at least nothing close to the scope of the HBB 
 I like Slayer.  I really do.  This is one of the fastest, heaviest metal bands in existance, but I could never get in to their early albums, especially Hell Awaits.  I tend to prefer their later albums like Reign in Blood, because they were much better produced.  Rick Rubin made those records sound the way a speed metal record should, with everything up front in your face.  Reign in Blood had the most "in your face" sound of any record I've ever heard.  Hell Awaits on the other hand is just soaked in so much reverb that it sometimes reminds me of "Pyromania" by Def Leppard!  This is one of the heaviest bands in existance.  How is a speed metal band supposed to sound heavy when their producer insists on making them in to the speed metal version of Def Leppard?  Thrash is supposed to be "in your face".  There's no place for reverb on a speed metal record.  You want to hear heavilly reverbed production, than go buy a Def Leppard CD!  I myself prefer a more aggressive style that fits this kind of music.  Down with reverb!  I HATE reverb!  Layers of reverb have no place in speed metal 
 I was actually very impressed by the material in the book and would have undoubtly given it 5 stars. BUT something very fishy made me change my mind. I applied to enroll into the Robert Allen Instiitute mentorship program for real estate investment (details are online). I got a call from the Program and a sales person like sounding gentleman, who threw around his weight and suggested multiple times that it would be an honor for me to be chosen for the mentorship program spoke to me for an hour...And then he and his supervisor suggested that if I trusted Robert Allen, I should give him my credit card number for a charge of 6000-10000$!!!!. 'It takes money to make money' he said. When I told him that he will need to tell me how many perople are actually in the program and how many actually make money, he was caught offguard...at the end of the conversation he was frankly rude and said 'Well, think about it, all you have done in your life so far is made 80000$ a year'...I mean how unclassy can you get!!...well thank you Mr Allen and your sales-people...I sure can tell how you have made your money 
 My son loves Richard Scarry, and we have two dvds he loves: Counting and ABC. This book, however is terrible. The images are chaotic and confusing. And the story is confusing, as well. Not recommended, even for Scarry fans 
 Ewing's book is about Nora Simms, the successful owner of Brickhouse, a workout center located in Harlem. The story revolves around her struggle to keep her workout center despite a local sleaze-ball Reverend's attempt to boot her. Revolving stories include her daughter's bulimia, her partner's drug abuse, her friend's marital problems and oh, a romance.   To be honest, there is a lot of potential here. Ewing's idea is fresh, her prose has a nice voice, but the book either needed to be about... 300 pages longer, or take out half of her characters' issues. Ewing just takes too much on and still tries to keep things light. It makes her book feel very shallow. Ewing clearly isn't afraid to be real, but she spreads herself so thin, she doesn't do any of the topics justice--not the substance abuse (Nona's partner's or her daughter's), not the adultery, the corruption, the struggle of young women against stereotypes--it was so FRUSTRATING!!!  Nevertheless, I did like Ewing's style, and it might be worth your time to grab from the library, but don't buy it.   P.S. pet peeves:  --repeated references to how Nona feels connected to Harlem. Has Ewing been to Harlem? I couldn't tell. Felt that was weak. Prove it! --sex scene was totally unnecessary and gross--why include it?  --are those women supposed to be Nona's friends? they're not really admirable women 
 My fellow reviewers have one of two things happening:  (1) they received different discs than I, or (2) they have been smoking some very serious stuff.   The average review is five stars?   I can give it only one which is a major disappointment!   Why?   Although the title of the CD is accurate, the quality of the disk is perfectly terrible.   A number of tracks reproduce horribly and No. 2 (There I Go) is particularly bad.   One wonders why the folks that make thse recordings can't take the time to make certain that the customer gets a decent recording for his or her money.  If original master recordings need to be cleaned up in order to give the listener a fair shake then this needs to be done.   This is a perfectly wonderful assortment of Vaughn Monroe's recordings.  It is a perfectly terrible recording of them 
 Sewers of all skill levels, borrow a copy of this book from your local library before committing to buying it.  As a seamstress with 40 years of sewing to her credit, this book is lacking in detail.  Close-up shots of fabric types, allowing the reader to get a feel for the hand and look was not available.  It would have been nice to see, in more photographic detail, how to set-in a sleeve.  The photographic instructions for hand-sewing a button hole were woefully inadequate -- dark green on dark green.  On second thought, just pass on this work and buy Singer's Complete Photo Guide to Sewing 
 This booklet contains some good information, but there is too little useful data to justify the cost.  Try David Barton's DVDs instead.  They're chock full of information 
 This is not the best book out there.  The first section of the 5 section book goes into form and shape theory, which although useful in design, is just filler to give the book more pages.  The color theory sections are fairly basic.  I think there are better books out there, especially for the price 
 I hate how this book protrays the father, as an unattached lion who watches tv rather than helping his son bloom. I bought this book for my autistic son for Christmas, read it and put it in the trash. It makes Dads look uninvolved and is not a good portrayal at all. My husband is an excellent father and certianly would not choose to watch tv over helping my son learn.  Very dissapointed in this book and honestly surprised by all these positive comments 
 I checked this book out at the local library along with a text on how to transfer course units from a business major into psychology. This book made the reference text read like a novel. Truly dreadful. Avoid this even if it's free 
 I have no idea why I saw this movie in the first place, perhaps it was because The Jungle Book is a fascinating story. However I was realy dissapointed not only is the film boring but it is very silly   (in a stupid way).The action scenes were terrible. I recommend this movie to 6 year olds who dont care about the quality of movies. 
 I usually buy OXO products because their quality is excellent. This product misses the mark however. The workmanship was shoddy and it broke before it was even installed! The idea behind it is a good one but I bought the ratchet paper towel holder as a replacement and it is the best 
 I wished I could write a good review for this book.  However, I can't.  I read it.  From a literary standpoint, the book is an obvious polemic.  Ever evil under the sun can be traced to men, Christianity, and society run by men, (in about that order).    However, her book suffers many flaws.  First, she makes some outrageous claims with absolutely no documentation.  Second, she makes some outrageous claims with WRONGFUL documentation.  That is, whenever one troubles themselves to find the book that she is referencing, it does not say what she says that it does.   Third, many of the books that she uses are outdated and also biased.  Almost none of the theories espoused by her have any connection to any modern scholarship.  For example, she says that the Arabian religion prior to Muhammad was based upon a group of female prophets who believed the Qur'an was inscribed upon the tablets of destiny much the same as the Goddess Tiamet has absolutely no verifiable reference.  I've read many Islamic studies and many dissident scholars, but none of them say that.  Wonder why?  Same, she gives no reference for that quote.  Because she is worthless as a primary reference, each and every thing she says must be independently confirmed by someone less biased and more reliable.  That means, once one goes through the trouble, two things.  First, her book is worthless as a source unto itself.  Second, whenever this trouble is undertaken, most of it is outdated or plain fabricated.  Much the same as she accuses Christian authors.  (And I have no bias toward Christianity.)  
 I'm surprised at all the good reviews this book got. Not to be snide, I just genuinely am.   This book looms in my memory as the one book I had to drag myself to finish. A book that made me tear up with boredom. The plucky heroine wasn't likable, the names were all forced and strange (none making sense in a universe together--more like an assortment of characters from different books) , not on the unique side, really.  I thought any originality forced and unfounded, and wished it would have turned out better for me, especially as the "magic dust" theory was such a nice start.  The ending wasn't predictable, but it was trying so very hard NOT to be, it couldn't possibly have been anything but what it was: Dull.  With all these good reviews, and me not having read it in years, it might be worth trying, but I stand firm: take it out of the library 
 Truth is an inherent value.  But when I speak the truth, I don't boast of it.  I simply tell people that it is they, not I, who must judge the validity of what I say.  And that they need to verify what they hear, whether it is from me or from anyone else.  These authors have more than a little nerve when they say they are speaking the truth.  Of course, most of what they say isn't true at all.    Desmond Tutu leads off with a vicious introduction.  Tutu was all in favor of human rights in South Africa.  But he sure isn't in favor of human rights in the Levant.  And he's opposed to human rights for Levantine Jews.    Michael Prior writes about the challenge of historical truth and morality.  Well, what he writes clearly shows that this challenge is far too much for him.  And the Reuthers are simply more of the same.    Ilan Pappe is next, and he says that the Israelis are in "denial."  Actually, I think Israelis typically have a very good knowledge of the history of their region, maybe better than almost any other group in the world.  But even if many Israelis had some misconceptions about their history, what relevance would that have?    Then we get to Daniel McGowan, who writes about Deir Yassin.   I think this battle was indeed a key victory in the struggle for human rights, on a par with Gettysburg or Stalingrad.  It was ugly, as over a hundred people died.  But that was a small number when you compare it with Stalingrad.  Or Gettysburg.    Ask yourselves if you wish the Germans had won at Stalingrad and just kept winning after that.  It would have made hash of Soviet Russia.  But at the cost of having all of Europe under a terrible and arbitrary tyranny.  Stalingrad wasn't pretty, but it was a battle which had a good result for our species as a whole.  And Deir Yassin wasn't pretty either.  But it was one of the first battles in which the Jews actually fought back in their war for survival.  And while the Jews may not have needed to win at Deir Yassin any more than the Russians needed to win at Stalingrad, eventually both sides needed to win somewhere or condemn quite a few people to misery.    That's not the picture we get from McGowan, who treats Deir Yassin as a Jewish war crime!  As far as I am concerned, what he writes is simply pro-terrorist propaganda.  While I certainly do not insist that he applaud Deir Yassin, I think he ought to admit that many good people do applaud it and for good reason.  And I do insist that what he does say about Deir Yassin be honest.  After all, didn't the title of the book say something about truth?    The rest of the book is no better.  There are some articles on Christians in the region which make everyone look bad.  There's an article by Paul Eisen, who wants to speak the truth to the Jews.  The truth would indeed be a good idea!   Too bad he doesn't do it.  Naseer Aruri then discusses the Arab "right of return."  More arbitrariness, more disregard for human rights.  What's next?  Maybe an explanation of why the Arabs have a right to "return" to Spain and expel the Spanish?    Elizabeth Barlow says that we need the will to act.  I thought about what would happen if we took her advice, and the implicit advice of the other authors.  Perhaps if we all did that, we'd wind up getting rid of our whole species, once and for all.  What we need instead of books like this one is the placing of more value on truth, justice, and human rights.  
 Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
 I was disappointed in this CD and have only played it once.  There was nothing about the music that "grabbed" me or even made me identify with New Orleans jazz or blues.  Not what I expected, but I was still happy to contribute to the hurricane relief effort.  
 I see now that it's rated to 250 degrees, though that's not written on the package. The first time I used it, the handle got a little too close to the flame of my stove and the end melted.  It was still serviceable, so I was more careful the next time, but apparently the cooking temperature of an omelette in a pan is higher than 250 degrees and the entire leading edge melted to my omelette and my non-stick pan, half-ruining my very expensive All-Clad pan, entirely ruining my omelette and of course the OXO Good Grip Turner. It may have a good grip, but it's not good for much else 
 This component was returned because it was not compatible with my Dell all-in-one printer. I was not alerted to this possibility by any information from the manufacturer, from the supplier, or in print on the package. I should have been 
 This is a difficult book to categorize. It is well written, contains many interesting anecdotes, but it misses the essential Orwell.  Taylor's gloomy, otherwordly, ex-Etonian, ex-imperial policeman simply does not add up to Orwell. The sum of the parts is much less than the man. Taylor's book is a bit like an autopsy, the pathologist clearly never being able to comprehend the stiff, dead flesh and bottled samples before him as the full human being they were. Nevertheless, autopsies do tell interesting tales.   Orwell's gloomy temperament puts him not outside the mainstream of writers but exactly in the company of so many important writers. The list of writers with some form of depression, whether alcoholism or gloominess, is so huge - Greene, Swift, Hemingway, Le Carré, Dickens, Gissing, O'Neill, Twain, Faulkner, etc, etc. - one comes to think of the quality almost as a job requirement. It provides one of the special lens through which critical writers see the world. One has to believe Taylor understands this, but his book conveys only clinical observations of gloominess snipped from letters, diaries, and conversations.    As far as Orwell's otherworldliness, Orwell was clearly in the great tradition of English eccentrics, and that is an important component of his appeal. There is a long and glorious line of them from Dr. Johnson and Jane Austen down to Alec Guinness, Margaret Rutherford, and Vanessa Redgrave. Yet Taylor only offers clinical observations and never puts them in their proper context.  Orwell was not an important novelist, so it seems a bit gratuitous to say so as Taylor does. In fact, he wasn't even a very good novelist. Yet books like Keep the Aspadistra Flying do provide a keen sense of his Englishness. Missing entirely from Taylor's autopsy is a sense of Orwell's quintessential Englishness. When Orwell writes of getting back to the feel of heavy English coins and having mahogany tea, readers get a sense of pure distilled Englishness. This comes through also in quasi-journalistic books like The Road to Wigan Pier or Down and Out in Paris and London - important early efforts at what today might be called investigative journalism - books which Taylor rather disparages both in terms of Orwell's re-arranging actual events and being an observer mentally wearing an Eton tie.  What Orwell was is a critic, and a rather magnificent one. I am reminded of Degas' description of Monet as "Only an eye, but what an eye!"   Orwell had an exquisite sense of justice and a very sensitive barometer for tyranny plus he had the words to convey vividly his sensibilities. Taylor virtually misses this in his examination of bile and stool samples. Taylor too often puts Orwell's political criticism down to miss-directed, soft-Left thinking of an ex-Etonian. Orwell himself recognized the simpering nature of much of the Left's views, yet he struggled bravely with finding a vocabulary to accommodate his sympathies. He possibly did not come to recognize himself for what he was, a scorching critic of both Left and Right. After all, his time was short. That is how it is when you die in your forties.  He was also an important literary critic, and while Taylor recognizes this, I don't believe he gives it a full enough examination.  Taylor sadly drags out the subject of anti-Semitism, perhaps the most overly-used epithet of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. If Orwell was anti-Semitic - and I do not believe this for a second - it was in the same vague sense of virtually all Englishmen of his time. The English have always had a degree of xenophobia, a quality whose obverse side is the very set of qualities defining Englishness. I am tired of discussions of whether Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice makes the greatest playwright in human history anti-Semitic, discussions which always ignore the human qualities and sense of justice Shakespeare gives his character, and just so, Orwell, overall a truly decent man.  There has been a good deal of writing in recent years about Orwell, much of it wrong-headed, from claims being made that he would have supported Bush's invasion of Iraq (!) to sentimentality. Little of it captures Orwell the independent and remarkably clear-thinking critic. Taylor gives us no sense of what it was that animated Orwell, other than some almost silly stuff about getting back at people like the headmistress of his school. There is almost a sense in this book of a high-class hatchet job done on Orwell, but I don't want to push that point. What makes Orwell truly important is minimized, and what wasn't important is given a good deal of weight. Perhaps that is the fate of great critics who support no one's ideologies and preconceptions.   This book should be read only with an awareness of its limited approach to the subject. This is not Orwell, but a somewhat interesting display of bits and memorabilia in museum cabinets.  Please see my review of Gordon Bowker's Orwell biography, a superior work (published in the same year) in most respects to Taylor's.    
 it's not a graphic novel like "Maus" was at all.  I would return it, but it's not even worth it.... 
 I don't care what other reviewers say, but this bed rail sucked!!  I used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed.  It took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed.  And it would constantly come unlocked.  And if I buy another bed rail for our next child it won't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty.  I can't remember if this cover was removable or not, if it was I'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove 
 Would have liked to know what other readers thought - I care naught for what this author did on his book tour.  One more ploy to force plogs on us.Phooey.  In case anyone cares- I liked the book 
 Cool idea BUT, this isn't really worth it.  I bought it for myself but would never use it.  On a positive note my 14 yr old liked it.  I wouldn't recommend it for an adult.  
 To me communicating with confidence means: subject, verb, satelites(objects)...BUT, here we have Booher give us a laudry list of "behavioral" dos and dont's.  I felt almost like I was reading commandments.  Thou salt not pout!! (really I'm not making that up as that's one of the tips) Probably more suited for a younger audience, as I felt Booher "talked down" to me througout.  I wish I could find a better book on the subject.  This was not it.  I felt quite unsatisfied having purchased Communicate with Confidence 
 Brueggemann is as always a good writer and his commentary is easy to read and very interesting. Howevever, a major problem is that it is difficult to dicern what he actually is commenting. Is it the literary text or the historical events? When Brueggemann for instance discusses Samuel or David he mixes the logic so that you never now if he is talking about the character or the "real, historic" persons and their motives. As a result he tend to introduce explanations - motives, parties etc - that is not the explanations of the text or the so called narrator. It would have been better if he had distinguished between the analysis of the text and his suggestions about "what really happened".   
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 Mainly a series of names and dates.   Difficult to get through - not an interesting writing style 
 This is nonsense. Who really cares to hear every lame ass detail of this "has-been's" life? Not i sir, not i 
 A book on human morfologic evolution and ancient tools (stones). A few words on culture precisely. If you dont want to read about bones, stones, more bones and more  stones read instead "The Prehistory  of the Mind", by Steven Mithen.    
 In the process of building a website targeted to those good folks that are striving valiantly to make a living through Internet marketing, you might think that an early objective would be to assemble a library of good reference material. After all, if you are planning on providing sensible information to your readers, then you should have a few good text books on hand to refer to when you need to be sure that some little tidbit of information might actually work. Well, at least I did. So, I have been scouring the Internet for textbook on the subject of Forecasting, which we share a common interest in. I have purchased a few and, for the most part, they are really quite informative and will be useful when the time comes. There is, however, an exception to this.  One book I purchased bears the title "Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting, Brockwell, Peter J and Richard A Davis". Being an intelligent sort of chap, I naturally took the word "Introduction" to mean just that. You know, you've been introduced to people before and becoming introduced usually means that 1. You look at the face. 2. You grasp their hand and shake firmly and 3. You exchange pleasantries, such as "Hello, it's nice to meet you".  Now, I never blame the person making the introduction if the relationship doesn't work out. After all, it's not their fault that two people hopefully sharing a common interest (after all, why bother making an introduction?) aren't all that compatible. There are likely to be many reasons for the incompatibility, the first of which could be that people travel in different circles and your circle isn't ever going to be part of their circle. Sort of an exclusionary relationship, you might say. And, not to be overly judgmental of others, of course, there may be plenty of good reasons for that. If everyone existed in one social circle, after all, the world would be beyond boring.  Anyways, the text book is a wonderful creation, that is, if you're a post-graduate or doctoral candidate. Upon opening the cover, expecting to be warmly introduced, I was rather amazed at the depth of equations and formulas gracing practically every page. I felt intimidated immediately. Remember the movie "The Ring"? This had to be rocket science, or more correctly, forecasting science at its most extreme! Wow! I should have really paid more attention during my statistics classes. So, I quickly closed the cover and tried to get a refund from the seller. Note the word Tried here. They didn't want it back either. The good Post-Grand and PhD. candidates of the science of forecasting probably don't need an "Introduction" to Time Series and Forecasting. Next time I buy a book, I think I'll look for something with "Sandbox" in the title.  May all your Forecasts be Good Forecasts at [...] 
 Here's a sampling from "The Iron Dragon's Daughter"  "Behind the bar was an enormous glass tank, lit by harsh fluorescents, where the rest of the club was bathed in red and purple. A horse was drowning in the tank. Legs churning up clouds of bubbles. Eyes bloodshot and wild, it craned it's neck to lift agonized nostrils above the thrashing surface. The music was slow and romantic, but just loud enough that the horse struggled in silence."  That is obscene. It made me physically ill to where I was sweating and sick my stomach. And we wonder why violence and abuse are becoming excepted/excusable behaviors. This sort of stuff, imo, doesn't help.  Swanwick ought to be ashamed of himself for even having such thoughts let alone putting them in a book where 70% of its readers will be kids.  What's a kid, or anyone for that matter, suppose to make of that bar w/ drowning horse scene? What's MS trying to say? That hey! slowly KILLING an innocent creature is COOL entertainment. All it said to me was just how much of a sick SOB Swanwick is.  Everybody in this book uses the "F" word along with every other foul word you can think of, copiously. The higher the page# the higher the "F" count.  I don't care what you're trying to do with a story, foul language will destroy, not enhance it. Just like in real life, foul language demeans and destroys. That's what it's all about.   In class one day Jane's teacher ("fat old Grunt") "Thrust his hand between her legs and snatched up at her crotch. The class convulsed with mirth, all of them braying, snorting, snickering, laughing as if they had never seen him pull this joke before."   Huh?    This is the rudest, crudest, foulest sci/fi fantasy book I've ever read.  AND to top it all off .. THERE IS NO STORY!  There is no rhyme nor reason.   Whether Swanwick likes it or not, as an author of mostly kid read books he has, imo, some moral and social responsibility. He dropped the ball here.  I've never given censorship a thought until this book.  But I'm asking my library to pull it off our shelves. I admit, I don't want anyone, especially kids, to read this book. It's pure ugly evil. It shats on you. It's an insult to your intelligence.   Of course Swanwick is laughing all the way to the bank.    
 The barn is really cute and tall for older kids.  However, it does not "pop" up, there are three rods you have to put in and out when putting it up and down.  Also, once put together, it stood crooked, so it would not stay up.  If you got it just right, it would remain standing, until one of the kids went into it.  I am talking a 19 month old, not a 12 year old crashing it.  Needless to say, we sent it back and will look for something better.  OH, send it back via Amazon.  The company called me back after a full week, and wanted $15 included with the returned tent (shipping on you).  Things that make you say hmmmmmm 
   I think the Linda Howard who wrote White Lies, Sarah's Child, Duncan's Bride, MacKenzies Mountain, Diamond Bay,etc. is one of the most talented current romance writers.  Unfortunately, when she gave up the genre romances and turned to the "big Time", her writing started to decline. She is clearly in over her head now.  What a shame she couldn't stick to a format in which she excelled and warmed the hearts of millions of readers.   This just goes to show that one should figure out where one excels and stick to it. This is pure "Peter Principle" in action. Too bad 
 People are SO gullable, how many morons carry around this book while listening to Marilyn Manson on their ipods thinking that they are exploring the "dark arts"? Lovecraft invented the Necronomican to tie his stories together into what has become known as the Cthulu mythos. I can't fault the author for trying to make a buck but anyone who thinks this is anything but fiction should contact me about a bridge I'm selling in Brooklyn 
 If only every being that said it was an angel really was one.  But in this case, as in so many others, to announce that there are no entities, dark forces, or - dare I say it? - evil - is a naive belief held by those who dabble in spirituality and really have no solid foundation in its practices.  Much of the info in this book is misleading, although the authors seem to have the best intentions and have definitely put in much work.  I originally bought this book for its info on ascension.  There is some truth in what's laid out here to make it seem right, but again, some of it is misleading.  For those who are truly interested in real spiritual growth and ascension, which has already begun, seek out true spiritual teachers who have walked the road and traveled the distances.  They are few 
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 Since Im' a fan of street fighter, i bought this dvd when i first saw it at a store. It's a waste of money. At least if they had thrown in a poster it would have had some value. You see Ryu and Akuma on the cover and you think" these guys are going to fight!!Finally." That's what i thought,after of course watching the first Alpha movie and them not fighting each other. But this movie was a complete gimmick to rake in some quick dollars at the expense of all the fans who were expecting so much more. The animation itself is pretty bad. The fight scenes are pathetic for this day and age. There is nothing memeroble about this movie. The only thing I can clearly remember is the scene when Sakura and the other girl are in the bath togather, and even then you don't see much. The other thing is Akuma looks terrible. They should draw him the way he looks in Capcom vs Snk 2. And what's even more annoying is they call him by his lesser known name "Gouki" throughout the whole movie. Anyone who is a fan of the franchise will have to see it to believe it, just don't expect much and whatever you do, don't buy it 
 The "filler" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from "Rebel Heart" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all! 
 I never write in reviews but this is the worst cookbook I've ever bought.  We probably have 40 or 50.    There are only 101 recipes and 7 of them are for either rabbit or venison.  I don't know anyone who cooks either.   The index in the back is listed in page order.  I'm not making this up.  Usually you turn to the back and look up beef or chicken or whatever and it shows you the recipes for that ingredient.  When you look at the index here it gives the name of the recipe on the first page and then the 2nd page.   Don't buy this!  I'd give it a zero if I could.       
 Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first "Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.    The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.  The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the "dump and stir" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.    It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The "Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called "The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook."  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.  Go for it! 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 This DVD gives documentary coverage concerning such DA VINCI CODE topics as Rosslyn Chapel, the Priory of Scion, the Knights Templar, the Gnostic Gospels, Le Dossier Secrets, Da Vinci paintings, and Opus Dei.  This DVD, BEYOND THE DA VINCI CODE seems to bend over backwards, measuring every narrated word, to try to support and be sympathetic towards the Dan Brown allegations made in his novel--despite the evidence and expert interviews that they themselves provide in this documentary, they still seem to be in favor of what Dan Brown has written in the DA VINCI CODE.  Out of a half dozen expert interviewees, the most notable are two "big" names who are MAJOR influences on THE DA VINCI CODE book. Margaret Starbird, author of THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR; and Richard Leigh, one of three authors of HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, (which was a NY Times Bestseller in 1982), both appear throughout this program.   These two are probably the biggest proponents of the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy today, after Dan Brown himself. So it is especially meaningful when Richard Leigh and Margaret Starbird disagree with what Dan Brown has written!  According to expert interviewee Richard Leigh, though THE DA VINCI CODE book says that the Knights Templar found documents to prove the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy, in reality, NOBODY knows what, if anything, was found by the Knights Templar in Solomon's Temple.   Leigh also says the whole business about the pentagram, pentacles, 5-pointed stars as mainly representing the "sacred feminine" is NONSENSE--that symbol has been used throughout history to represent other things just as often!   Richard Leigh also explains that the original Priory of Scion was last referenced in 1619, but the modern day Priory of Scion people from the last 50 years are "bonkers," trying to present a hoax of the LE DOSSIER SECRETS, to try to gain political influence for themselves.   This LE DOSSIER SECRETS, which appears on the bogus "FACT" page at the beginning of THE DA VINCI CODE book attempts to show a traceable genealogy of descendents of Jesus, but has been debunked for decades in France. It does NOT belong on a page titled "FACT" in the DA VINCI CODE book! That is very misleading, not factual. Brown says the LE DOSSIER SECRETS were discovered, but leaves out the fact that they are commonly known to be phoney!  Margaret Starbird, another major influence on the Dan Brown novel, says that even though she believes in the Jesus/Magdalene bloodline, there is NO PROOF of the bloodline lasting into the French Merovingian line of kings, circa the first millenium A.D.  The documentary, using other expert interviewees and location footage, goes on to debunk the ridiculous claim of the Rose Line alignments being found in significant locations throughout THE DA VINCI CODE novel; as well as showing there is no evidence that Leonardo Da Vinci was a member of the Priory of Scion, let alone the Grandmaster; the rose is NOT the symbol for the Priory of Scion; and Opus Dei has NO INTEREST in the "secret" bloodline of Jesus/Magdalene because they don't believe it even exists.  Sadly, most of the debunking occurs towards the end of the show, in brief statements, before quickly moving on to the next topic; while most of the screen time is spent romanticizing and retelling what Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE book claims about the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy.  Overall I was disappointed by this HISTORY CHANNEL DVD for presenting such seemingly wishful support while showing that so much just ain't so in the DA VINCI CODE book--though I am not surprised, the HISTORY CHANNEL usually sides against Christianity on issues to support atheism in their shows, in my opinion.  A much better DA VINCI CODE debunking DVD is BREAKING THE DA VINCI CODE, which more clearly presents the evidence without romanticizing the novel's lies about history and Jesus 
 It's not surprising that Brad Gooch, a professional homosexual, writes a book that makes Frank O'Hara appear to be nothing more than another professional homosexual. Actually, Gooch may be right. O'Hara is an incredibly minor figure in American poetry, and this books devotes too much print to a third-rate writer who would probably best be forgotten 
 Read the plan carefully.  Not everything is covered under this plan.  They will use any excuse they can to say that the product broke under unusual circumstances so they don't have to pay.  Too many exclusions for an "everything is covered policy"  Don't waste your mone 
 I've read this book out of curiosity, but unfortunetely found it to be without real or factual substance and no objective conclusion. Rather, it was politically motivated and written by someone who is naturally biased towards Isreal, and could not possibly have the objectivity nor the intention to write the full truth. Saudi Arabia may be a country with many extremists and people who hate America or the west, but we cannot take this view without looking at the big picture and all other factors including Isreal and the Isreali Arab conflict into consideration as well as the Amrican role in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Middle Eastern regimes that are supported by the United States. Therefore, I can honestly say that this book is worthless, dangerously biased, and incite hatred rather than understanding 
 Sorry, but this geek is not jumping on the geekwagon.  Despite being sub'ed Adventures in Adolescence, many of the anecdotes actually deal with the author's pre-adolescent years, coming of age-olescence if you will, and frankly they are the funnier entries.  (But am I wrong to doubt that the author could really start having orgasmic experiences at age 7?) The biggest problem is that the germ obsession sets the author apart from the typical geek, who would have gladly braved a little [spoiler warning here] puke breath to make out with a cute girl, and way too many of the experiences described in the book deal with that phobia.  There are 2-3 laugh out loud passages, 6-8 cleverly turned phrases, but they don't make up for the laborious redundancies - Bill, we get it about the rope, enough with the "25 foot lover" references, the repeated return to the mincing descriptions, etc.  
 James is a great literary virtuoso, in certain ways the most sophisticated and complex America has had. His intricate intelligence is complemented by an unequaled descriptive power, and a mastery of language, second to none. How difficult then to come across the passage which ruins this book for me. This is James description of the immigrant Jews on the East Side.It is the observation of the sterile aristrocatic owner of Anglo-Saxon civilization who looks with contempt and horror at the poor swarming sweatshop crowd threatening to steal his private inheritance from him.  
 Despite my one-star rating, this is an acceptable time-killer: good-natured, forgettable and not real bright.  Poor Hilary Swank - from that movie where she was a boy to this in a few short years.  Of course, her fall wasn't as steep as Cuba Gooding's (from Jerry Maguire to Boat Trip in one movie) or Jamie Foxx's (from Ray to Stealth in one movie).  She looks like Jolene Blalock - T'Pol from TV's Star Trek Enterprise, and it wasn't until the credits that I realized it was actually Swank and not Blalock in the movie.  Perhaps Swank was trying to camouflage herself.  The movie begins with a space shuttle landing in the LA River, which is interesting, but has nothing at all to do with the rest of the movie.  Next thing you know, the valiant pilot is recruited to some mission to drill to the center of the earth to restart the core, which got some spyware or something and stopped working.  As a result, the Coliseum and the Golden Gate Bridge get wiped out by lightning.  Don't ask.  The Feds then assemble a team to take a magic vehicle to the core, drop some nukes, and reboot the earth.    We learn some interesting things on the way, such as: Molten rock is completely clear.  There are really unconvincing sets with big fake crystals deep inside the earth.  And, if you're a jerk, you'll get killed by rolling nuclear weapons and then repent.    You can guess how it ends.  It's not great art, but it's dumb fun on a rainy day 
 This year, 60% of college entries will be female.  Look at this spring's honor role listings.  Last year, 78% of honor role members in my community were female.  Schools are fails boys - not girls.  If you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap, then get this book.  If you want to really improve the quality of education, there are thousands of reads better than this 
 My first Finder book was a library audio book read by Scott Brick. I thought the corporate world of electronic sales made a nice backdrop for a thriller and initially I found the story fresh and entertaining.  I later found the story to be too unrealistic with too many unlikable characters.   Finder does an excellent job illustrating the villain Kurt Semko (I kept seeing country star Trace Adkins with a haircut) and moving the story along at a nice clip, but the protagonist kept coming across like a wise-cracking schmuck which supressed the entertainment value for this reader 
 I wavered awhile between three stars and two stars, because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as Sony and Akio Morita seem to deserve at least three. However, in the end, the book's errors just piled too high. It opens well, with the story of Sony's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after World War II, to becoming one of the world's great companies. This is a fascinating and inspiring story, and Morita tells it with flair.  Then, unfortunately, the downward spiral begins. Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every other Japanese company operates the same way, which is a fantastically wrong assertion (as the last thirteen years of Japan's seemingly endless recession have shown). He also frequently takes good basic management techniques, like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway, and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely "Japanese".  Then there are all the claims which are simply out-and-out false, such as Japan supposedly having the world's best construction technology. (It actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world, as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated.)  Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything. (Yet it only recently discovered the concept of "second-hand goods", instead of throwing nearly-new furniture and clothing away. Plus, Japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world's worst overpackaging.)  Reading between the lines, a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that Japan faces today. For example, Morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States. While this can, of course, sometimes be a serious problem, it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves. Japan's consumers, on the other hand, without an accessible court system, are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives. Complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored, because they lack any threat of legal action. In another example, Morita praises the "trust" and agreements without contracts that exist among Japanese corporations. In reality, this "trust" is a death pact, as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies, instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs.  Other than the glimpses into Sony's history and corporate culture, this book is only interesting as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of "Japan is going to take over" books that came out in the Eighties. Although, of course, considering all the "Internet companies are going to take over" books that came out in the Nineties, not even this is a uniquely "Japanese" phenomenon.   PS: Anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of Japan should read "Dogs and Demons" by Alex Kerr. 
 There's nothing here that any actor with half a brain couldn't find for him/herself by renting some good flicks.  Why pay the extra money.  At least when you rent the movies, you get the added enjoyment of watching  them.  Come on guys, are we all so lazy we can't transcribe a few film  scenes for ourselves.  Also, there is a lot of repetition in that some  films are represented by as many as 3 different scenes.  I think the  author/editor might have worked a little harder for some diversity 
 This movie turned me off with its focus on Nash's schizophrenia rather than his monumental achievements. Three-fourths of the movie turns out to be Nash's delusion. I felt like a voyeur, entertained by someone else's pain.  At the end, I wasn't even certain of exactly what it was that Nash had developed....just that he was a brilliant mathematician and severely ill. The barbaric "medical treatment" of the 1950s left me feeling sick.   A documentary would have been far more entertaining. Nash is a brilliant man despite, not because of, his illness, and I found this movie (especially since much of it is fictionalized) to be exploitive. Only two stars 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help 
  Alas, I only made it to page 157 so perhaps I shouldn't even be allowed to comment but I was so tired of the wishy washy main character who could rain so much misery on her own life I couldn't go on another page. I loved Rule of the Bone, it's one of my favorite books but this one left me cold. 
 I think Ms Hewitt misses the mark, yes for an actress turned singer she's ok and its more her acting clout that has landed her this record deal and not her talent as a singer... Would someone off the street with the same looks and musical level get a record deal? I think not... Same goes for the other Latin Jennifer.. 
 Half of these stories I have read before, and the other half I did not like. Everything in this book is pointless. First of all, Sedaris' name in big letters on the cover. Why? Because he wrote a silly introductiuon and made this awkward selection. The reason the book is published? To benefit some cause that most of us could have not cared less about. Well, I am giving two stars and not one, just because I liked the color of the cover. Kind of greenish salad color. 
 Sometimes it works ok. Sometimes it stops swinging for no reason. sometimes turning on the mobile will instead turn on the music. it always makes a gringing noise when swinging. if it worked like it should it would be a great product. i like the stars projected below- when they work 
 ...become the most irritating elevator pablum ever concieved. Perfect for Stepfords everywhere! Not music, but a powerful central nervous system depressant that may cause permanent organic brain damage! Not Music! Avoid 
 Borrow the book from the library.  Wasting your money on fables is not wise (unless you like wasting money).  While entertaining, this is not worthy of a library collection item 
 Williamson does a great job describing the goddess and valuing our feminity. Readers will get that usual warm fuzzy feeling that Marianne is so good at evoking. In the dozen plus years since writing this book it seems that her own advice just doesn't cut it anymore than weekly psychotherapy sessions do for others. Perhaps the "imbalance of male/female energies" in the world is to blame. Williamson's lectures or "ministry" seem to reflect a segment of the female population that are highly intelligent, well-educated, articulate, charismatic, attractive, and a basket of neurotic therapy junkies. There is a distinction between maintaining well-being and indulging in self-help addiction at the expense of your life. Williamson's Woman's Worth appeals to an audience of modern women seeking solace or hiding their desire for an M.R.S. degree. Jean Shinoda Bolen's "Goddesses in Everywoman" is a real classic from the early 1990's. If you're looking to have Jungian archetypes on a feminine divine force empower you woman-ness ... pick up Bolen's books instead. For all Marianne's mantra of women power ... she still grips in her latest book about turning 50, having no man in her life, and the other usual complainsts since her lectures on metaphysics began in 1983 ... mainly about men leaving her for someone they love enough to marry. Williamson's "student of life" content, heavily borrowed from all sorts of Bay Area New Age "stuff", is great for anyone who wants to scratch the surface of spirituality rather than deepen into it. My humble advice: take-up Buddhism, see a real therapist, and listen to women who are living the life YOU want in different areas (love, career, health, etc).   As for metaphysics  ... better off reading grounded lessons from Lynn Robinson, Penney Pierce, Sonia Choquette, Cheryl Richardson, and Julia Cameron. No one has a perfect life, but do look at how they strive to live their life in daily actions (remember - we all make mistakes, at times quite foolish) ... and consider it in selecting an informal guide and wise woman 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 I read this book hoping to find another way to try and treat my dogs skin problems and with the interest to start feeding him more rare food (less kibble).    However this book tends toward more of an extreme view STRONGLY recommending only feeding your pet human organic food and bottled water (i love my dog but if I dont drink bottled water and eat organic food he doesnt need to).  There were 3 "booster mix" recipes to add to a kibble diet that were okay.   The recipes seem expensive, especially if you have large dogs, but the ingredients are broken down and ordered by cost per protein gram on a handy chart.    The biggest flaws were the suggestions that we just inaccurate.  For instance recommending dried fruits such raisins, when in fact raisins, like chocolate, grapes, and alcohol are toxic to dogs.  PLEASE DONT FEED THOSE TO YOUR DOGS!!!!  Inaccuracies like that make me question the validity of the rest of the book.  I would recommend double checking any advice from this book before following it 
 I agree with those that say this book would be more useful if it came with solutions.  Right off in the first chapter, hypothetical situations are presented without any background information in the text.  If you haven't had some experience in Accounting, you are going to be left scratching your head.  The instructor in my class says that it causes you to think.  Hard to think if you have never come close to experiencing anything that is being discussed.  Some guidance would be helpful 
 We would love to review this item! But first we would have to be in receipt of same! We ordered early Feb 06 and have still not received the item. We are aware that we have been charged for it (in excess of the advertised price! Can we anticipate delivery this year? Incidentally the site is similar to a phone cal to a large organisation - no human contact, and no given email address to complain to!~ 
 This 2002 copyright book I bought (thought I was getting most recent version) is not a good book. Dont buy it. Way too much fluff.   PDF File on CD didnt work at first. Eventually got it to work, but shouldn't an adobe file work wihtout having to contact tech support 
 First off, when I recieved the book there was a cigarette hole burned on one of the pages. (Nice one!) Right out of the package.  Then when I opened it, I realized that all the claims that the book is based around are pretty far fetched and really cannot be substantiated.  Every time the Bible used the words like: Evil Ones, Sinner, Wicked, etc. aren't really talking about people, but fallen angels....ummm...what?!    Supposedly John the Baptist refuted these angels in the gospels by saying, "You brood of Vipers!"  Umm...it doesn't take a rocket scientist to prove that in the sentence before (or the current one) says that he's talking with the Pharisees and Saduccees.  The Bible is very clear on that point and I'm not sure what the writer was thinking.    Too much conjecture, and false analogies in my opinion.  I'm really sorry I bought this book.  I wished whoever burned the one page burned the rest of it too 
 Caps jammed inside and no way to get them out.  My son was extremely disappointe 
 I don't care what others may say about the capabilities of the director, producer, cast, cinematographer...nothing, and I mean NOTHING is capable of redeeming this sappy production. The scenes utilizing miniature buildings look like they should be under a Christmas tree, with the only good aspect of the film being the flying scenes borrowed from 633 Squadron. David McCallum is an expressionless bore, while the action scenes of the special bombs look more like elderly lawn bowling. Oh no! Look out Dave! When you bank your plane right your left wing is missing! Studio oversight or did they just figure we're all dumb enough not to notice?  I give it 2 stars instead of one only because of the fact the story actually involves the Barnes Wallis designed Hi Ball weapons that were an off-shoot of the bouncing bombs he designed for the Dam Busters, even though they were to be used on water. Laughable at best...skip it 
 This is one of the worst attempts ever seen at being an authoritative sourcebook.  The author references himself, often in this very same book, numerous times throughout.  Nothing new here as every entry is culled from other, better sources, and many of the excerpts are shallow at best.  Overall writing style is poor.  Do yourself a favor and pass this one up.  If you recently bought it, return the thing and save some money with which you can buy some decent books on lycanthropy.  Whatever you do, do not take Brad Steiger's words seriously.  Of course, it *could* be good for a laugh or two, but what little bit of rubbish isn't 
 This cd is stupid. Going to see Mama Mia is one thing.  It's fun.  But why the hell would you want to listen to the cast singing ABBA songs instead of just getting The Definitive Collection or ABBA GOLD?  Don't waste your money on this karaoke crap.  Get the real deal 
 I wanted to take a quick look over the internet but the people who programed this site will not let you scan the book for one second. It is sad that you would have to by the book just to look for one sorry thing. And I am ashamed at the situation.And at the creaters of this site for not giving anyone the chance to look before they buy 
 When I first bought this cd I really liked it, but unlike most other cd's it sounded worse with time. After 2-3 months it was just sitting in my drawer and I found myself skipping stations on the radio when they played the Killers. After seeing them live at the Virgin Festival this weekend I know they are totally phony, not only is their cd bland but they are the worst live band ever. Do yourself a favor save your money on this one 
 Lets face it, you're not buying the Nike + ipod for its stopwatch feature, you're buying it for all the other wonderful calculations that it can do.  After a couple of weeks, the system is pretty much a waste for me.  I wear the sensor in a shoe pouch which was designed for the sensor (Nike will likely never make shoes to fit my 10EEEE feet).  I have read reviews that the shoe pouch system works fine.  Here are some examples of my results:  80 minute easy run, appx. 6 miles, the system reported that I had run 1.26 miles.  25 minute easy run, appx. 2.5 miles, the system reported that I had run .21 miles.  2 times around the same track, fast pace, the system reported that I had run .21 and .24 KM (same lane).  Nike admits that the system can be 10% off before calibration.  I couldn't get it to calibrate because it kept indicating that I had not gone far enough (although I had).  On the Nike + ipod forums, I've seen a good deal of complaining that the system is often off by 20 - 30% or more, even after calibration.  My results seem much worse than average.  I'm used to a good bit of "odd behavior" from electronics and software, so I'm willing to take a good bit in stride.  The Nike + ipod, however, performed far worse than anticipated out of the box.    For me,the Nike + ipod is essentially a stopwatch that is linked to my ipod Nano (which makes it a good deal harder to use than the stopwatch on my wrist), that has a nice voice, and will give me feedback as to how much time I've been running or how much time I have left.  Since many of the Nike + ipod website features have to do with the distance sensor (log your miles, challenge others, etc.) those features are worthless for me.  I'll still use it until the battery runs out; why not?  And I'll be glad to update this review if it starts working better.  But so far, I think two stars is generous.   
 If you haven't met me before, I'm Skullface Mcfireball (sfmf for short). I have this book, and I wouldn't reccomend it. It shows how to draw Mario, Yoshi, Luigi, Toad, DK, and more. But no Bowser! Krog is the most silmilar to him, but I can't belive no Bowser! Who is Krog anyway? whatever, see ya peoples 
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 Estrich is far from unbiased and makes an attempt to come off as such. She's in the hip pocket of the Liberals and is exactaly what her book claims Coulter and her fans are. A friend forced me to reed this claiming it would forever change my views. Quite the opposite.  Ann Coulter wrote her book standing up for conservatives and Christians since people like Estrich is out there trying to say the liberal way a good person would think. Everything else is wrong. She now comes out with phony outrage and tries to claim that the conservatives are the ones who have been attacking. Fact is Bill Clinton did do monumentally fould and dangerous things to this country.  When Clinton was in office Estrich defended everything he did. We had 8 terrorist attacks under Clinton and she felt it was appauling to speek so negatively about a seeted president. What a double standard.  Now with this book she shows phoney moral outrage and copies Coulter trying to reverse the flow.   If you can, borrow this book, don't waste your money. reed it if you plan to argue with someone though. It is full of flawed logic and total bull. It will make your arguing easy. Libs hate facts 
 Like many say it has a nice design but functionally it is poor.  The Glass Jar has 8 parts, the Steel Jar has 7 parts, and glass jar broke within 6 months of light use.  I also second the fact that this unit is prone to leaking and as a professional chef I can tell you this is not worth the time or money as there are better products out there 
 This book just didn't get started for me.  I'm still trying to get interested in it...and for me not to be able to keep a Marcia Muller book in my hands until I'm done is unthinkable. 
 I know this is not saying much but this CD is actually BETTER than their self-titled debut album.  Why do I say that?  Because that album was overhyped with their hit song "White Tee" (which by the way I still never liked) and the rest of their album pretty much sounded the same production and lyric wise.  The main problem with all these south artist and groups is that they all rap mainly about the same stuff, cars, money, girls and the don't F with me I'm the best now tracks.  But back to the actual album there is some versatility in the songs but unfortunatley they cover the same material most south artists are rapping about whether it's about sex "Freaky As She Wanna Be", the I'm hot now track, "Give Props", cars in "Ridin Rims", and of course the don't F with me song "Don't Play With Me".  I know it does help to have Jermaine Dupri produce your album for you but it doesn't help when he, Bow Wow and Da Brat outshines you on your own track on "I Think They Like Me (Remix)".  Speaking of getting outshine by guest artist, Bun-B does the same thing on "My Music", and ditto for Three 6 Mafia on "Don't Play With Me".  Of course everyone has heard their club banger "Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It" which helped boost snap music but after a while even that song wore on me.  Yes the Franchize have helped along with D4L kick start the snap music craze, and this album is nice enough for a party.  But those who want something with real lyrics will have to check elsewhere 
 The tale of a fictional woman living at the French Court during the 17th century reign of Henry II. It is a very slow read at first, but then the pace picks up. Many real historical figures make an appearance, either in person or in gossip. A nice historical romance thus far, with plenty of detailed court intrigues. While the main character (and her mother) are fictional, the rest of the characters are not (including the Prince of Cleves himself, who never married in real life).  Keeping in mind the period this was written, it's quite good.  But the constant referring to characters by titles/surnames rather than given names got very old, and I found Madame de Cleves too hypocritical to like the character 
 It's a very strange thing when "extremely harsh criticism" is cited as evidence of value. Is it just possibly that this book was harshly criticized because it deserves to be, because it is a very sorry excuse for a work of musical--and, for that matter, sociological--scholarship? I think it IS possible. I think it is more than possible; I think it is quite likely. It is "readable" for non-musicians not in spite of its "scholarly content", but only in that it lacks "scholarly content"; it is not particularly well written. Obviously, it has its partisan proponents--the sort of people who don't like having to think subtly or deeply but who still want to be taken seriously, the sort of pseudo-intellectual people who want to have it both ways--, but this is no recommendation 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
   I'll start by saying that I am a huge fan of Fantasy novels, but this 'crux' of Fantasy literature really disappointed me.   This book has a lot of faults. To begin with, it goes against the first basic rule of writing a book: show don't tell. As you start the novel, it tells everything and nothing has been shown. Tolkein has just narrated almost everything, starting from the history to the setting, and this gives the novel a feeling as if a child has written it.   Secondly, the book is just too slow. I mean you just start the 1st chapter and you doze off after a couple of pages. The pace might have been fine for the 50's but it's just too slow for the double Os!   I don't know why other people liked the plot so much, but I think the plot was really really weak. The causality in the story is almost non-existant and that is what makes the difference between a jumble of short stories joined loosely together and a good novel.   Lastly, the characters could have been much developed with more life in them than mere puppets bound to do the author's bidding. The chracters are much more Archetyped than they should have been.   Overall, I think that it has gotten more attention than it deserved, perhaps because of the movies, and that people are liking it because of some trend or the like 
 I attempted to watch this film a few different times. I could just never quite get to the end. It's not because it's a particularly bad movie in fact it's just a modern day version of James Bond... its just that it never really excited me. The one redeeming factor is the car - it really becomes a character of its own 
 Well, we finally know the identity of Deep Throat as W. Mark Felt came out of the closet yesterday and quelled the "Who Is He/She?", game.  Therefore, this book is now completely outdated, irrelevant, and not worth the effort.  This book was a wasted effort from the beginning, however, now it is not even worth the paper it is printed on 
 I read a lot. A LOT. And rarely have I read a book that I really, really didn't like, but this is one of them. There is such a lack of dialogue, and the author repeats her same thoughts over and over. I swear, if I would have had to read the words "four years" one more time (referring to the main character's failed relationship) I would have hurt somebody. There was so much that could have been done with this book. But, by the time she actually gets the house, you've been bored stiff for four years and don't much care. It seems to be that it was poorly edited, and there is a lot of awkward grammar. I was really disappointed. 
 If there is a Donald Trump in the nanny business Ms. Kline would surely be hosting the next Apprentice show except that she does not seem to have the same gravitaz that Mr. Trump demonstrates.  Name-dropping and full bragging of how important she is to the "over achieving" parents who are basically folks trying to integrate work and family lifestyles does not make Ms. Kline a likeable decent person.  (Whether you agree with how the parents are spending their time or not) Instead of being empathetic, Ms. Kline comes across as a self-ordained I-am-a-very-important person in Washington.  She brags about the fact she can choose you as a client and gets more important clients than she really cares for.  The book is a quick easy read, but there is no substance and a lot of snide remarks on Ms. Kline's clients make her a character that any parent should stay away from 
 Le siempre realmente realmente han aburrido y se han decidido para encontrar un libro realmente bueno para leer? Si usted necesita uno, incluso no incomode con éste. Esto estaría en la tapa de la pila de los  libros a quemarse en el libro Fahrenheit 451. No lea esto si usted valora  su vida 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 Only,if you need serious handholding while doing "The Artist's Way," this might possibly be helpful. It is basically a blank book with the sugested 3 pages ticked off for each writing session. The author threw in some quotes from the book and a couple of paragraphs in the weekly segments. Also, there is no extra room to do some of the exercises each week--a feature that  would have been helpful. It isn't even very comfortable to write in. I wish I had looked a little harder at it when making my purchase 
 I purchased this set, and upon arrival, I found the circular polarizer to be defective.  Amazon quickly replaced the set, and this polarizer did not work either!  I returned the set, as I am not going to waste any more time trying to get a polarizer that works.  I'll pay more, and get a quality product from a different maker.  I will say that Amazon is second to nobody for customer service.  I appreciate that, and will continue to be an Amazon customer.  However, I can't say the same for Tiffen. 
 It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
 The ideas are trite, the prose is pre-sophomoric, and the little introductions by the author that precede each story are nauseatingly self-centered. One of them (preceding "Shadow of the Mothaship") says: "The way I write stories is really stupid [...]". Hear, hear! I can't imagine why Bruce Sterling endorsed this puerile effluvium 
 I purchased this book as a going to bed book for my baby girl.  It puts me to sleep before I can even get halfway through it (so I guess it's effective).  Way too long in my opinion 
 I have been a loyal Sony product user for over 30 years.  However, their Compact Disc Recorder RCD-W500C/W100 is the most confusing piece of equipment to operate that I have ever seen.  It reminds me of apparently the latest manufacturing thought about anything high tech- incorporate as many bells and whistles as you can to accommodate everyone's tastes.  For instance, why does it need a remote?  How many people will be cutting CDs from their easy chairs?  I have a call in to two friends who I hope can rescue me from my dilemma 
 I do not wish to dissect this book line by line, nor to clarify for review readers where I stand on the issues presented in the book. (Other reviewers have done enough of that.) My only desire is to point out that the best writing in all genres makes the reader anxious for the end. This author uses such derisive, negative and dismissive language from the first line of the introduction that the fun of reading is just not there. Subtlety is the mother of good writing.    
 This book is so lame... I regret every minute I spent reading it.  
 I have a DCS-900W camera that failed within a year. After that, I made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced. Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that don't seem to care about the "service" that much, and usually after a couple of transfers, the line got cut off or picked up by another layman. During conversation, the line quality is very bad.  After a while, I just decided that $100 camera is not worth the time of the calls. I am in the process of reporting their practice to the better business bureau.  Based on my experience, I would be reluctant to buy any expensive things from D-Link. Once you have any problem, they just won't honor the waranty 
 I love the idea of remastering the DBZ seasons and releasing them on DVDs. The drawings are definitely better, and making the episodes uncut is a sweet idea. I used to watch the show frequently when cartoon showed them on a regular basis, and I bought this set hoping to relive those days somewhat.  I bought this set with high hopes that those complaining about the cropping were being too nit-picky. Unfortunately after viewing a few of the episodes I can see that they are 100% in the right. It is sometimes excruciating to watch as the camera zooms in and cuts off the heads of some important characters. This show was definitely made in the full-screen format, and should probably be kept that way.  If that was my only reservation I wouldn't be writing this review, but there are two other things that irk me. The first is the drawn out intros and theme music that funimation put at the beginning of each episode. They took out the sweet guitar theme that Americans know and love and replaced it with the cheesy music the Japanese versions used. Furthermore, they replaced the short intros with drawn out ones that are annoying to sit through by the 4th or 5th disc.  Finally, the voice acting is horrendous. Plain and simple. I used to think the DBZ episodes from the cartoon network were kinda bad, but this makes me appreciate those episodes dearly. The voices from this release sound as if Funimation ran out of money and hired one guy to do the voices for every character. Vegeta's and Goku's are exceptionally bad. I wish I could put sound clips to prove my point, but Amazon won't let me.  This season left a bitter taste in my mouth, and I will certainly not be buying any of the other releases. Instead I will dl the old episodes; sure they are edited and the drawings aren't retouched, but it certainly beats sitting through the horrible music, cropped scenes and horrendous voice acting. 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 This "toy" is the biggest waste of money! When I got it, there were few reviews out about it.  It is very complicated to use and the web site never works and there is nothing to do on it when it does.  They should be repaying all of us our money for having bought this! Don't waste your money 
 DO NOT rely on this book to pass the exam. It lightly touches most of the important subjects, but goes nowhere near deep enough to be useful. I agree is it better written that the BCSI book, but it needs to be much more thourough in its handling of the subject matter. Very poor considering its Cisco 
 It's obvious that most Neil Young fans are thrilled with him no matter what sort of dreck he comes up with.  But speaking as a long-time (since Buffalo Springfield days; I saw the first CSNY concert) fan myself, I have to say that this one just doesn't cut it. I saw Young in concert not long before this album came out, and he performed many of the songs.  These versions are poorly performed and sloppily produced.  And the album has no real point of view; despite the efforts to portray it as having an anti-drug message, it also contains such pro-drug gems as "Roll Another Number for the Road."   Young deserves credit for his ambitious musical reach, but this one, which was well within his territory, thoroughly exceeded his graasp 
 Dear Film Company Jackasses,  Surely you know we already hate you for your greed - Why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like "The Great Santini" and cutting them to Full Screen?  Yet another fine film marred, no doubt, by some big company's desire to cut corners. Burn, Hollywood, burn 
 This book had a good message, and could have had a lasting impact on me. But the plot was obscenely dull, and the middle of the book (Gene and Finny relationship) does not seem to fit in with the rest of the book. Not recommended 
 inconsequential jargon  This pseudo-philosophical work is long, insubstantial and boring. The author tries to hide his sterility by avoiding the very basic and fundamental social and human problem, the problem of universal injustice. One wonders why on earth someone should attempt such a work! The title itself betrays the author's philosophical incompetence: "A Theory of Justice." Hasn't he read Plato? Doesn't he realize that justice is not a theory, but in fact practice? What on earth is a theory of justice, which cannot be put to practice? Right at the beginning of his book Rawls insists on a "veil of ignorance" in order to have fairness to start with.; that is plunging into a book, which has nothing give, which can do nothing to change the world we live in. We are not blind. We know too well that there can be no justice in a society whose members are not blind and deaf, and know too well that there are differences separating individuals. How can anyone insist on capitalism, annual growth and availability of goods for all when the world is limited and the earth with its limited natural resources cannot sustain unchecked human growth? And what is more, he can never define what good are, which must be available to everyone. Is raw materialism justice? Are we chickens in a coop, absolutely predictable? The author should have examined the history of philosophy a little more carefully, which is nothing other than a series of failures in putting the cart before the horse, that is theory before practice.  Haven't we learned the lesson from communism and its disastrous results? Marxism too was an elaborate theory, but in reality turned out to be a gross injustice to all. Is the unquestioned democracy the final truth? Before embarking on another long, empty and pretentious "theory" without foundation a thinker should make him/herself well acquainted with human nature. It is too bad that this jargon is often taught at colleges and universities, forcing nave students read this book, discuss it, and even worse, write term-papers on it. For those who wish to have a clear-cut understanding of social problems and a sound theory of justice I recommend Plato's Republic.  Academic jargon is not philosophy. 
 I purchased this book and attempted to use it as a resource for a trip to Cambodia in July 1999. The only current information in the entire country section was that Pol Pot has died. Cambodia is a fascinating place to visit...Too much has changed for this book to be of any us 
 	I didn't really like this book because it was long and drawn out and it wasn't appealing to me at all! 	Matty was a very bad kid when he first moved to the village. Over the next few weeks he became well behaved and moved in with a blind man named Seer. His daughter Kira and Matty became good friends. Kira lived far through the woods. The village members decided to make a rule that from now on people who want to join the village can't. Seer wanted his daughter to come live with them so he sent Matty through the woods to find her and bring her home. During his journey, Matty came into battles with the forest. When he got to Kira's house he was very happy to see her again. Before he could ask her to come home with him she told him to rest and tell her in the mourning. When he finally got to tell her she answered quickly. She hadn't seen her father in years. On their way back Matty noticed that the forest was fiercer than before. Trying to overcome his battle, he sadly lost and died right then and there. Kira  made it home to live with her father forever. 	I recommend this book to anyone that is a teenager or above because this book is very long and very hard to understand. I am 13 and a strong reader and I had trouble reading it.  
 There is nothing new in this disappointing book.  If one had never read a book on New Age topics it is a good book but if you are looking for something new you won't find it here 
  Sylvia Browne claims to be of God and to have gone to the other side or Heaven but there are many things she says in her book that just don't make since.She says when she went to the other side she saw everyone worshipping together(Jews,Hindus,Buddas,Catholics,Muslims,etc.)Do you really think that in Heaven everyone will be worshipping other gods?She also says that instead of sex there will be merging where you experience the other person's feelings(joy,sorrow,etc.)and you will experience the ultimate bliss.In the book of Revelation it says God will take away all the tears from their eyes and there shall be no more sorrow or pain for the former things have passed away.Also if a person experiences the highest form of bliss by merging, it would seem they would want to be merging all of the time.The highest form of bliss you can and want to achieve is being in the presence of God in Heaven.She also says everyone one the other side has an imperfection(her spirit guide has a chipped tooth).Paul says we will all be in Heaven in our perfect spiritual bodies 
 "1066 and all that..." being the stock British phrase for the Norman Conquest, this book should have been titled "All That."  You slog through so much extraneous, badly organized material (including Saxon and Scandinavian names)that it makes the stereotypical Russian novel look like a model of clarity.  Up to about page 100 there's the occasional paragraph pointing out which way we're going and after that, golly, sometimes a whole page or two of clear storyline. There's actually some interesting stuff but 11th century history and politics were a mess and this book doesn't do much to clear things up 
 Lots and lots and lots of, often meaningless, opinion, but little substantive evidence to support the topic at hand.  Very sloppy translation (original German terms translated two, sometimes three, different ways).  A better choice regarding the "Ideology of Art" in the Third Reich is Frederick Spotts' Hitler & the Power of Aesthetics 
 Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time 
 I think this book releases women into bondage. It doesn't set people free to pursue God. Nor does it set people free to bask in His love. We have created a sub-culture of prejudice, picky, insecure single Christians who are complacent in the name of waiting on the Lord. I feel like this book has been a breeding ground for Christian men to have their cake and eat it too.  While it teaches women to subserviently let guys walk all over them.   This book teaches little on self-respect, being secure in Christ,intimacy with the Father, or being a strong woman. Ladies, you are the pearl of great price. Any man who isn't willing to give EVERYTHING up to be with you, isn't worth it.I feel like this book is a misrepresentation of Christ's passion and purity towards us.  This book is far from passionate. The ultimate passion and love anyone can ever have for anyone,is when they lay down their lives for a friend--- Jim was selfish and reluctant. Not only did He kiss other girls, he wasn't attracted to her. I feel like he had little interest in Elisabeth.  Personally, I think he played games. Ruth's Boaz, on the other hand, sought out her protection, provision, and well-being. He inquired of her and took notice of her compassionate works. Passion is full of faith, adventure, and risk-- Jim lacked those characteristics towards Elisabeth.  Purity is not just abstaining from sexual immorality. Purity is abstaining from selfishness and seeking someone else's well-being above your own. Purity has the best intentions. It isn't picky, it isn't prejudice, it isn't insecure.  I think sometimes, we are guilty of treating marriage or relationships like a scooby snack. If you're a good girl and you follow steps A-Z without wavering, you will have some 100% perfect guy tossed your way. However, that is the furthest thing from the truth.  Husbands aren't due to merit, they come in the Lord's timing. They also come from a willingness to follow your heart.   Personally, even though I commend Elisabeth on her willingness to love in the midst of adveristy and to hope in all things.I don't want my love story to be anything like Jim and Elisabeth's love story nor do I see how she let Christ control her relationship. I feel like she was governed by a plethora of religious balogne. It lacked passion and it lacked the purest intentions. I would not recommend this book. 
  In the unpaginated `Preface [to the] 1973 Edition', Margaret Mead stresses that her description of Samoan moeurs should be read as applying to conditions at the time of her research.  She finds it needful to `shout' that advice because during her 1971 brief visit to Samoa, `young critics even asked me when am I going to revise this book and look unbelieving and angry when I say that to revise it is impossible'.    This is a reference to an abrasive session with students who told her that her description of fa'aSamoa (Samoan custom) was false and insulting.  They were miffed by her styling Samoans `primitives' and her pronouncement that since anthropologists enjoy an `immense superiority', they can `master the fundamental structure' [of primitive society] . . . `in a few months' (p. 8).  In keeping with this arrogance, Samoans attending university were told by their instructors that their experience of fa'aSamoa was not valid evidence against Mead's scientific study.  And, as we've just seen, Mead refused to revise her book even when she knew that it is mistaken in many particulars.    For Samoans this patronizing manner was the familiar voice of the papalagi (the colonial power).  Mead's hosts on her field trip, aware that she enjoyed the protection of the Pacific Fleet admiral and Boss of American Samoa, went to great lengths to provide reliable information.  When they learned of what they call her luma fai tele (`shameless defamaton'), they could not comprehend how she could have betrayed their hospitality.  They were also aggrieved that she deceived them about her marital status.  For she accepted the title taupou (ceremonial virgin) although as a married woman she was ineligible.  Then she disgraced the title by carrying on with Aviata, a young man regarded as a rake.    While Samoans long knew the mendacity of this book, its correction in academic circles commenced only with the 1983 publication of Derek Freeman's Margaret Mead and Samoa: The Making and Unmaking of an Anthropological Myth (Harvard University Press).  That event shook anthropology to its boots.  Such was Mead's prestige that the popular mind identified her with anthropology.  If her credibility was seriously questioned in respect to the most widely believed anthropological study ever published, the credibility of the profession was at risk.  That is why Freeman was attacked with great ferocity, even by those who agreed with his critique.  Freeman's book initiated a reappraisal of Coming of Age in Samoa.  Martin Orans and Freeman have recently published studies of her Samoa investigations based on her field notes.  They confirm that Mead's account of Samoan sexual moeurs is a travesty.  But they go beyond that.  Mead recorded the accounts given by her informants, but by ignoring key facts, twisting others, and inventing still others, she contrived to represent Samoa as a free love duck pond.  She also misrepresented the research she carried out.  She was funded to conduct a study of adolescent girls; and she states that she spent `six months accumulating an intimate and detailed knowledge of all adolescent girls in the community'.  Her field notes tell otherwise. She devoted her time to assembling ethnography; the funded study never got off the ground.  She states that she conducted `all' her interviews with these girls in the Samoan language (`I spoke their language and ate their food').  Orans found however that her information on adolescent girls came from `English-speaking informants using English to communicate'.  He notes that `no conversations in Samoan are recorded in any of the field materials'.  This is consistent with Freeman's finding that the study of adolescent girls was not conducted at all.    Mead built her picture of free love by tossing off unsupported one-liners.  The `inept lover is a laughing stock'.  There are `no neurotic pictures, no frigidity' in Samoa.  Masturbation `is a universal habit'.  Homosexual activity is `very prevalent' and is regarded as `simply play'.  `[Samoan] girls' minds were perplexed by no conflicts . . . [to have as] many lovers as possible and then to marry . . . these were uniform and satisfying ambitions'.  The field materials do not show that Mead collected any evidence whatever about masturbation, homosexuality, or incidence of neuroticism and frigidity.  She had but one informant about intimate sexual moeurs--an eighteen year old school teacher.  In 1981 that person told Freeman that he had an affair with Margaret.  Thus Samoa's alleged free love amounts to no more than a loose wife's gullibility to the pillow talk of her teenage lover.  Such is the `science' that made this book famous.  Research on Mead's field notes clarifies a feature of this book that has puzzled many readers.  It is the drastic and repeated inconsistency between Mead's descriptions of Samoan vigilance of virginity and punishments of straying girls, and the attribution of a casual attitude toward sexuality.  What we now can see is that Mead patched her free love pillow talk into descriptions given to her by her adult informants.    How is that anthropologists for so long were taken in by a popular book?  One part of the answer is that many weren't taken in.  The controversy brought to light numerous statements to this effect.  Thus Weston LaBarre wrote: "When I was a graduate student in anthropology at Yale in the late '30's, Mead's Sex and Temperament came out.  Puzzled that even a big island like New Guinea should have had three tribes waiting to be discovered to prove her point about the non-biological nature of gender, I went to Edward Sapir with my puzzlement.  He said laconically, `She's a pathological liar'.  I was startled as much by what he said, as by the fact that an eminent anthropologist and chairman of a department should say this to a mere graduate student.  But over the years, I have come to believe that this is literally the case."  The next round in the evaluation of Mead's anthropology, we may hope, will collect and critically assess this largely unpublished expert opinion.

 As a work of fiction this is a fine book. Mailer is a great writer and as I don't think this was one of his finest works, it was still an enjoyable read. What I was a bit irked by was the lack of focus on what I thought was going to be the central plot of the novel - Adolf Hitler's childhood. This was a book about his father Alois mostly. It detailed Alois' childhood, relationships, work, children, retirement and death. As soon as he died there was 20 pages left in the book. Yes, you can say that we can gain some sort of insight into Adolf's life indirectly by seeing what a person his father was but this is not very complete. My expectation was that you would see sections of his father throughout his life, sections of his school friends, deep traumatic experiences and what inevitably started him down the road of politics. The ending of this book left me feeling very incomplete, almost as if there was a second volume somewhere that I forgot to purchase 
 This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection.  I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets!  There, you can continue shopping 
 Until I read culture clash I thought this book was probably mostly ok, if not someone superstitious. Since then I have realized that this book is more dangerous then good. The ideas in this book are mostly baseless, the methods in this book may "work", but they are definitely not the best, and can be very damaging do some breeds.  Please, if looking to buy a book, get culture clash first, then get this. You will then realize what I'm talking about 
 I actually read this entire book just to see if/how Beatrice would get what was coming to her. Yes, the book is about incest. The ads and cover I've seen for this book state something like "Murder, Incest, Betrayal" or something like that so it should come as no shock that it is about incest. The thing I didn't like was that about 2/3 of the book seemed to be about nothing but sex. Sex scene after sex scene. I frankly belive it's better to leave it to the imagination. We all know what happens when you have sex. But really it seemed more wrong that Beatrice and her brother acted like a couple in love. It wasn't just the incest that was gross. Gregory's descriptions of other physical things left me queasy at times. After everything, I think what Beatrice did to her husband had to be one of the vilest acts I've ever read. This book was at the most okay and I do not recommend it 
 The word "Science" has no place on the cover of this irritating, utterly biased piece of fluff.  Believers and disbelievers alike will find no substantive information on the subject.  What you will find are Roach's endless ramblings and anecdotes leading to no conclusion.  Roach comes off sounding like a bad comedienne, spending her time meandering about here and there seeking out people that she can ridicule rather following any real research methods.  Her overuse of "amusing" footnotes does nothing for her already weak manuscript.  This is not to say that Roach does not have some talent as a writer.  But her skills might be put to better use writing political satire or humorous essays.  As someone who has done a fair amount of research on this subject, I found this book offensive in it's frivolity.   If you are looking for a thought-provoking look at the subject of the afterlife, you will be very dissapointed.  In short: don't waste your money or time 
 Using the borrowed style of Ann Coulter (who he thinks is witty and smart and funny), Bernie has written a clunker. Let's not mistake this book for anything less than what it is - a smear book. The kind Bill O'Reilly was rallying against when written by a lefty, but brings the author on to rave about when written by a conservative. Here - the title makes it seem like he will have an honest debate. Instead it is all about the left, and how the right will not take it anymore.  The targets are the usual suspects, but the main target no longer is Michael Moore (your remember the 100 people screwing up America book where all but a handful were liberals - and included television hosts of info-mercials!), but is Rosie O'Donnell. Somewhere along the lines, she became public enemy number one. There is nothing new in this book that you cannot read online, or hear on any conservative radio program. You know the drill. 1) There is a liberal bias in the media. 2) Rosie and others work for the Democratic party. 3) Liberals get together and go over talking points (must be since they cannot have a thought of their own according to Bernie). 4) We hate Rush because he is successful. It has nothing to do with him being a racist, sexist, or overall piece of trash drug user. I read these books, and usually my blood boils. This one could not get any reaction like that. Take it for what it is - a political book that tries to be funny, and fails. 
 The different authors write different chapters defining some things differently.    The material is outdated, you'll constantly have to update their junk to make it work.  Way too verbose and bouncing back and forth within an individual chapter (just try those two early BMP/CMP chapters).  It's just not worth $1.  Use the sun tutorials for a much better and much much clearer start.  
 This film is based on a concept that has potential - a mathematical key to the interconnectedness of all things - but it doesn't deliver.  Clearly, the writer wants us to believe that there is one elusive key to the intriguing patterns all around us, but he pretty much drops the ball right there.  Usually with this sort of plot, you are at least given the illusion that *someone* knows the answer and what's more has some clue about what to do with it as well.  There's no such suspension of disbelief in this one, nor even an attempt at such.    Adding injury (if you count eye strain) to insult, the whole thing is shot in grainy B&W with annoying MTV-style jump cuts.  In the awards for Obnoxious Splash Films of the Year, this one takes the cake, but not the Pi 
 Really not as good as I expected from some of the reviews posted. I take a lot of scripts (at least 4 different ones daily) and a lot of supplements (in the dozen range) too, but I did not find it easy to cross check in this book.  I would not recommend it very highly.. 
 The nautical setting is interesting: Recognizable to those familiar with sailing, a learning experience for those of us who are not. One star.  The characters are interesting: Ranging from hardend sailors with strong work ethics to unpricipled slackers, with a mysterious black shipmate (who may or may not be faking illness) thrown in to shake them all up. One star.  What I didn't find interesting was Conrad's writing style. His descriptions contained far too many confusing similes, his run-on sentences and three-page paragraphs were tiresome, and his sudden switch from third-person to first-person narration was a bit bewildering. No stars 
 Lamer Daddy = Lamer Band. VDH thinks invading Iraq was a good thing, even though is was not a direct threat to the US. VDH thinks invading 'Mexicans' want to over run the US, even though much of the land was stolen by the US from the aboriginal population. Me thinks VDH is a hypocrite 
 If you like the Dirk Pitt series & the Kurt Austin series, don't bother reading this book! The action is NOT there, nor is the intrigue that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series.  This book was not as 'action-packed' as the two other series, and left me wishing the book to be over.  I had to 'make' myself finish the book, and even then, my only comment was "That's it?!" It's definitely NOT the 'page-turner' type story that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. And, to be honest, I miss the 'cameo' appearances of the author in the Pitt novels 
 There is a revised, updated version of this text (that is less expensive) - and if you order this one, Amazon will ship it to you, charge you for it and not refund the sale.  They claim that its not their fault that they'll ship you an outdated edition.  Check the publication date and get the updated softcover edition 
 This is just a piece of ***  Hollywood has shown here that they just have no new ideas/stories so they continue to try and use special effects and a bad scriptwriters to remake what was and still is one of the best movies ever.  This is not the first Hollywood remake that is garbage and will not be the last but as long as there are people willing to part with good money to watch movies it won't change.   This is a good reason why Blockbuster have lost sales recently - nothing worth watchin 
 "Are you going to work with Eddie Murphy again?" Asked to John Landis by someone at the 1992 Fangoria Convention. "I hope not," Landis replied. Now keep in mind this was in reference to them working together in "Coming to America," not this film. I have no idea why they teamed up together again, because the evidence from this film shows they must have really disliked one another even more. Look at this film and then look at "Trading Places," their first collaboration and you can begin to see the differences. I thought with this third "Beverly Hills Cop," Landis was going to support the story adaquately, then for the action scenes show his wild spirit (ala the ending sequences of "Animal House," "American Werewolf," and "Blues Brothers"), and for the comedy, roll two to three cameras and let Eddie play with each scene. If Landis could give Michael Jackson room to do what he wanted in the "Black or White" video, why not let Eddie do what he does best instead of forcing his character and us the audience through a bunch of painfully unfunny scenes, terrible acting, and a tv movie look? Sure it looks better on dvd than it did in the theatres, but that is still no excuse for betraying the core of this series. If it had tried to do something different and been successful, this film would be liked much more. The reason why it is so hated is because the film has no pulse or soul--something I never thought possible for John Landis or Eddie Murphy. Both men are capable of great things but lord have mercy on this film and give everyone their two hours back 
 In answer to a music fan from Temple Hills, the song was called King Holiday by the King Dream Chorus & Holiday Crew. It came out on Mercury in 1986 and featured the singers and rappers you mentioned. It made no.30 on the R&B Charts but didn't crossover pop. The lyrics are on the net (try Google) but I don't know if the song still is 
 MY HUSBAND AND I WERE ALL SET TO BUY THIS FOR CHRISTMAS FOR OUR 2 BOYS BUT I READ THE REVIEWS AND I KNOW I WOULD NOT BUY IT UNLESS THE ENTIRE COLLECTION WAS OFFERED. HURRY, DISNEY, AND RELEASE ALL EPISODES IN ONE SET!!!!!!! 
 I bought this in a haze of holiday optimism, having heard Ms. Aguilera knock my socks off dueting with Tony Bennett on a television tribute show.  There is no denying that the girl can sing.  Unfortunately, what she sings here is banal at best, and downright irritating at worst--lots of gratuitous squealing.  It's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity.  I reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age.  Maybe I just don't get it.  Then again, maybe it's just not there for me to get 
 The 25 minutes of Bing and Frank is good, not their best but good.  The disk case states 90 minute running time and the Amazon site gives running time as 60 minutes.  If you enjoy the majority of the disk being "bonus" materail it's fine.  I feel it's a rip off 
 This book is just a lame, and very christian book of anecdotes by a Tennessean who hopes to do lectures and sell books.  It has absolutely nothing to do with John Grogan (the columnists) absolutely brilliant book, Marley and Me ...  I really wish Amazon would not relate the two books ...  I am planning to return this tomorrow ...   This book is going to be returned tomorrow .. I found it awful and in many places distasteful.  Read Marley and Me and not the other work by this other John Grogan.  Thank you.  
 In my part of Virginia NASCAR is as common as Peanut Butter in a grocery store.  Everywhere you go, you are going to see it.  It is either on cars, on shirts, on billboards, or anywhere else that your eyes may wonder.  Most of the material still pays respect to the number "3" and the driver that will forever be missed.  It pulls people to the track to see that number and thankfully everyone can profit off the commercial success of this driver's death.  Sadly, ESPN also did this and the result was the ill-fated made-for-TV-movie, 3: The Dale Earnhardt Story starring the "I need work bad" actor, Berry Pepper.  Literally racing through the life of this legend, this film boasts a simple 88 minutes and vaguely covers whatever it can to give rabid fans just a taste of this man's life.  Instead of giving him the proper respect, ESPN uses clichés and over-bearing family moments that just scream "made-for-TV".  With Pepper's accent fading in and out within races, you cannot help but laugh at this cheaply designed model created by director Russell Mulcahy.       So, what went wrong with this film?  Since the word "everything" will not cover all of it, I will attempt to explain in some detail.  I cannot stress this fact enough that if an actor looks like the person that you are trying to portray, it does not mean that he or she will do a good job (see the Charlize Theron theory).  This goes for Barry Pepper, who just never really gave Earnhardt any personality.  I felt like I was watching the story of one of those paper cutout dolls.  Sure, his costumes and appearance would change, but nothing else would.  His motions and emotions were forced and never really felt like I was watching the life of NASCAR's greatest, but instead seeing an actor do an impersonation of someone that he admires.  Pepper would not have Executive Produced this film if he wasn't already an Earnhardt fan (or at least could see the $$ made from the death of a human).  The same could be said about the rest of the actors in this film.  The children felt and sounded like paper mache, never quite seeming that comfortable in front of the camera ... especially Dale Jr.  I felt as if a gust of wind could have made him cry.  In fact, all the performances in this film coupled with a gust of wind made me cry.  As I mentioned earlier, the timing on this film seemed very off.  How can you successfully measure the power of a man in a short span of 88 minutes?  There is just no way that you are going to be able to cover the depth and emotional excitement in this short time.  So, the creative team behind this film chose to ignore these moments and extend the racing scenes.  The outcome was literally horrible.  There was no balance, there was no craft, there was nothing actually paying respect to this man.  The story is where I could see the minds of the cash hungry people just getting bigger and bigger because they were going to do a story about a man life that millions would want to see.  They would want to see it not because it was good, but because the Earnhardt name was solely attached to it.  For a non-NASCAR fan like myself, this was kind of sad.  How can you have the life of Howard Hughes pushing three hours, and NASCAR powerhouse Dale Earnhardt just 88 minutes?  I guess you can over compensate by giving the viewers some extra features to the DVD, but for me that just didn't work.  The story was sloppy and completely disgraced Earnhardt's name.  Overall, this proved to me that if you give a bunch of rednecks a camera, this is the quality of work that they will produce.  This was one of the worst autobiographical stories that I have seen in a very long time, even for the likes of "made for TV" it was horrible.  There was nothing redeemable in this story that I could go back to friends or family and say, "Well, this part was kinda neat".  There was nothing of the sort here.  I walked away from the film with less of an understanding about Earnhardt and his NASCAR business.  Even if you are a huge NASCAR fan, I do not think you will see the value in this film.  I especially love reading other reviews that say that this was a great film, but lacked some major elements to Dale's life.  Isn't that like a double negative?  Good film, but somehow you forgot to mention this?  I think some are just too generous with this story.  I am sad that he died, but this is not the way to pay respect to the man's life.  Grade: * out of **** 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 I plodded through to the end of this book, hoping that Mr. Head's writing style and depiction of the world would break out of the simplistic.  I was disappointed.  The world and the motivations of the humans that live in it, both in positions of power and among the common folk, are much, much more complex than in this book.  The only redeeming quality of the book is as the basis to some hypothetical wargame scenarios (say for Harpoon 4).  Otherwise, you won't lose anything by not reading it.  You're better off buying a good history book for the money 
 I was going to buy this book because it was so highly recommended by Dr. Phil among others. When I checked the reviews at amazon books I decided it would be safer to check it out at my local library and I have to say THANKS FOR THE WARNING. This book was so bad I wanted to throw up. Who would raise their kids like this. Why would you want to make food a control issue and teach your kids animals are disposable. Whats up with the spanking. Why would you beat your own kids! Honestly, it might work but so would hitting them over the head with a 2X4. We are their parents, surely we can do better than that! 
 Hoo boy ... The author appears to have very little knowledge of BtVS, which would be acceptable if he offered an exciting plot or good writing, which he does not. I like the idea of druids running around Sunnydale, but nothing really happens to justify their presence. Give it a miss 
 Well you certainly will be able to recognize words and answer the questions correctly, but if you're expecting to understand what the words actually mean...I wouldn't recommend this. I was able to answer the first seven chapters easily and get all questions right but I have no idea what any words in the sentence/caption actually mean.   I've used it for a month know and I have no greater knowledge of Chinese than when I started....  
 I bought this (luckily, used) based on the excellent reader reviews I read here on Amazon.  I could not have been more misled.  This is one of the worst self-improvement books I have ever read. It is bad beyond anything I could have expected, so bad that had I not gotten my hopes up for a good read with some good advice, I probably would have fallen out of my recliner laughing.  This book is a very thin gruel of other writers' ideas, dumbed down for the sort of reader who finds literary satisfaction in  romance novels. The substance of this book is nothing more than "If you write down what you want--and keep writing it down, if necessary--you'll get it."  Hmmm.    "Hmmm" is right.    Hardly anyone these days isn't familiar with the earlier New Age incarnation of this idea--writing affirmations--and anyone who has read the writings of the Founding Fathers of motivational self-improvement (like Napoleon Hill) has seen it as well.  Far, far too much of this book consists of anecdotes.  The anecdotes range in their effect from soporific to nauseating.  Take "Gloria's" story, for example.  An entire chapter is devoted to Gloria's search for love, for a husband.  She writes letters to a "soul mate" that she has not yet met.  Among her puerile love-maunderings, she writes a description of the soul mate she hopes to meet:  He is a "beautiful" dresser, and has "Strong hands, deep integrity, and spiritual truth," and a gift for "making and having money." She doesn't want the money because she's high maintenance and loves to spend; no, she wants the money "for the joy, love, peace, and bounty it can bring the world."  (Uh, yeah, sure Gloria.  Clearly you're one of those unfortuate individuals who believes her own bs.)  After two years of writing this sort of pabulum to herself, Gloria goes to a bar, gets picked up by a lawyer, and marries him 11 months later. As we all know, lawyers typically possess exactly the sorts of qualities she was looking for in a soul mate, so this outcome is hardly surprising....  The book doesn't get any better than this, and there is even a short chapter at the end of the book to help you rationalize the failure of the techniques (for lack of a better word) described between the interminable anecdotes.    Most importantly, the advice simply doesn't work.  This book really is a silly piece of nonsense.  Skip it. 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
 This book focuses on the AB-specific part of AP test. It starts with a good idea as a beginner's book by having lab sessions and exercises. But the book does not clearly explain concepts and in general lacks of examples, some lab session descriptions are confusing, and some exercises are more suitable with different solutions rather than the data structures it suggests. A better approach is to go with a good "regular" Java data structures book, such as the one by  Rober Lafore. These books target a broader readers and do a much better job in presenting data structures in Java. To use these regular data structure books specifically for AB exam, one could just skip the non-AB parts of content. 
 Very poorly written, I couldn't get past page 50 or so.   For example, in opening pages each paragraph uses the word "superhuman" to describe space marines.  Action sequences are similarly redundant.  Nothing comes to life in this book.  Re-read the Warhammer rulebooks, they're  better written and far more entertaining 
 This set of 566 cards follows on the first set of 440 cards.  I find it highly inappropriate for cards targeted at someone who has studied at least 400 Kanji to use Romaji.  Romaji distracts experienced students, misleads beginner students, and serves no real purpose once you have studied the basic forty or so set of Hiragana.  I returned these cards after a week because of the Romaji 
 I was very disappointed that this cookbook didn't have more comfort food recipes.  It used ingredients that you wouldn't normally have on hand.  I was looking for recipes for meatloaf, mac & cheese.  I won't buy another cookbook that I can't review first 
 Amazon should let us give 0 stars too :D  I paid $43 for it brand new from a place that will accept returns. I'm returning it.   It is the only USB device I have ever had that keeps falling asleep (the usb green led keeps going out, and I have no midi signal). I'm using it in Windows 2000. Like I said... it is the only usb device I have ever had that will not stay alive like it should. When it falls asleep, I have to do the Windows "unplug or eject hardware" thing then unplug the Uno's usb cable and replug it. That wakes it up, but I never know if it will stay awake for 30 seconds or 2 hours.  One thing to know about spending money on an item designed this way: if you accidentally damage any of these cables attached to this blue circuit box, you lose the whole device. These cables cannot be unplugged, repaired or replaced. Get a box where every cable can be unplugged instead 
 Clearly this book was written to shock and disgust the reader.  It largely succeeeds.   The overriding weakness of the book is that all the characters basically act, sound and view life in the same way. After reading a couple dozen pages I noiticed that you could simply insert the name of one male charater into the place of another and not really notice any difference.   All the men are ignorant, physically abusive and shiftless drunks (of somewhat varying degrees).  (...)  I wonder if this work would have been more interesting if Selby took one of the stories in LEB (...say..."Strike"...) and provided more depth about the character's history and motivations.   This work suffesrs from the same fatal flaw as Richard Wright's "Native Son" (although a much different work): the main character(s) is (are) simply unlikeable and repellant; the reader has no reason to care what happens to them.  
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 Avoid this one. The bad reviews are not kidding. The plot is almost non-existent. The action scenes are not enough to make up for the poor editing. The writing has drawn the characters very thinly. Sadly, a reason to watch this movie is to be amused at how badly it is put together 
 I bought this box set thinking it'd be as great as the first two and I was extremely disappointed... I would have preferred that Rhino just continued with the time period and genre that made up Nuggets 2... I've since sold Children of Nuggets on ebay just to get some of my money back... Don't even bother... Stay with Nuggets 2.. 
 Scale is nice but doesn't include working batteries.  The batteries run out a few days after you get it.  My mistake was not returning it, so I purchased new batteries, at the cost of $10.52.  A little less than what I paid for the scale.  
 I read THE BEANS OF EGYPT, MAINE many years ago because it was gathering such brilliant praise.  It is an appalling book.  It is pornographic, disjointed, depressing and very, very weird.  It reads like the drivel that comes out of women's writing classes which is supposed to be so profound but is mearly the meanderings of a mind steeped in Harlequin trash.  It was written most probably on a filthy kitchen table while a pile of dishes fermented in the sink and a baby sitting in a high chair screamed his head off.    This book is not fit for the compost heap 
 I have been a subscriber for 4 years.  Back in November my account was turned off due to a billing issue. The week prior to it being turned off I started receiving 3 calls a day for payment.  I advised one of the reps to wait a week for the payment, payment was made.  Calls stopped for another week.  The radio was then turned off and the 3 calls a day started up again.  I explained to the bill collectors I owed nothing and when offered to reactivate the radio I told them not to bother, at this point I wanted nothing more to do with XM.  They offered me 3 months of free service to come back, anyone who cancels can get this by the way, and I refused.  The 3 calls a day continued for the next week, I was informed that it simply takes a week for your name to fall out of their automated system....    2 more months go by and then I start receiving a bill saying that I reactivated my radio and owe for 2 months of service and all the late fees that go with that.  40 dollars.  I call in and state I never reactivated my radio, thus I don't owe for reactivating my radio and the 2 months of service that would have followed.  The customer service rep told me that it would be taken cared of, 2 weeks later I get another bill.  I call back and the rep tells me the same thing and apologizes for my inconveniences.  I even called back the next day just to make sure it was finally resolved, and that rep confirmed that I no longer owed anything.  So then last month I start receiving COLLECTIONS NOTICES. YOU HAVE ONE MONTH TO PAY THIS BEFORE IT GOES TO COLLECTIONS.  I called in and was promised they would look into it and call me back.  This apparently has taken care of the issue, though I never received the call back.  This week I called 6 times, 3 of which I was promptly hung up on for no reason, and was told each time that it had been resolved.  So hopefully this time it really is...  To anyone considering XM I suggest you just get an MP3 player 
 The Demon feature on this disc is just okay,,An occasional scare but not much plot, Lots of running around in the dark and lots of nudity,,darn little plot,,and no reason to know anything about the killer,,he is just a BIG sicko much like Halloweens mad killer..no motive just lots of killing,,DUH! I think it is supposed to be set in the USA but everyone was in cars with driver on the right hand side of car..God told me to is also okay,,a shade better perhaps than the demon,,Good Against Evil (whatever ) is a direct Rosemary's Baby rip off,,enough said, 
 I did not care for this book at all. It's just a very repetitive murder mystery. Each issue/chapter is like this: Batman fights a supervillain (who are all presented in the most one-dimensional way possible here), a mobster gets killed, and various other little bits of plot involving fake mob stuff and red herrings that you know won't actually have anything to do with solving the mystery.  Tim Sale appears to be a pretty good artist, although I think some of his character designs are a little ridiculous, even for a comic book (best example: His Joker that has like 800 teeth). Also, I feel there's just nothing about his art that really connects with me, but maybe that's just me.  This book is supposed to be sort of a sequel to Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Batman: Year One, which is much better than this. You should get the deluxe edition of Year One and avoid Long Halloween and its follow-up, Dark Victory. Those two books are some of the few comics/graphic novels I have actually sold after buying them. And I actually felt bad for the person I was selling them to 
 I guess I should have read the reviews better. This book is not Erotic as I thought it should be. [...]. I did of course read every page. These stories are not the sexy, romantic, love you forever type. They are dark and depraved. I of course bought the next book and will update it when I get the stomach to read it. I am at least prepared for this type book 
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya 
 Just like all other DVD media Memorex offers, this is total junk. I can't believe CompUSA would carry such an inferior product. Yes, the discs worked great for about a year. Then the dye totally disintegrates, after only 10 erases and re-writes. As you can you see, the warranty is only a year so I wasted my money. Memorex should state on the package "Discs will only work for year or after 10 re-writes". What a scumbag compan 
 Dreadful. A beautifully written piece of nothing. I suppose there was a story in there somewhere, but the layers of impression and nuance and deliberate disorientation thoroughly destroyed any plot there may have been to begin with. I actually suspect that there was no plot to this novel, if it can even be called such. As prose, 'tis written well. As a novel, however, it blows.  Consoled myself afterwards by reading the far superior The Remains Of The Day again 
 What are all these 5 star reviewers thinking??? Aureolin and rose madder--Dobie's recommended yellow and red primaries, are extremely fugitive--they fade in a short time. Because of this alone, the book should be vigorously rejected as coming from dubious authority.  Her plan for making colors "sing," by the way, involves placing an occassional bright color in a field of grays or browns, mixed not from earth pigments, but from (fugitive) primaries.  It would be irresponsible of me to perpetrate such a book on an unsuspecting public by giving it any stars at all.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't have a "zero" stars option.  If you want a superior book that will show you much better ways to make colors "sing," get "Perfect Color Choices for the Artist," by Michael Wilcox 
 Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this book like I did.  It is a waste.  The book is a compendium of common sense with a cute cover and a high price.  Jane Buckingham's research consists of checking out a few websites (don't believe me?  Read her bibliography in the back of the book).  It's a mornoic book and and top of that, there were several sections that offended me.  Especially when she talks about how "slobby" Ikea furniture is and how she never eats mayonnaise.  Give me a break.  I want advice from a "real" intelligent woman who has worked hard for what she's gotten.  Not some skinny Duke grad trying to get rich off publishing information you can find faster by googling.  I'm embarrassed I bought this one 
 This book is terrible.  RaH takes a perfectly good murder mystery and turns in into...well, I don't quite know what.  Halfway through the book, it seems as though he had set it down for several years, came back to it to finish it off, but had nothing but nonsense on the brain.  I've seen authors pull an ending out of their hat before, but this book absolutely takes the cake.  It's not even my book and I threw it in the trash so it won't waste another person's time ever again 
 I'll be honest -- after reading 50 pages of this book, I got off the StairMaster at the gym, put the book in my bag, and had no interest in reading any more of it. It just wasn't that interesting. It read more like a history of the Bhagwan Rajneesh, and less a story about Guest's childhood experiences. If you want to read about horrifying childhoods or kids in cults, try "Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress" by Susan Jane Gilman or "Running with Scissors" by Augusten Burroughs. Either one is a more entertaining and less laborious to read 
 This is one of the best books I have ever read on the Revolutionary War.  Even though it is technically classified as a novel, it is accurately presented history. Mr. Shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book, and presented the historical events accurately, as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable.  The main participants in the Revolutionary War were presented not as gods, but as truly great and courageous men and women.  He also presented the details of battles, troop movements, condition of troops, and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events.  I have a better understanding of the Revolutionary War years than I have ever had, and would highly recommend this book to every American who would like to have a better understanding of the founding of our wonderful country.  
 I love batman, but this version of batman is by far the worst version ever created (including all the live action, animation, or comic book versions of batman).  I have no clue why they are wasting animation resourses on a crap cartoon like this, when they could be putting it toward quality cartoons like Justice League.  Warner Bros. needs to get a clue.  I might not be a kid anymore (I'm the ripe old age of 21), but if I ever have kids I can promise you they will not be allowed to watch this.  They will be watching all of the Batman the animated series dvds that I bought last month.  Please parents (and kids) go buy those dvds (or superman the animated series, or justice league, or batman beyond, or x-men, or even teen titans) instead of wasting your money on this crapola 
 I usually love the Philosophy brand bath and shower gels, but this was a major disappointment-didn't smell anything like pound cake or lavender for that matter-in fact the odor is quite strong and nauseating. There are other gels that are great but AVOID this one! Phew!! 
 The only great thing about "The Great Fire" is its name.  This is one of those books that as you read it, you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute, the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield, about the dog, that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet, which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been...but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war Japan and the Australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager, or was the chap British...and the she, the bosses wife, who strangely winked at you during the last Christmas party and you felt like choking...he must have been Australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in Australia...but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read...but who really cares whether the Australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other, after all the world really changed since 1947...and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to `Stanley Steamer' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression...But back to the book! If you love British style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps (with names like Bertram and Aldred) get together to have some tea, then in their spare time write long romantic letters, and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2, this is the book for you. If you are like me, meaning you have so much on your mind that it'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages, then I highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 Outdated, Utterly Inept...Bizarre chemical terminology from the 1800's. An entire chapter devoted to 'Papaver' sub-species with NO morphine alkaloid present...Global statistics on poppy cultivation from the 1950's...whatever-that's-for...etc etc etc. Garbage! 
 I don't normally write these reviews, but I feel a responsibility to other readers to warn them away from this book.  If you don't want to know any details about the book, you have the option of not reading this review, but, if you want to know what you're letting yourself in for, read on.  If you are a horse lover, I srongly advise against reading The Horse Whisperer.  If you want a romantic love story, you should also look elsewhere.  If you want insight into dealing with a trauma, so sorry, no luck here.  The book opens with a graphic description of a violent accident involving a girl and her horse, which results in death.  Though I found these scenes truly disturbing, I hoped the trip taken by the girl and her mother to find an expert who could help to heal the girl and her horse would prove redeeming somehow.  Instead, the experience was muddled and pointless.  The few instances involving the "whisperer" attempting to heal the horse from its trauma struck me as something that would further traumatize the poor animal.  Nothing he does ever seems to break through and cause the horse any improvement.  Additionally, the mother appears to have no purpose in the story except wandering aimlessly around the farm, occasionally cheating on her husband with this man, and becoming pregnant with his child.  The book's focus then turns almost completely to this ill-advised affair which doesn't really have any chemistry to it.  The man and the mother don't seem that attracted to each other, and evidently only end up together because the plot required it of them.  During all this, the girl's psychological problems resulting from the accident are basically ignored.  She pretty much drops out of sight until the very close of the book when she is taken by the horse whisperer to witness another graphically brutal occurrence, which ends in another horrific death.  Apparently, what we are to glean from this book is that, if you are a woman who can't have children with your husband, getting knocked up by another man will save your marriage.  If you are a young girl who happens to witness a violent death, nothing will cure you except witnessing another violent death.  If you're a horse, you can just figure things out for yourself.  The fact that everyone seems blissfully happy after all this absurdity, just feels as though the author got bored with what he was writing and figured he had to wrap it up with a Hollywood ending somehow so he could get it off to the publisher quickly.  In the end, I see no reason to waste your time with this book.  I wish I could get back the hours of my life I spent on it.      
 It looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily. The shipping was fast and the price was right 
 This is the longest textbook I have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that. I know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations, but the book was too detailed and wordy for me. Many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding. But this book doesn't do that. It is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise, straightforward text. A really good book is Investment Science, by David Luenberger. Although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory, the writing, examples, and organization is far superior. You'll actually begin to understand how investment really works, without getting bogged down by the numbers, terminology, and jargon 
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
 Easily the worst textbook I encountered during my undergraduate years.  Unfocused, sparse, and almost completely lacking example problems.  Riggs touches briefly on lots of topics and treats none of them completely, leaving the reader lacking any notion of how process control actually works in real life.  I'm not a big fan of the book by Seborg et al. either, but if you have to choose between the two, go with Seborg 
 this book is useless. after finish the whole book, you will know nothing about CG or Maya. The book comes with Maya Personal Edition software which is useful, but soon will be available free from maya website 
 I had to buy this book for one of my upper divison Lit. Theory classes and the price I paid for it balanced against the number of texts out of it we had to read isn't worth it.  You can save yourself a lot of money and actually do yourself some good by just buying all the book in this anthology and keeping them for future reference.  Price, however, isn't my largest complaint with this book; the fact that it doesn't have ONE complete text and gives you only bits and pieces doesn't clue you in to other important aspects of these philosophers!  If you have to buy this book be forewarned that it's a waste of money and will be of no use to you to save for the future.  The only good thing about it is it at least gives you a PREVIEW of important works of continental philosoph 
 If you are looking for love, romance, witty banter and everything else that has made Suzanne Brockmann a hit....don't expect it from this book!!  The romance is undeveloped, sparse and stale.  The suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt.  A great read if you're looking for nightmares.  
 In all honesty, this book was severely lacking in just about every area. It wasn't horrible. I didn't mind reading it, but there were just so many problems with the story as a whole, so many poorly developed aspects that kept it from being a truly good read. The story was very two-dimensional, lacking development and depth. It was just very superficial.  The characters have very little depth or exploration. The authors give you some basic history, but fail to really explore them. They mention things but then never really tell you about them. An example is Maggie's pregnancy. You know that the antagonist got her pregnant at a young age, and you're told that there was some sort of cover-up to get her out of town so no one would know. But they never give you any details. You have no idea exactly how old she was, and you're not told anything at all about this cover-up. Where did she go? What did she do? How did she handle it all? Why did she make up a husband? It would have been nice to have these details and it would have given another dimension to Maggie's character.  Zack's was in a similar state. You know his FBI step-father was killed by the antagonist but you learn little else, other than that Zack was greatly affected by the slaying. I wanted to know how old Zack was when his mother married his step-father, what their relationship was like, how he dealt with the man's death, etc. Again, knowing all this would have made the character more full-bodied. The authors just failed to give these characters any depth at all.  The romance between them was poorly developed as well. It seemed extremely forced, with very little emotion involved. It was like, hey, let's kiss; hey, let's have sex; hey, I think I might have feelings for you. I wasn't feeling the chemistry between them at all. I had a really hard time believing that these two characters were in love.  There were also some minor areas where issues bothered me. One was that Zack, as an FBI Agent, was allowed to participate in the case at all. He was personally connected (his father being killed by the antagonist 14 years earlier). I had a hard time buying that that would be allowed. Also, Destiny, who had roles in the other books, is done a serious injustice in this book. She's paired off and engaged with hardly a whisper. A little more on that would have been nice.  As for the good points...well, I enjoyed the cameos of Max and Jamie. Fleas the hound dog and Butterbean the goat were great. And the actual plot wasn't too bad. But none of that could overcome the holes in the book. I was rather disappointed overall once I finished.  Rating: 2 / 5 
 this DJ plays music that I can hear in a bus, in the subway or even in the slumberest parties! I just hate that he and his music is the most comercial in the entire planet earth. Come on boys, put some bad reviews, was not helpful? your so not into this kind of music, that can tell 
 This is the worst poem ever written. I was writting beter poetry when I was three!! Don't buy this "book" (It's long enough to be called one) it is the worst investment ever 
 This book is a poorly-written cry of a book.  Don't wate your time 
 Fight Club is without a doubt the greatest film I've ever seen. Yeah, I'm a fanboy. And what? And to make a great film flow, you need great music, right? Well, you need great music that fits the film, and the Dust Brother's score more than does the trick. The film is dark yet satirical, and it needed a score that would compliment that.   However, the score simply doesn't stand up on its own. At times in the film it perfectly enhances the dark atmosphere, but its only a part of a tense scene. And hence, it sounds rather empty by itself.  No matter how much you like the film or thought the music sounded good in it (as I did), I wouldn't recommend it. Like so many other scores, it could have been made into great music but fails since its just lifted from the film 
 This is an example of one of those thousands of guitar books which discusses several subjects in a superficial way and never really nails anything down in a useful way. The author has not put forth a single original idea or even bothered to present the same old stuff in a new and different way. This book is not a guide to the fretboard, it is basic music theory for absolute beginners. If you want rock solid information about the guitar's fretboard skip this and do what everyone else does:  get Fretboard Logic. The author has released several books under the same title with pretty much the same stuff in each one. This one is a Mel Bay retread 
 They show a pony in the picture. But You won't get it, just be careful when you think you will get the dining set and the pony. If you mistakly bought it . Just keep it. You will only get partial refund which is half the buying price. 
 Although I do enjoy many of Charles Warren Eaton's landscapes, I found this book to contain alot of black and white reproductions of artwork and alot of text to fluff it up. The cover enticed me to purchase this book, a wonderful painting with vivid color and bold brushwork. But the interior color plates are not nearly as exciting, and too few in number 
 The picture makes the exterior 'look' like it is suede-esk, but it's actually a cheap thin mixture between fabric and plastic.  The heat barely radiates through and only when the cat is inside (although the bottom of unit is always toasty).    The cord is the best feature.  Very sturdy and assuring.  Would not suggest this product.  Over priced 
 This is just like the English version but in Spanish. The content does not reflect the culture or morals of the general Latino people. Nearly all models (especially on the cover) are white and/or American and are very thin and tall. They try to use photos of American celebrities when they have brown hair, for example Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore, Angelina Jolie or just natural brunettes like Catherine Zeta-Jones. Maybe Cosmo thinks we're too ignorant and can be easily fooled by the dark hair dye job or the computer generated tans. There are tons of beautiful and succesful Latinas that could easily be placed on the covers but I think they'd rather just use the same photos that they already took for their English-version magazines. The ads are also for high-end American and European products. I've bought this magazine in Mexico and while it still has the same problems at least they feature real Mexicans and Mexican products in some of the ads.   If you want a magazine that more reflects Latino culture, although it's mostly in English, get Latina Magazine. They use lots of Latina models and it's more relevant to Latin-American women and people interested in Latino culture 
 This one is a trip to say the least. It starts strange even from  the menu (my menu's play button says "On Air"). Then we go steaming into the movie itself. A crazy housewife throws herself and her retarded son off a building. Cut to a mildly intense (and very exploitively shot) rape scene. Then we are experiencing the day to day happenings of a home for the retarded - where the head administrator is the rapist. I'm not really spoiling anything here. The movie lets this on about 20 minutes in. The man that plays the rapist goes over the top, to say the least. At one point he stalks around his room, crazy and horny  (wearing a jock strap, no less) fondling and strangling a  mannequin. The movie tries to hide its lust for exploitation under the guise of being a film about a serious subject. You can ultimately tell that it was filmed for the T and A. There's quite a bit during the two rape scenes. Also, the helpful teacher gets dolled up towards the end. Although her idea of being sexy is seductively drinking a clamdigger - celery included. But there is no nudity from her sadly (I think she's cute). And it is rather off putting to have the guy walking around in more revealing uderwear than the women. I mean, he's wearing a thong, for God's sake! Is this a Chinese metaphor for being "crazy and sexually rapacious"? You be the judge. I will say, I have seen a lot of bizarre translations on Asian imports, but this one contains one of the classics. During a scene when an angry crowd is confronting the administrator out front of the home - a man yells in his face and says "You let me f*** and a**  and I say your good, damn!" And he's supposed to be angry at this guy? Truly a hilarious moment. And people in the film refer to rapists as "sex lupines". I really don't know how to translate that one. Ultimately a bizarre flick that doesn't deliver on much that it promises. The rape scenes are not too schocking (especially when compared to something like IRREVERSIBLE). I will say the last sequence is pretty gruesome. Fluorescent bulbs and table saws, anyone? Ultimately, a lot of the acting comes off as B-grade. Some sickos out there - we are legion - might enjoy parts, but most would probably prefer to stay away.  I'm keeping my copy though... 
 I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation "i'm your man" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of "if it be your will" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. "If It be your will" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. "mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ." or "i am so very happy, so please hit me" or "river of sorrow, don't swallow" or the breathy way he says the word "twilight" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.   Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says "if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved "if it be your will" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort. 
 This is not the same model I bought but it looks like it's built the same way.  I bought the InMotion Trampoline by Stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use.  It didn't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off.  When I called for warrantey information, I had waited too long, it is only guaranteed for 90 days.  I'd give it negative stars, but I have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up 
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
 No matter how popular you are, there is no candidate so far on any country's election day who dares to put the voters and supporters behind and goes to the countryside to ride a horse. Nobody could do this except the guy in this novel. As a political figure such as an US Congressman, you are always surrounded by lot of people, aides, rallies, reporters...and no matter how popular you are, you definitely wouldn't dare to ride a horse in Texas countryside on an election day if you are one of the two candidates. Because 1)you have to vote for yourself first and taking pictures; 2)you have to be interviewed by reporters; 3) you have to stay at the campaign headquarters to show your gratitude that you really care of the outcome, no matter how popular you are. The highly unlikely premise of this book is an Achilles's Heel doomed to be fatal. That's why I have suggested publishers in Taiwan not to purchase this book's tranlation right, because it even failed to establish itself from the very beginnin 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 While the ancillary material on cryptid hominids is well organized, representing a reasonably clean presentation of typically widely scattered material, the lion's share of the book is valueless for one simple reason: not one claim is substantiated. It would indeed justify rewriting human history were a machined steel component unearthed in an Ordovician matrix or a precisely carved stone tool found embedded in Mesozoic strata. Yet, despite the copious bibliography, there is not one footnote associating any of the outrageous claims with a verifiable, published source. Beyond that, some of the claims are just plain silly: for example, I have trouble seeing through the authors' eyes how a vaguely dumbbell-shaped outline in archaic shale is ironclad evidence that a shod human foot walked past in remote times. Mine the Internet for the useful cryptid material and save your money otherwise 
 I am a fan of Dan Poyter's, and I have learned a lot from this author's monumental work, "The Self-Publishing Manual". I thought this title, "Writing Nonfiction : Turning Thoughts into Books", is another one of such great works. I was so disappointed while reading this book when I realized that it was nothing but a rehash of the original book. I just could not understand how a professional author could have the audacity to publish the same book under two different titles and sell both to the same audience. I don't know if you get, I just don't. To make matters worse, this title is not as detailed as the original work. So, if you are interested in learning from this man, I suggest that you get a copy of "The Self-Publishing Manual", rather than this one. I gave this book 1 star, not because it does not contain useful information, but because it contains nothing new from the author's previous publication. It is really unfortunate. I felt cheated. 
 Don`t waste your time and money on this compilation.  What a cheap shot to take the consumers money.  Read the very fine print, it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it.  Shame on the distributor! 
 I bought this book based on a customer review, and I'm sorry I did.  What I want is comfortable elegance in my home, but what I got was the last century's take on country/cottage design. Now what do I do with this book? Give it to my mother 
 These gloves are well made leather gloves with an iron bar for good grip but they're very light and offer no support for the wrist or hand. In addition, the padding is very thin. I wouldn't recomend them for heavy bag or working with a trainer. They're probably fine for the speed bag.   If you're going to use these gloves, at the very least also get yourself a pair of hand wraps or, like me, you'll probably loose some skin from your knuckles.  For not very much more money, you can get gloves that offer significantly more protection 
 Good thing I was able to return this book. Way too short and provided lack of important information. Much of the text can be researched online and most of their ideas are common sense. The Appendix they provided are weak. The web sites provide little to zero of help. If you really want to learn more about this kind of business, ask directing to the manufacture. 
 Paul Lombardo, a leading scholar on bioethics and eugenics, is working on a book on this same topic. According to his bio page, the working title is  "Better for All the World: Eugenics, the Supreme Court and Buck v. Bell." I'm guessing professor Lombardo will have to change the title of the book now that Bruinius has published one with the same name, but whatever he calls it, it will be worth the wait. Lombardo's previous work on eugenics is brilliant and Bruinius' is, well, anything but 
 ok so i've never read this book, but if you need a book to navigate amazon.com, then you should just give me your money instead.  I mean, I know it's hard to type a word and press enter, and then press buy; i think the real difficulty of amazon.com is how the author managed to write XXX pages about navigating amazon.com.  Having said that, it almost makes me want to buy this book, so I'm changing my 1 Star to 2.  
 I wanted to like this film, I really did, but it was the slowest moving film I've ever seen. Potentially a good story, it was spoiled by poverty-stricken dialogue, long pauses and a lack of action. Charley fell in love with Eban but it was impossible to figure out why - Eban had a black hole where his personality should have been and "scintillate" was clearly not a word in his vocabulary. Most gay teachers are quite charismatic; not Eban! Could do better 
 Not worth the money. Little explanation of anything especially how he achieved the results he describes. Even the first page is a chart with no explanation. Don't buy if your interested in learning about the Forex. I should have known better with a title like that! 
 Before I start, let me nail my colours to the mast: I'm pro-science, I'm pro-evolution, I really like the idea of rational enquiry and I'm a sceptic bordering on the cynical. I'm *not* some lentil-munching, kaftan-wearing, feng-shui-hugging hippie with airbrushed unicorns and a yin-yang sign on the side of my Kombi. Honestly.  Now we've got that cleared up, let me say it straight: This book takes on some big arguments, but, other than humorously swatting some flies, loses hands down. All it succeeds in doing is illustrating that there are fakers, losers, charlatans and wankers to be found in the Social Sciences departments of any given University. Anyone who's been to university and didn't know that deserves a clip around the ear and to be sent to the back of the class. Now either Sokal didn't know that ( - ~clip~ -), or he's spent half his book shooting fish in a barrel. That might seem like good sport, but before long it becomes obvious it's a cheap thrill.  Having said that, I sincerely doubt that the titillation of seeing dumb French Feminists taken apart is what made this book such a splash: I think it's because of Sokal's purported intent: to undermine the notion of cognitive relativism, especially as it associated with modern philosophy of science, in particular the work of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend. This is the battle: Sokal aligns with those who say scientists are the exclusive purveyors of a shining light called truth; the Barbarians at the gate are these simpering postmodernists who want to tear the temple down.  While the poseurs cited in this book are certainly (for the most part) phoneys or idiots, I think Thomas Kuhn was neither, and while Paul Feyerabend overplayed the court jester hand, he had some important things to say too.  So, to the first point: Proving that one writer (or a hundred, or a thousand) who purports to adhere to relativism is a charlatan doesn't establish anything about *the idea* of relativism. All you have established is that you have a found yourself a charlatan. Give yourself a star.   But while you're pinning it on, remember that postmodernists do not have a monopoly on illogical, bamboozling, balderdash:  Example: Sir Roger Penrose (Emeritus Rouse Ball professor of mathematics at Oxford University, no less) and his dreadful, lumpen-headed, and deliberately bamboozling anti-AI tract "The Emperor's New Mind". The very point of the (no doubt correct but nonetheless entirely irrelevant) science deluged on the reader in that book is to obscure the fact that the real emperor was Roger Penrose and his arguments on AI really blow the kumara.   Example: Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker's Linguistic Nativism, which has held sway for a good thirty years in many linguistics departments, and is anything but post-modern: nativism holds that humans have an innate understanding of grammar hard wired into their biology. From my paltry readings in linguistics and the philosophy of language, my impression is that Pinker's and Chomsky's arguments are seriously flawed. (See: Sampson: "The Language Instinct Debate" for a thorough linguistic critique of nativism; see Rorty: "Contingency Irony, and Solidarity" for a philosophical perspective on the contingency of language). Make note of this example, as it becomes relevant later on.  Secondly, Sokal and Bricmont (quite deliberately) refuse to engage on certain topics, in particular on cultural or aesthetic relativism, which they say (without providing a reason) "raise very different issues". Take that star away, for this statement betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about relativism. Actually, ethical, aesthetic and cognitive relativisms raise different manifestations of *exactly* the same issue: Cognitive relativism, in that it relates to "epistemic" truth (as opposed to "moral" truth or "aesthetic" truth - both of which seem intuitively more questionable ideas) is simply a cut closer to the quick: indeed, the aesthetic and moral brands of relativism rely for their plausibility on cognitive relativism anyway (i.e. if the truths we understand about the physical universe are contingent on our language, then it follows that ideals of right and wrong and beauty must be similarly contingent on our language).  Thirdly, Sokal provides the following account of cognitive relativism:   "While scientists ... try to obtain an objective view ... of the world, relativist thinkers tell them that they are wasting their time and that such an enterprise is, in principle, an illusion"  Now that, to put it mildly, is a *very* punchy version of relativism, and not one that any credible relativist philosopher I know of (and certainly not Thomas Kuhn, who spent a whole book explaining how and why the process scientific discovery works) subscribes to.  That is, in the trade, known as a straw-man argument: You set it up to knock it over. Here goes:   P1: Relativists say science is a waste of time P2: Science helps us reliably predict and react coherently to phenomena occurring in the world  P3: Things which help to predict and react to such phenomena have genuine utility  C1: Therefore, science has genuine utility C2: Ergo, science is not a waste of time  Case closed. Is relativism dead? No: the problem is, most relativists I know would completely agree with all of the above argument except for premise 1. The cat is most definitely still out of the bag. (In a nutshell, all reasonably stated relativism says is that you can't know that your theory actually maps onto the actual configuration of the outside world; it may, it may not: logically there will always be some other possible explanation for the same set of data, however implausible or difficult to imagine, and in part that difficulty in imagination may be a function of the historical contingency of our belief in, and description of the world in terms of, the current "paradigm". Relativism simply says the best you can do is to know that, for now, your theory works, not that it is *true*. Though Sokal and Bricmont may disagree, I don't think this is controversial amongst philosophers nor, really, scientists.)  Lastly, in criticising an admittedly utterly ludicrous passage bestowed on the world by that splendidly silly feminist philosopher Sylvia Kristeva, Sokal makes the following footnote:  "...Kristeva seems to be appealing ... to the 'Sapir-Whorf thesis' in linguistics that is ...that our language radically conditions our view of the world. This thesis nowadays is sharply criticised by some linguists: see, for example Pinker ..."  Hold the phone. The implication is that the Sapir-Whorf thesis (as to the contingency of language) has been discredited, but by none other than Steven Pinker in his "The Language Instinct" which, as per the above, is at the very least a controversial piece of writing. This is an extremely important point, since it's utterly central to the credibility of the anti-relativist cause, and if one takes Geoffrey Sampson's book (cited above) at face value the nativist claims themselves are built on very suspect reasoning and scientific research. It seems to me (and to writers like Richard Rorty) that language must radically condition our view of the world, because that's the only basis on which we can even describe it.  At the end of the day, properly stated cognitive relativism is no a threat to modern scientific discourse, except that it relegates the scientist from "truth knower" or "person through whom you may have exclusive access to the truth" (sounds a bit like a grand high pooh-bah or - dare I say it - high priest, doesn't it?) to "person whose theory works the best for now" and who may be in competition for that status with other people in the community whether or not they're scientists.   If science *does* work better than feng shui or healing crystals (and I, for one, think it does) then this shouldn't be a particularly troubling way of looking at the world for a scientist who is at ease with his views and his value to the community. So it makes the knee-jerk reactions against relativism, from the likes of Sokal and elsewhere Richard Dawkins, all the more mystifying.  Olly Buxton 
 Mostly a very flippant, merry tale that could have been better - or much worse. It did not elicit strong opinions in me either way, in regard to style or substance. The story is very post-modern, a little beat and, yes, quite drunken in parts. The form is distractingly lazy and light. If there is a charm or allure of this book, it would stem almost absolutely from Hunter S. Thompson's later fame and cult status and the romantic idea that "The Rum Diary" represents some kind of "lost" work. Those are interesting angles, but this novel is not strong enough to merit loud praise where literature and storytelling are concerned 
 I actually bought this book the day it was released but I never did finish it. The first time reading it was horrible. I end up falling asleep with it in the middle of the day. I didn't pick this book up again until two days ago. Since Dream Hunter was just released, which btw is just as bad, I thought maybe I should give this book another try. I told myself, maybe the second time around would be better. It wasn't. Instead, it took me two days to finish. I never take more then a day to finish a good book. This time around I actually forced myself to finish. Ravyn was the most boring hero I've encounter and Susan was just plain annoying. I felt that this book was not meant to really tell a story of Ravyn and Susan, but it's more of an excuse to introduce characters for future stories. 
 If you manage in a high-intensity service industry and are looking for tips on how to evoke higher performance from your knowledge workers, keep searching for another book.  Take 5 minutes and read the summary at the end of the chapters; you'll quickly see that there is little practical information or depth here 
 I was really disappointed with this.  I was looking for a book that would explain the use of heart rate zones and help me use it to improve my cycling.  This is a 12 step program to zen cycling!  It is overly complex and involved way too much "process."  Almost every paragraph introduces a new idiosynchratic piece of jargon - microcycles, mesocycles, and macrocycles - give me a break!  This book outlines an entire plan without detailing the plan!  You must make a goal and write it down.  You must decide whether you want to use "threshold" heart rate or maximum heart rate.  You must calculate your zones.  You must then periodize your training and then personalize the periodization (or maybe you personalize first and then periodize).  It is simply too evangelical to be of any use unless you buy into the zen program.  For someone who has a specific goal, this book may help you achieve it.  If you just want to be a better cyclist, this is a waste of time 
 I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time! 
 I don't mean to sound harsh, however, I wish that I had read the reviews before I purchased this book. The title and story line sounded beyond intriguing, however, the book was far from that. I am not quite sure how a person is supposed to learn about the psychology of serial killers in this book when the majority of the book is a compilation of convicted murderers claiming their innocence. Out of the 306 pages and 14 serial killers I found only one to be somewhat informational. Although the testimony of David Gore was at times hard to read I felt that his confessions were the only ones that allowed a person to get another glance into the mind of a serial killer. My suggestion would be to go to the bookstore, find this book, spend a few minutes to read the David Gore letters and then put it back on the shelf before you waste your money 
 The author writes well and I certainly appreciated that.  However, his spiritual journey seems primarily to emphasize his lack of focus and his ability to see Judaism and Buddhism as "one-size-fits-all" spiritual companions.  I felt that his analogies between the two religious philosophies were stretched rather thin and I was never entirely certain why he felt so strongly that the two must be related or joined together.  I also felt that in several instances, he misrepresented Jewish theological ideas in order to make them fit more neatly into a Buddhist mold.  For example, he tries to relate the Buddhist notions of reincarnation with those of Jewish Kabbalistic mystics.  While there are similarities, he never makes note of the fact that reincarnation is not a particularly strong thread within any of the major denominations of Judaism.  All in all, after reading this book, the phrase, "self-indulgent" keeps coming to mind.  I'm sure it was important for him to write it -- I'm just not convinced that it's important for others to read 
 'Moving Target, The' is the first novel in which noir-American writer Ross McDonald introduces his most famous detective, Lew Archer. Published in 1948, in a time when noir movies was at the top, the book is just a unremarkable pulp fiction story with classic ingredients as murder, treason, much money, kidnapped and poor ladies in distress. When you read 'Moving Target, The' you feel that McDonald was very far to develop a strong and convincing work; in fact, most of the time the reader will feel the influence of some other authors hovering above Mc Donald's style. Great authors, to be sure, as Raymond Chandler, for instance. The story is just normal, and sometimes even full of flaws. But Archer is a good characther. In a way, his sympathy and easy way saves this book to be a complete misfire.  
 The editorial review goes on about how lavish a production this movie was. It  really wasn't. Simply having a few cheap props, mono coloured rooms and a cast of extras dancing about doesn't mean much. Pit and the Pendulum was the most lavish production. Pit also had superior music. Masque suffers from a bland plot. The only thing that saves the movie was Price.   It should also be noted this dvd is not a quality dvd. It may not play in all players. I think this is the last "midnight movie" double features I buy. This is my second. The other plays in my computer's dvd player, both sides. This dvd only plays one movie on my computer's dvd player. No doubt these dvds are being ran off in someone's garage. 
 I have never read an Iris Johansen book that I didn't like...until this one. The characters were never developed and were unbelievable. Sophie is supposedly a genius researcher and a doctor. MacDuff is a Scottish laird who's background we never learn about. Two gorgeous killers who we're supposed to empathize with. The list goes on.   I forced my way through the book, what a waste of time. I'll think twice before I read another one. Hopefully this was an anomoly 
 This book is tripe.  I was forced to read it for a college class, and am disappointed by the lack of substance in the book.  While it  claims to be about tributes to fallen soldiers in Vietnam, it spends a substantial portion of the time discussing battle monuments of the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, along with an extended discussion of the dedication of the Gettysburg battlegrounds.  It looks too far into many of the objects left, such as the bike tube and nursing pads.  Frankly, I'm ashamed to be associated with the same instution as this woman.  Don't read it if you don't have to 
 I think my title is a tip-off to my review. When I got this toy, I charged it for as long as it told me, then I tried it. It didn't even sputter. Then I tried it again, and charged it, since for some reason it ran out of battery. Didn't work. I then tried bouncing the beam of the cieling to the ufo, no go. I tried launching it from middair, it just fell. Then I charged it again. Seems repetitive, don't it? Then, 5 minutes later, after almost giving up, I tried it, IT ACTUALLY FLEW, and then crushed my hopes by stopping and falling on my face, and then it never worked again. Just so I can prove it wasn't just my ufo, 5 of my friends got the ufo, with similar destructive results. Unless you want to buy a piece of styrofome with a propeller for to much money than its worth, don't even bother getting it. And don't beleive the salesmen at the store that actually use it, they get working tested ones 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 Tom Peters should take this book off the market. It's the most disjointed  piece of work I have ever picked up... thinking I would find useful  approaches. Instead it is a cartoon of phrases he has collected over the  years and most of them are trying to coin words which are not ever going to  "make my day". This is an example of a well known author selling  one based on his name and certainly not content or value. Save your money 
 This is one of the worst written books I've had the displeasure of reading.  I can spare you the misery.  Companies recover from slumping quarters and dissapointing returns by increasing their communication, co-operation and collaboration.  That's the entire book in one sentence.  The hubris that wreaks from this book is denser than the arrogance it oozes on each page.  The text suffers from redundancy to the millionth degree, by the way.  I vote less than one star, however Amazon forces a one star minimum 
 This book is so appalling that I honestly do not understand why a publisher would put out something like this.  It is almost 300 pages of what looks like a power point presentation.  There is hardly a complete sentence in the entire book- just bullet points.  As a reader I am disgusted at this format and hope that this is not a sign of things to come. I simply could not "read" this book.  The presentation is terrible. There are no proper sentences, no paragraphs and therefore little in the way of intelligent analysis.  Not being illiterate I hated it because its message was impossible to decipher. Who knows what it is about -   I wish I could give it zero stars. 
 The author makes some good choices on which seasons to profile,such as 1908, 1951, 1991, etc. Also, he makes a pertinent point for all 1998-nuts, titling his chapter on 1993 "The Last Pure Pennant Race." However, the author is obviously prejudiced toward the era he grew up in, selecting no less than FIVE of the fourteen profiled from the 1940's.  Indians only won the pennant because the Black Sox were throwing games down the stretch! 1964? You've got to be kidding! The Phillies experienced one of the all-time "crash-and-burn" moments in baseball history, losing their final ten games, allowing St. Louis to "back into" the pennant! The major factor in weighing the "all-time greatest pennant races" should hinge mainly on the fan excitement they create.  Here, Anderson spends two of his choices on great collapses, where only the eventual winner's fans benefit; rather than picking two other races where BOTH teams played great ball down the stretch, giving fans in BOTH cities something to cheer about! The 1904 Boston-N.Y. American League race , or the 1915 Boston-Detroit AL race would have been much better choices. At any rate, I wasn't all that impressed with Anderson's writing style. It lacked tension, organization, and failed to present some of the really great races in a wider historical context. Mostly valuable for it's details of baseball's greatest and most suffocating pennant race, 1908 
 If you are looking for a CD that basically incorporates sounds of a person's heartbeat with a lot of shushing sounds, and very faint female light vocals in the background (not actual words - just sounds) - then this is the CD for you. I did not expect this when I bought it. In my opinion, it was not very relaxing, my baby still screamed his head off and it really didn't help much. I had serious issues with colic and honestly the only things that helped were the books, "Secrets of the Baby Whisperer" and "The Happiest Baby on the Block". If you are looking for a good bedtime CD - I would go with First Whispers Sleeptime Edition. 
 There's absolutely NOTHING new here, and it is based only on secondary sources.  Folks should read Middlekauf's GLORIOUS CAUSE instead, and leave this one on the shelves 
 The title pretty much lets you know what you're getting. It's a grade-C howler but not as blatantly funny as I was hoping. Directed by exploitation film specialist Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before directing "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the Philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. Playing hooker and small-time drug dealer Lee Daniels, blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while long-forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely Patty Hearst-like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. Naturally antagonistic toward each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. Run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron, the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half-hearted cat-fighting as Lee and Karen are pitted against each other. Of course, they escape but shackled together a la "The Defiant Ones" and continue the cat-fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits.  Meanwhile, various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit - the loutish drug lord looking for Lee who stole $40K from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen, and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord). Needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of Filipino women, a dog wears Karen's panties and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion (one beer-bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face). There is a rather sad ending, but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise. Sadly, Grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazonian blonde whom I am convinced is trying desperately to be credible. Since no one displays any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except balding, bug-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra 
 THE BELT CLIP IS LOSE AFTER HAVING IT FOR 1 MONTH CAN NOT ATTACH TO PANTS HAVE TO HOLD IT IN MY HANDS 
 Regrettably the book was damaged on receipt and had to be returned. In view of the distance it was not deemed worthwhile to have a replacement. The refund system worked perfectly 
 The first two reviewers did a great job of describing the storyline, so I won't go there.  I'll tackle the ending...WHAT ENDING?  I even backed it up to see what I missed. THEN, I went to the special features to see an alternate ending.  It varied little from the shows ending. After investing the time to see this movie, I hated the ending. However, Jacqueline Bisset is still very lovely. Adam Garcia didn't too badly and I did like the sounndtrack so there were a few saving graces... 
 The set up for this novel is interesting, if a bit easy to anticipate in the first half. The father: stoic and crushed by his love for a flighty, mentally ill woman. The mother: beautiful, ravaged by her own mental sickness, seemingly self-obsessed and consumed by superficial things. The brother: distant and angry. The daughter: spunky with a desire to rise above it all, hungry for the love of her brother and father. I was never--not once--surprised by any of these characters until the father found an interest in the occult in the middle of the book, and by then, I just didn't buy his his sudden turn. Lots of things happened, but by the middle of the book, I kept thinking, when is something going to happen that moves me?    Part of the reason that so many events with the potential to elicit great empathy from the reader fail to do so is that the book feels like so much backstory, so much summary. We rarely get to be fully present in the past moment with the characters, and because of this, the characters feel very distant and stiff.  But ultimately, this book frustrated me because of the awkward, contorted prose. Look--I'm fine with fragments and run on sentences, but when there is no rhyme or reason as to why so many are being used, they lose their impact and importance. The sentence structures in this book are beyond affected, and they really take away from what could have been an interesting story. I quit reading 2/3 of the way in, I will admit. However, if I feel nothing by then, there is a problem 
 This is a compendium of several articles. Haught makes the same argument over and over again - that God loves the world so much that he is willing to leave it alone to determine it's own destiny. He offers little in the way of evidence of this assertion. It's an interesting idea, but it doesn't need an entire book - the first one or two chapters make the point 
 Rather disappointed. Only a few real usefull hints, some obvious "secrets", very disorganized, no logic structure.  I will be more careful selecting my next purchase espacially as I had to pay 10 Euro on top for the customs.. 
 Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author 
 I didn't like the way she skipped around in the next chapter 
 This movie should come with a prescription label that reads: "Take this film at bedtime as needed for sleeplessness."   Dear God, what a boring, montonous mess: Long, static shots of a townhouse that last minutes at a time; ambiguity and a frustratingly cryptic plot make this a very hard film to sit through. I don't need a movie to hold my hand and hit me over the head with answers, but for the love of God, reveal something interesting! The excruciating glacial pace makes Antonioni look like Michael Bay. Coffee was no cure; neither was a bag of chips. Sleep overcame me despite my greatest desire to watch and pay close attention to this movie.  The "startling moment" everyone describes is when one character slices his own throat, spraying blood everywhere. This scene is almost incongruous, since it is quick, violent, and horrifying, unlike the rest of the movie.  I have watched hundreds of foreign movies, and have liked most of them. However, CACHE is one of the worst I've seen. No resolution, no answers, incomprehensible, no likeable characters, impossibly slow. I want to know why the main character was getting those videos sent to him. And would someone please explain the last shot of the movie to me? It is a long shot (again) of a school entrance with kids going back and forth. Then the main character's kid and the Algerian's kid meet and talk to each other. So what? What the hell? I slept through this movie just to see this scene? I almost want to slash MY own throat for watching this self-indulgent exercise.   Supposedly this a movie about guilt and how it affects you your entire life. The director should feel guilty for foisting this nonsense upon the audience and shilling it at as a "suspense" movie. The only suspension I hold now is for movie review opinions that praise this movie endlessly. These people have to be kidding.  Oh, and the rooster who gets his head cut off in a flashback scene? At least he didn't have to sit through the rest of this movie fighting off drowziness and staring at interminable minutes of meaningless video of a townhouse 
 Plot summary; magic girls + monsters + school girl outfits, basically all you need to know.  This is just a review for volume one, not the entire manga series.  For those who are not aware the anime and the manga for "Mai-Hime" are almost totally different so if you're a fan of the the series I'd definitely say check out the manga as well for a different perspective on their world.  There's a lot more fan service...a lot more...  I'm a sucker for that stuff so I'm not complaining but be warned those of you who are turned off by it.    At this point I'm really not that into the story and it has been my interest in how the manga and anime differ and all the pretty pictures that kept me turning the pages.  My friends have told me it is quite good but unfortunately based on volume one I cannot say I would recommend this to anyone except hardcore Mai Hime fans and probably people who enjoyed Ikkitousen.  Hopefully things will change with volume two 
 Only a pompous windbag would name a "law" about investing after himself.  Can you say shameless self promotion?  Let Leboeuf make his next million on someonelse's back.  Spend your money, instead, on "The Millionaire Next Door".  That will give you the right mentality.  Then read "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" for implementation ideas 
 I couldnt even get past the first chapter without stopping for a few days before I started again. And when i did continue to read it didn't get any better. As a matter of fact it got worst. I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone else. I'd rather watch mariah careys GLITTER 
 I wouldn't recommend this book at all for one your better off going to see the movie because the book tells a whole bunch of different stories which leads you in different storis instead of just talking about the same thing the whole movie. I would just recommed seeing the movie over the book 
 The story is touching and has a nice message.  However, the garish, ugly, busy pictures undermine the impact of the story.  Imagine what this book would have been like if Wendell Minor had done the illustrations! Instead, the illustrations with their dreadful colors and awful images confuse and alienate children who are the assumed target audience.  This will not be a book a child would be naturally drawn to and would stay on most library shelves, which is unfortunate since the story is so delightful 
 I bought this book b/c it made the NYT Book Review list of top novels, but the author began the novel crying that slick willie was treated oh so unfairly by we churchgoing middle-America do-gooders (I am a Southern moderate who despises the Clintons for what they are - common trash) But it isn't the politics, per se, that that turned me away from the novel, I just find it hard to believe that such temporal political whinnying can be a prelude to a work of any depth, or even a mark of a serious novelist.  And so I don't want to waste my time with it.  I did like the top ranked novel, though, Beloved.  Couldn't put it down 
 When I the reviews to this book I thought to myself: this is going to be the read of the summer. So naturally, I went to my local bookstore and paid $24.00. A few hours later, I went back and returned it. It was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere. I don't know why so many liked it but it was so mean and pointless, with no execuse for its swearing. Literature isn't trash, Mr. Carey. 
 This book is really basic.  I found that "How to Make Big Money Mowing Small Lawns" as a better resource.  It had easy to understand charts. Simplistic pricing method. Simple to understand and extremely helpful/useful in earning extra income. This book offers unique and insightful ideas to help get you off the ground.

 I love cozies and am very fond of the Miss Julia series.  I had to lower my rating of this book because there is a 98 page reminiscence in the middle of it that provides nothing new to the loyal reader of this series. That's about 1/3 of the book. Very disappointing. 
 I listened first to the Power of Intention, which was the reason I purchased the Secrets of the Power of Intention.  I found the Secrets of the Power of Intention to be a long version of the Power of Intention, by far the Power of Intention is a disc that will fire up ones sense and the drive to learn more and more.  The Secrets of the Power of Intention is BORING and makes you upset that you even purchased the set, it bring little to lite over the first disc.  I would love to return the disc's, not worth the money 
 I found this book to be lacking.  In character development, plot, etc.  It just never really went anywhere - not that it needed to but it just didn't grab me as her other novels have.  I found it to be very underdeveloped.  Perhaps, as one other reviewer wrote, this was before she hit her stride?  That's what I think 
 There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh! 
 I found this an odd CD.  It had Italian operatic type songs and then pop songs.  It made my wonder who Josh Grobin thinks he is 
 I should have read the other review more closely. This is a good blanket for HOT summer nights! I believe it is too light for cold winter nights. I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 This book is loaded with lots of unintersting information. The other positive reviews for this pamphlet/book must have been submitted by friends & family.  I love Disneyland and there are plenty of good travel guides to get you around the park with important and interesting insider information but this isn't it. Painfully boring from start to finish. For example: #77 Did you know that the giant mushroom at the loading zone of Alice in Wonderland is a former ticket booth? What a waste of money and time 
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 When I read this book a second time, it was because I couldn't believe a title that so many people recommended could really be so devoid of information.  Well, believe it, because "How I Trade for a Living" combines almost no useful suggestions with an almost total lack of organization.  While there is the occasional rambling bit from Gary that is thought provoking, and rank beginners might find information about how he schedules his day interesting, for the most part this text is a disjointed memoir of someone who made money during one of the easiest stock market eras ever after admittedly losing like crazy during eras when trading required real skills.  I think I can summarize the clue level of this text with the following quote from the last page, on the topic of Internet discussion areas:  "I also don't have much tolerance for the doom and gloomers who are forever forecasting an imminent stock market crash".  This, from a title published in 2000.  Think carefully how much you want to follow the advice of someone who was that out of sync with reality when writing his book 
 I had the Lonely Planet and my friend had the Rough guide and the difference was quite great.  The section on the Mekong Delta for example was vastly more in depth in the LP and I would have been totally lost if I had used the Rough Guide 
 First, let's begin with the premise that the collaberation of, at one time, in one relative place, and with (seemingly) one goal, those who have come to be collectively known as the Founding Fathers was, by any accounts, an extraordinary period in the history of humanity.  A Dream Team, if you will.  Second, let's remind ourselves that none of these men were devoid of their flaws.  Many, in retrospect, carried their warts and blemishes with a sense of pride, if not prominence.  While it is inevitable, and not inappropriate to find an interest in these founders and their various achievements so timely and exciting centuries after they did what they did, it is also inevitable that the lines of truth and accuracy have faded in the interim, and an honest interpretation of events between 1750 and 1820 requires of the interpretor an open mind, and a lack of preconceived notions.  Ms. Appleby has not satisfied that requirement in her Jefferson interpretation.  Appleby admits in the opening paragraphs to be an admirer, and continues to clarify that point throughout the book.  She sets Jefferson apart from the other 'founders,' who are minimized, if not dismissed as having provided less,if any substance to the drive for that ultimate goal.  Indeed, Appleby seems to be saying that the goals of the various gentlemen involved were so varied as to be in direct opposition to each other.  Moreover, Appleby outrightly idolizes Jefferson.  Her platitudes do not, however, shine any more light on the man, who certainly qualifies as one of the more secretive/introspective of the bunch.  Instead, one is left the option of accepting Jefferson as a Moses-like character, or of choosing to look elsewhere for a more in depth assessment of this certainly great man.  Other reviewers have noted her attention to Jefferson's issues with slavery, with women, with indians.  These are discussed, but rather than in a way that would try to find a root cause, or to compare them with other frailties in his character, the effort seems to be to offer them as some offset to the bulk of the material, which is close to hero worship.  There is enough information about Jefferson, even considering the depths of his persona, to identify some (but certainly not all) of the demons that tormented the man.  And also enough information to know that Jefferson was not immune to crossing the lines of decorum that separate the common man from the political climber.  But you wont find that discussion here.  In the end, we have yet another portrait of this man, who deserves his place in the pantheon, but ther is no flesh, no blood, no heart.  Just canvas 
 This book weirdly resembles Rebecca Goldstein's Incompleteness.  (See my review of Incompleteness.)  Both books were published within the last two years.  Both books focus on the life and strange personal habits of Goedel, not his ideas.  The authors, both PhDs from Ivy League schools who like writing fiction, can't help injecting themselves into their stories.  The books even tell the same anecdotes:  the Goedels' pink flamingoes; Goedel's indifference to Nazism in Vienna ("the coffee is wretched"); Goedel's checking himself into sanatoria; Goedel getting beaten by thugs and defended by Adele and her umbrella; Wittgenstein calling the lecture "parenthetical" when Turing doesn't show up; etc.  It is as though Levin read Incompleteness, which was published earlier, and decided to fictionalize a good chunk of it and substitute Turing for Einstein.    Like the problem with Incompleteness, the unfortunate problem with Levin's novel is that it concerns the tabloid aspects of the lives of Turing and Goedel at the expense of their mathematical and philosophical ideas.  Turing and Goedel are men of note and worth writing about because of their profound ideas, not because of their delusions, social ineptness, sexual habits, diets, or relations with women, strange as those aspects of their lives were.  Unless those aspects are relevant to or elucidate the ideas themselves, any book about those aspects of their lives will just be a book about two odd men.  Goldstein fails to give an adequate nontechnical account of  the incompleteness theorems.  But at least she tries.  Levin does not even make the attempt.  In the entire 220-page book the only hint at the nature of the incompleteness theorems is a brief, probably invented, conversation at a meeting of the Vienna Circle in 1931  (pp.  87-94).  The only explication of Turing's ideas is another, again probably invented, conversation between Turing and his one-time fiancée  (pp. 160-168).  The book is simply a novel of two strange mathematicians whose mental states finally got the better of them.  The reader can't end the book any more knowledgeable about the incompleteness theorems or, for example, Turing's halting problem than when he started.  At least Levin devotes a large part of the book to Turing, instead of mentioning him nearly only in passing, as does Goldstein.  And at least Levin, unlike Goldstein, puts Wittgenstein in the background - although not far enough -- where he belongs, instead of giving him center stage.  But why Levin chose to write a fictional account of the lives of Goedel and Turing instead of a biography or a popular account of their ideas is baffling.  Her storytelling style is nothing special.  All that is here is an unentertaining novel about two mathematicians with bizarre behavior.  Goldstein's Incompleteness is the better book, which is not saying much at all. 
 This is such a condesending book about "Middle America."   The characters seem like the creation of a Harvard undergrad who thinks that mid west rubes are just so darn cute and earthy. Yuck 
 This book is awful!  It was a total waste of time. I was really intrigued by the cover - yes, I know better than to judge a book by it's cover, however; the subject matter sounded interesting since I am a stay at home mother.  I think the reviewer who said:  Don't Read It If You're Black, Gay or Female - said it all perfectly.  I agree with that review 100%.  This book is so lame and has every stereotype possible.  The main character was so far removed from reality and, duh, who didn't see the climactic ending coming.  I find it hard to believe that after 2 children, she didn't know she was pregnant again.  I could go on and on about the character flaws of the main character - not one single redeeming quality.  One of the worst books I've ever read. 
 Seems like WB method is nothing new - testimony - dispute - advocacy.  Sounds like Hegel's - thesis -antithesis - synthesis ? WB like Purdue and others see the collapse of history as a way of understanding ancient  Israel,but if all we have left are words,who would want to trust a god who  talks but doesn't do anything  
 Not insightful, not even humorous. I am willing to admit that maybe I just don't get his writing style, whatever that might be. I hope Mr. Rakoff gets into a new line of wor 
 AVOID THIS PRODUCT, wait till PS3 with it's Hard drive an hope something better will come out.  Memory cards are flash memory an flash memory is FRAGILE, one whoops an it's destroyed.  Damn to hell Sony for making us pop 25 bucks a memory card in the first place.  BAD: STAY AWAY FROM MAX MEMORY MANAGER... DO NOT LOAD GAME SAVES FROM THE INTERNET ONTO YOUR MEMORY CARDS. IT WILL CORRUPT AN DESTROY YOUR MEMORY CARD/CARDS. One memory card is worth more than this stupid thing. I lost two memory cards an ALL my bazillion hours of gameplay.   ALSO... the disc sucks, when the PS2 is warm, it won't recognize the disc & if you break or mess the disc up, no way you can make a copy of it an use that. Your screwed!  GOOD: The codes work an it's great to whip through a game that was driving you nuts or stressing you out before.  If you have complaints, call Datels US office (727) 431-065 
 I spent hours on tech support with Linksys, and was told to send it back: the product was defective.  So I did, and Amazon gave a refund.  I lost only my time 
 While I am sure the product does what it offers, this is the second version of Elemeents that I have not been able to load on my computer.  That's where the fun begins - Adobe's support is dreadful.  Their website is unusuable - other than constantly trying to sell you additional products and services - and they have no human support on weekends 
 To tell you the truth, I couldn't make heads nor tails out of this book.  The language is too far away from even modern, and the characters are confusing.  I love sci-fi, even the new computer-oriented (some call it cyberpunk) stuff like "Snow Crash", but "Synners" is just strange.  Ala the Emperor's New Clothes..."Oh my, how strange!  It must be good!"  No, sorry, it's just strange.  I actually came here (to Amazon reviews) to see if anybody else had made sense of it.  I thought I might read farther if I understood it better.  I'm only to page 18, and I doubt I'll finish it. Dou 
 I do not know who the target audience was here, but it certainly was not me, and I am a big Hayek fan. This book is way over my head. Perhaps a doctorate in economics or philosophy would make this work easier to read, but I don't think the average intelligent, interested reader will want to struggle though this material. It never comes up for air. 
 As the past reviewer I did not arrive to the page with THE END printed on it, and I really hate to be unable to finish a book. Anecdote aside, I am aware that my review lacks proper grounds, but since there is so much to  read and too little time, I strongly suggest you to look for other works of  this author. During the first chapter I seems to be going great, the drama  was cleaver and catchy. But suddenly in the second chapter it just stops  and all the events seem to be going nowhere. Besides the construction of  the language is boring and confusing. It feels like the author worked in  this novel for a while, then left it during some years locked in a closet  and one fine day decided to complete it, but without being at ease doing  so 
 I wouldn't recommend this book.  it is hard to follow, it doesn't satisfy the answers to your question and I've already found 2 illnesses that aren't in this book that my kids have recently had 
 I admire Ross Lowell's inventions enormously. His lights, while not as robust as others and so not so well suited to rental houses, are a great tool for the beginning owner-operator. I began with his Lowel Lights and moved up to his D-heads. I remember them all fondly, even though I no longer use them.  After many years as a director of photography,  I've begun to teach lighting and have been looking at book options for my students. So far the best book I've found on this topic is Blain Brown's "Motion Picture and Video Lighting". While the layout of Lowell's book is stunning, as are many of the images, Lowell approaches each section with long lists which to my mind do nothing to inspire the thinking eye.  With great respect for Lowell, I regretfully report that for me his book is for the encyclopediast, not for the emerging eye.  
 I haven't read King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table since I was in high school, but I have become fascinated with the retelling of the Arthurian tale written by various authors.  I picked up Guenevere, Queen of the Summer Country because someone had recommended the book as one of the best retelling tales centered on the legend of King Arthur.  Bah!  This uninspired, uninteresting novel has left a bitter taste in my mouth.  In this retelling, Queen Guenevere lives in the Summer Country, where women rule and take on various lovers other than her husband.  Marrying King Arthur, a Christian instead of a Pagan, means trouble and destruction in Camelot, especially after she meets Sir Lancelot.  Guenevere and Arthur try to create a more peaceful environment for all faiths in Camelot, but there are people who will not allow it, like Merlin and Arthur's sisters, namely Morgan Le Fay.    The aforementioned synopsis is similar to the original tale, which means that not much has been added in this version.  The only difference between this book and the original Arthurian tale is the manner the story is told is quite insipid to me.  Rosalind Miles tries to write the tale from a feminist's point of view, making Guenevere a woman with power in her own right and someone who tries to avoid the overtake of Christianity in Camelot.  But neither her story nor Arthur's is interesting to me.  Not even Merlin and Morgan are fascinating enough to keep me riveted.  I forced myself to read this book in an effort to justify spending fifteen dollars on it.  I won't be giving the other two parts of this trilogy a whirl.  Thank God I hadn't bought them!  I guess I'll have to look for a good King Arthur retelling elsewhere.  I've heard Queen of Camelot by Nancy Mckenzie is good.  I hope I'll have better luck with that one 
 Mr. Yancey has no respect for the teaching of the Bible.  God is always there when it hurts.  In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, "Okay, give it your best shot!"  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn 
 This book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money. page 364:  Principles of Long term investing:  "Chapter 8 shows that among the S&P 500 Index returns, large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks."  Now look at Chapter 8.  "Of the 10 largest corporations, only 2  (Exxon Mobile and Citigroup) are value stocks."  duuhhh.  Now I know what to do.  I have a choice of two stocks.  If you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket, buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart. If you know little, it won't add to your knowledge at all 
 My recommendation is not to waiste time on this book, especially if you are considering meeting a Russian woman.  The only advice  given, was not to seek a Russian wife, and instead for Christians to pray for a wife.  The authors also recommended that if you are not Christian, to convert, and then pray.  Lastly, coauthor Julia Rossedahl clearly had an angry attitude towards any man that would seek a wife from the FSU 
 Amazon.com should immediately cease selling this book.  It was published without Hawking's permission and is a blatant effort to ripoff Stephen Hawking!!    Go to his website, http://www.hawking.org.uk/info/iindex.html, and you will see the following admonishment:  "IMPORTANT NOTE It has come to our attention that the book "The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe" has been published. Professor Hawking would like to make it clear that he has not endorsed this book. The text was written by him many years ago, however the material has already been published in books such as 'A Brief History of Time'. A complaint was made to the Federal Trade Commission in the US in the hope that they would prevent the publication. We would urge you not to purchase this book in the belief that Professor Hawking was involved in its creation. 
 What a disappointment.  I was expecting a great story about sibling rivalry and instead a pseudo murder mystery where the most interesting character was killed within the first several pages.  The sisters, Francesca (smart) and Amanda (pretty) inherit the coffee shop once owned by their deceased parents. They are having a hard time making a go of it, especially when a Starbuck's-like mammoth of a coffee shop sets up shop down the street.  Enter Clarissa, a student at NYU who has big plans for the store and soon is bulldozing her way through everyone.  She decides that the way to drum up business is to have a Mr. Coffee contest and sets about finding hunks to enter the contest.  When the guy that gets chosen as their coffee hunk is found dead, a murder mystery ensues.  Meanwhile, Francesca takes up with the runner up, a model, who she questions as to why he finds her attractive, and wonders why he is not chasing Amanda.  Lots of red herrings are tossed at you, but there really is not a lot of suspense in the end.  In addition to solving the murder, they also discover what really happened to their parents and get closure on their loss.  Save your $10 and check this one out of the library. 
 The audio is hard to hear and the filming is hard to follow. My children were not interested, unimpressed and frustrated with the video. A complete waste of money 
 I was looking for a small cheap Mp3 player and I didn't care how much memory it had so this seemed perfect for me. I saw that many people had rated this 4 and 5 stars so I decided to buy it. When I got the Creative nano I was really happy with its preformance until I tried to put my subscription music onto it. Thats when I learned that it wouldn't hold any subscription music forcing me to buy my music one by one which is costing a lot of money.  After that I started realising all of its imperfections. You can't use the FM radio in the car without hearing mostly static. You can't search through songs without actually changing the song you are listening to. Don't get me wrong, there are some good sides to this Mp3 player but I still would definately not recommend it 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 This Norelco 6843XL is made in China.  Norelco took a great razor design and components, then, must have told China to make it cheap.  So what did China do to save money on manufacturing?  It would be unbelievable, except that it's China.  They took a perfectly wonderful 2.4v cord/cordless shaver and only put one 1.2v battery in it.  This piece of junk now runs slow and boggs down on wiskers.  If you own one of these and you hate it, write Norelco and demand a refund 
 The six short subjects on this double dvd set represent, I am led to believe, the total short subject output of the great W.C. Fields. I did not expect a crystal clear video image, as these items are about 70 yrs old, although overall the quality is not that bad. Similarly, the audio track, while a bit "crackly" at times, was quite acceptable. What did make me threaten the life span of the TV, player and disc however, was the lack of sinc between the video and audio tracks. It is rather off putting to find a second or so difference between what you see "being said", and what you actually hear. You feel you are watching a poorly dubbed foreign film. The comedy is still very appealing, but this attention to fine detail on the part of the makers of the set leaves a bad taste in my mouth 
 All homeschool books that are hardcore Christian need a warning label - right on the front cover and probably on every page too.    Meaningful church involvement is a necessary ingredient for homeschool success?  I have to have a biblical conviction that God has called me to homeschool?    I guess I have to forget about homeschooling then, since neither of those apply to me.  Then she gets into curriculum and tells you to save yourself some time and settle on a traditional curriculum (if I wanted a traditional curriculum I might as well leave my kid in public school) designed for Christian or public school use.  That's great if you want a traditional curriculum.  But there are FAR more curricula out there than the Christian and traditional curricula she suggests.  And a great many kids have been successfully homeschooled using other than the "traditional" method.  Seems like she could at least have mentioned that fact.  On the last page I read before I could read no more, (which was about a third of the way in), she notes that instead of attempting to meet any state-mandated objectives, one should strive to realize God-given directives.  However let me warn you - if your state requires certain criteria such as standardized testing that you fail to do since it was not a divine directive, be sure to get a lawyer because the state will take you to court.  If she had only titled this book The Ultimate Guide to Christian Homeschooling, I think it would have been great.  All of us non-Christians would have avoided it and Christian homeschoolers would probably get a lot out of it.  There is a tremendous amount of information in it that is of value - if you approach it from a hardcore Christian point of view.  But if you DO NOT believe (as I DO NOT) that children are in desperate need of training if they are to grow up to bow their knee to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, then give this book a pass 
 Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?  Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.  Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.  
 This guy's not real, though he may write well about a very serious topic...Hollywood believes him!  If you like fiction--read Tom Brown, Jr.  If you like the real deal, there are other sources, which are far superior, though not as well written 
 What more needs to be said? Followed all instructions and yet I am now having to look for a new percolator. How exactly do companies keep making garbage products and we buy them 
 The book is comprehensive and somewhat useful as an introduction into the field. However, it has several flaws that make it fairly disappointing. The text is neither concise nor precise and some information is included that is of questionable value. (60 pages of experimental data in tabular form of thermal properties during cooling and warming of specific solutions are a waste of paper) Some sections are sloppy. For example on page 64, describing the phase diagram of water, you will find an incomplete sentence, a description that doesn't match the figure (where is the dotted line A-E?), and a very poorly drawn phase diagram (water doesn't really freeze at -15 C at 100 kPa) The author frequently uses non-SI units. A book in this price range should be properly edited and proof-read, in my opinion. This isn't, so I can't recommend it.     
 I bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock.  Money thrown away!!  The camera doesn't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk, also in my opinion. It truly is junk now as I got so frustrated with it, I threw it on the floor and smashed it.  Not kidding! When I first got it,I called Kodak and they told my son( who is knowledgeable in this stuff) how to reset the printer.  We reset it and it worked for awhile.  Then it wouldn't work any more and I did away with it.  No more Kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked 
 The text is interesting and informative. The text is short and sweet. There are examples, which is nice. That is as good as it gets.  Much of the text is based on Canned Heat, a test environment which the author claims works of Windows 2000.  This claim appears to be bogus.  I have verified that the software does not work on several perfectly healthy Windows 2000 workstations. The software does appear to work on Windows XP.  The problem is that so much of the text is based on Canned Heat, so if you can't get this to work, much of the text is not that useful.  The text begins to sound like a marketing brochure for Canned Heat.   If you go to the website, you may be dissappointed (as I was) to never receive a response.  Every form I tried returned an error message. I have verified this with other interested parties. Emails to the addresses provided have not been answered.  My best advice is to avoid "How to Break Software" and "How to Break Software Security."  For what little you get, the books are overpriced.  If the author wants his readers to take him seriously as an authority on software testing, then he should spend more time testing his own software before shipping it out. Frankly, I find it hard to take him seriously if this is the best he can do. 
 The worst book I've read (actually, I was listening to the audiobook).  The characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that I found myself YELLING at the tape player, "I KNOW, I KNOW ALREADY".  I couldn't stand the torture anymore, I didn't even finish it.  I have enjoyed some of DS's earlier work, but will not buy another 
  Well.... I'm less than impressed.I expected a reader's journey through a year of books and instead got an unwanted journey through a random collection of personal anecdotes about the author's husband, child, mother, baseball, writer friends, etc.  The fact that she made some glaring mistakes in the book was also fairly annoying. Specifically, she says Emma Donoghue's first novel was Slammerkin.... it wasn't. On the same page she says that Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace was based on the same crime.... it wasn't. I almost stopped at that point but the one reedeeming feature of the book is that it's short. 
 Dr. Lee is not an OB/Gyn.  be careful when reading this book.  Recend clinical studies are not included in this book.     Furthermore, Dr. Lee is widely disregarded by his peers 
 it's horrible.. you imagine that now you could put your TV up your wall and you get this box filled wit just 3 metal piece and bunch of screws and with a crappy instruction manuel. the instruction mannnel doesn't explain at all. it's difficult to attach the parts to your TV, it doesn't work with all kind of LCD tvs, it only works wit some specific parts of walls of your house. The only thing I could say is.. "DON'T BUY IT 
 Who would sell an r/c toy car that runs backwards continuously?  It was a big disappointment for my granddaughter.  Tyco's Lighting McQueen was greeted with glee when it was unwrapped, and found its way to the trash with the day's wrapping paper.  POS 
 This book was kind of boring, and patronizing to the people who live in Times Square. The author acts like he's disgusted with humanity. Way too cynical, and the descriptions of black people were very minstrel show 
 I bought this movie because of the "Name" Stars - They could have filmed their parts in 2 days and all Cate Blanchett had to do was lye still - no acting required. Brad Pitt's  yelling obscenities at the police and turning his back and running away was the only acting necessary. This movie is decidedly against men  - moreover it has no substantiating connectivity. For example - segments end in one type of terrain and startup again in another very hospitable type of terrain solely to play on one's political 'mind' and to further the 'idea' all men are rotten 
 I was so excited to receive my first issue of Art In America, and I was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full-page ads for galleries in Europe.  There are very few articles or artist Bios.  The photos are beautiful, but don't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about American artists or galleries 
 A Recipe for Bees reminded me a lot of the novel Vinegar Hill. In both stories, a wife is living in a dark, unpleasant home environment. In A Recipe for Bees, Augusta, an older lady, approaching the end of her life, reflects back upon her childhood and her marriage. Her mother dies at a young age, leaving her alone with an unaffectionate father. When she meets Karl and they become married, Augusta moves from one unaffectionate household to another. Living at Karl's father's farm, Augusta is only subject to more withholding of affection and is living a dark and depressing life. The rest of the novel delves into Augusta's search for independence and what she chooses to make of her life. The story takes us down journeys of the ups and downs of marriage, being a misfit in the community, and mother/daughter relationships. The main problem reading it, is that I couldn't find it in me to like the main character, Augusta. I also felt that the story left the reader with a depressed feeling of what marriage is like.  The weaving of the "bee" theme added a nice touch to the story, but if you're looking for a great read with a "bee" them, try The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd. The writing in A Recipe for Bees was good, but I felt the story was lacking something 
 The title reads: "Descartes's Secret Notebook". And those who bought this book supposedly wants information about the notebook. And what do we get? Less than 30 pages of facts about the notebook (mostly a summary of a 1987 article by Pierre Costabel) and tons of unrelated, old, and sometimes (often?) misreported facts about Descartes' life.  Wow! I've got myself a new paperweight! Thanks so much Aczel 
 As an eighties child myself, Killing Moon, Bedbugs and Ballyhoo along with a few others have a very special place in my heart. So I thought I'd venture out a little and see if there was anything else I overlooked from their era.   NOPE. I had not, and this was a waste of money.  
 I felt this was a highly disappointing and unsatisfactory book about an 8-year-old child who has autism. Kristy, the 13-year-old protagonist in this story baby sits Susan, whose autism is so severe that she does not communicate meaningfully. She has an extraordinary gift for music and can reproduce any song she hears on the piano. She does not play or interact with others.   Other kids soon learn of Susan's musical prowess and charge admission to hear her play. They exploit her talents until Kristy intervenes. Susan can also provide any given date and her mother explains that Susan once saw a perpetual calendar which sparked this interest.   Parts of the book reflected antiquated attitudes and misperceptions about autism. Kristy looks the word up in the dictionary and the definition provided was that it is a form of schizophrenia or withdrawal from reality. Autism is NOT schizophrenia and people with autism don't necessarily "withdraw from reality." Indeed, people with autism often feel bombarded with outside stimuli and develop coping mechanisms to "come even," that is to tone down the sensory onslaught that is so much a part of the autism experience. Suggesting that autism is in any way, shape and form related to schizophrenia has proved very costly to people with autism. Sadly, this kind of thing has caused many people with autism to be misdiagnosed. This in turn has led to many inappropriate treatments and placements being inflicted on people with autism! This kind of thing does not help anybody and has harmed many.   This book is not meant to be a diagnostic tool, but I wish autism had been defined in a more accurate way.  Rest assured, autism is NOT a disease but a neurobiological condition that affects sensory integration and communication based on the individual.  I for one am good and tired of seeing characters with autism being portrayed as having savant abilities. That only applies to roughly less than 10% of the autistic population and I can't help but wonder if this story just reinforces those stereotypes of people with autism to the neurotypical population. Same old tired tune, just a different performer.   To the author's credit, no promises are made. Susan is by the close of the story enrolled in a residential program for autistic children. I did feel the story was extremely weak. I also wondered why Susan was sent to a residential school as opposed to a day program in her area.   Read Ann M. Martin's "Inside Out" instead. That is a much better book by this author about a child who has autism.  At least James is a Beatles' fan 
 DuBrul is a decent enough writer to keep you engrossed in this story until its end. But aside from that, this is a very silly book that is insane in its plot contrivances. I noticed on the cover that Clive Cussler said that this was a great book, and I have to say that if I were to name one author that DuBrul reminded me of, it would be Cussler. I have a lot of problems with Cusslers books and cant help but laugh often as I turn the pages. This is my first DuBrul and if 'Deep Fire Rising' is an indicator of what all of his books are like, DuBrul is skating on an edge even way more far-fetched than the ludicrous Cussler.  Philip Mercer is James Bond from the MoonRaker variety. The places that Mercer finds himself would never ever come about. If this story were to have some relevance in reality it would have needed to break the steps that Mercer takes into a dozen characters. Aside from that, Running benieth the story is this mystical group that predicts the future. Ahh, its painful. What saves the book and allows the reader to continue from one chapter to the next is DuBrul's excellent writing skills. You can do better than this book. It's not hard to find an author more skilled at crafting a plot. I would steer you away from DuBrul if I could 
 It's such a great idea to release these shows on DVD and the packaging for these two volumes is really inventive. However, great packaging doesn't make a great DVD. The quality of the shows on these DVDs is bottom of the barrel. I am actually surprised they had the gall to release these. Literally, the picture quality of "The Pinballs" episode is, and I am not exaggerating here, the same as a third generation VHS cassette as if the show were taped off of broadcast television. Without the benefit of cable.  The extras are actually worse. The extras consist of still frames from the shows that have been blown up to fill the screen. The images are completely blown out and pixelated. I would have preferred no "extras" than something this bad.   I don't know if it is a blessing that these shows are available at all or if it is just plain insulting that this company is asking people to pay for these horrible reproductions. Overall I think this DVD is an embarrassment. What a shame 
 I haven't received this product yet and I'm pretty upset about it. I've requested that someone contact me about this problem and I haven't been given an answer.  I think I'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer.   Where is the product I bought??? 
 This was required reading for my British Literature class. It's the only novel in the class that I struggled with and only struggled from boredom. It is entirely possible that I just do not understand the genius that is Forster, but I did not enjoy this novel. A lover of Forster or Modernist writing might enjoy it more. It must be a classic for a reason. 
 I was hoping to buy an Italian food cookbook.  What I got was a cookbook about Italian "inspired"  creations that he, the author, himself created. Mostly this book seems like a pat on his back for he mentions how everyone loves this or that dish every few pages....and he is proud because he made all the recipes himself!! Not authentic to me.  Hardly any recipe contains garlic and I feel forced to doctor the recipes in order to get any flavor.  My only hope for this book is that the deserts (I haven't tried one yet) makes up for the rest.  Review addition:  OK...so the Tiramasu was VERY good.  Bought Lady Fingers at Trader Joes just to save you the effort of looking in every grocer and not finding it like I did. 
 After hearing a lot of the songs used for other Fisher Price music toys, I expected the best from this one. I liked the songs included on the rom, but I expect a nice beat and catchy tune. (Like the Backyardigans or the Doodle Bops). These songs are performed in a dry sort of way. They aren't even as good as the Wiggles and my kids hate the Wiggles. It was a bit disappointing 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  Let's start with what most know about the Chappaquiddick incident before they read this book:  Ted Kennedy was at a regatta near Chappy; he probably had too much to drink; he went to a party with former employees of his brother Bobby; he left with Mary Jo Kopechne; he drove off a bridge; he survived; she died; he delayed reporting the accident; he wasn't forthcoming about what happened; the police and the prosecutors were ineffective;  Ted Kennedy's national political aspirations ended.  After struggling through approximately four hundred pages of sometimes repetitive reading, that's all I still know.  If you want to read a book this long to come away with very little insight into what caused the accident, you've come to the right place 
 I like to find an author and read all their books, not necessarily in order. I find that I get a great liking/disliking for them and decide if I will continue. I found CC's books to be good with the first FBI book I read with Dane Carver. It was good. Damsel in distress and FBI agent friend falls in love with her and they marry all live happily ever after. Then there is the one with the detective, Ben. Guess what,  he falls in love with the damsel in distress and they get married. Then there is Mac and Quinlan, both FBI agent friends of Savich/Sherlock - they too fall madly in love with the women they are protecting/investigating and get married and live happily ever after. Now I am all for a nice romantic twist in a book but it happens in EVERY one. Don't forget the MAZE where Savich and Sherlock fall in love. I did not dislike any of those books but it did get a bit mundane when I started seeing the same outline for the plot there. A lot of the same use of dialogue and words starting popping off the page at me. Just not a lot of new material to hold the interest.   HEMLOCK BAY was just too much to take. I like the characters Savich and Sherlock - they are certainly written as superagents and superparents. I even liked Lily and Simon in this one. BUT and here the big BUT, the plot! It was just too winding, too unrealistic (not even counting the unexplained supernatural things) and just too far fetched. I was disappointed with this read. Will I read more? Well I have one more of the FBI series here to finish the whole set so yes I will. I will not recommend many of them to friends. I think CC had a great thing going and just went off on a tangent as many of the best selling authors do such as Cornwell (was my favorite until the last few books become recipe plots as well), Grafton (who I had to read five to confirm they were as bad as I had thought on the first one) and Patterson (yes even the great one has some that were actual groaners).  I read a lot - a book every day and a half is what it works out to so I buy several at one time. I just found this to be a waste of my time and very depressing that a best selling author would consider this to be up to par. The recipe is now old and needs perked up. Time to change the ingredients and spice it up 
 find an old edition of this book if the editions are similar.  The cases in it are old so the law isn't really changing so if you can tolerate not being on the exact same page in class & can deal with figuring out the different pages save your money since this text is hard to follow! the notes and problems aren't helpful 
 Hmmm .  . . How can a complete unaltered version of a book originally published in 1979 contain references to events occurring in 1993?  The only thing that made me believe that this book could have been originally written in 1979 or earlier was lack of use by the author of cut-n-paste technology, resulting in character development scattered in the strangest and most inappropriate places.  I agree that it wasn't altered - and should have been.  Why give it two stars?  Because I saved one star in case I come across a book worse than this one 
 Bought this product for my two sons ages 4 and 6.  Within the first week one of the sticks was broken.  Called the company and they sent out another one, but before it could arrive the other stick broke.  They aren't made strong enough to use.  They plastic simply cracks and totally falls apart.  We ended up throwing it out 
 Everyone I know in physics, like myself says "I don't know about the Taoism, but he doesn't have the physics quite right." Everyone I know from an Eastern Philosophy background says "I don't know about the physics, but he doesn't have the Taoism quite right."  
 Read the Unbox terms of use CAREFULLY before choosing this route over a regular DVD purchase.  It is not your usual set of "blah blah" legal jargon.  For example, 3c: "Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you."  If you ever remove the Unbox software, Amazon may revoke your ability to view the Firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine!  Amazon, I've ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience; why did you let Unbox create these anti-customer terms of use?? 
 This book should be used as firewood not to entertain or educate kids.  How did the author get it published 
 If your children play hard with toys......this definitely isn't the toy for them..   It broke the very 1st day! Threw in the garbage 
 This book is, IMHO, intellectually bankrupt.  However, it may serve as an excellent source of postmodern jargon for those who are lashing about for some tub to thump. Ironically, it does have some good primary sources in its bibliography; although, I must say, I am utterly at a loss as to how an acclaimed cultural mandarin could have, in fact, read through them all only to spout "reflexively-reflexive" gibberish for hundreds of pages!  The only theme that stands clear amid Giddens' din of twisted sentences (flecked with "socio-cultural" buzzwords), I later encountered quoted succinctly from Leo Frobenius in Joseph Campbell's Creative Mythology (Penguin Books;1976; p. 30):  "We are concerned no longer with cultural inflections," he [Frobenius] declared, "but with the passage from one culture stage to another.  In all previous ages, only restricted portions of the surface of the earth were known.  Men looked out from the narrowest, upon a somewhat larger neighborhood, and beyond that, a great unknown.  They were all, so to say, insular: bound in.  Whereas our view is confined no longer to a spot of space on the surface of this earth. It surveys the whole planet. And this fact, this lack of horizon, is something new."  Campbell's book then looks much deeper into the spiritual problems of the modern soul--and, by the way, it too has an excellent bibliography for those with a more demanding appetite 
 The author makes a good case for index mutual funds but there are too many digressions about the author's extracurricular activities. Do you really want a pumpkin pie recipe in a book about mutual funds 
 The illustrations of ECG strips were very basic and everything was in black & white. Written more like a childrens book. The topic of ECG rhthyms is a bit complex to be written this basic 
 I was very, very disappointed when the version I received did not have the entire Jon Bon Jovi sound track. That's what I wanted the DVD for as I already have 2 VHS tapes without it. Can someone tell me where I can get the Young Guns II theatrical version that has the entire Bon Jovi soundtrack 
 While I found this book to be interesting, it was hard to follow and it most definitely needs an index 
 When I was vacationing in London this past May I spotted this new Morcheeba CD at the store.  I bought it and couldn't wait to get it in the CD player.  Having only discovered this group a couple of years ago with the "Parts of the Process" compilation, I had fallen in love with the easy grooves and Skye Edwards talented, sultry voice.  (Listen to "The Sea" and then follow it up with "Undress Me Now" and you'll understand the magic in the range of her voice.)  Imagine my extreme disappointment when I heard "The Antidote."  Skye is gone, replaced my a singer with a lower register and very little range.  At times the new singer's voice grated on my nerves so much, I had to move to the next track.    The CD was a waste of money and the hour I took to listen to it is an hour I will never get back.  News reports say the new singer is already gone and will be replaced, not by Skye, but by yet another new girl.  After the brillance of the pre-"Antidote" library, I am forced to wonder:  What were the guys thinking 
 Bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error (appears like the shutter never opens) and will not record video.  Spoke with JVC and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in.  Will update my rating after I see what is wrong, if they can fix it, if they will stand behind their product.  Watch for more details.  Before it failed only complaint I had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price 
 I can't say I liked this CD.  Jessica Simpson was good when she started, but as her popularity has grown, her talents have declined.  She commited murder the day she recorded Senatra's song for "The Dukes of Hazard" movie 
 I loved most of the other books by Mr. Vinge. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for Rainbows End. The author clearly invested a lot of time in trying to figure out how the world may look like in a few tenths of years. In this, I believe he did well. The problem is, that all this insight and description (e.g., what is going to be taught in schools, the interconnectedness of the world, the superimposition of virtual to real views, etc) does not combine with a good and catching story. The first 4 pages of the book do primise something great - what unfortunately is not delivered in the rest of the book 
 I bought this sandbox for my 2 1/2 year old son, and he loves playing in the sand with it.  However, I am taking it back to the store & exchanging it for the Naturally Playful sandbox (which I was originally going to purchase, but got this one instead to save $10 - mistake).  As soon as I put the lid on it caved in the middle (of course, I already had sand in it).  Also, the lid just seems to lay on the top, and could be easily blown off.  I'm sure it won't last through many sunny days or storms so it will be going back 
 No wonder there is so little said about this award-winning Faulkner work. It is a chore to read. Only in a few passages does the reader have the sense that the writer can tell a good story. Worse than that, the  characters are like Rorschak blots with the Christian mythology mixed in.  Stick with Faulkner's southern writings for characters who remain in your  memory and images that are profound 
 A voracious reader, I seldom write reviews because one) time is too precious; two) sheer laziness; and three) ratings on reviews have more to do with whether you liked the book someone else liked, or did not like the book someone else did not like.  In short, it is not what you write but whether the reader agrees with your selection of "stars."  In the case of "Nothing But Victory," I had to get up off my lazy but and say something about my disappointment with this book.  I have read two of Woodworth's other titles.  "Jefferson Davis and His Generals" would rank among my favourite ACW titles, and it is based on Woodworth's thesis work at Rice University.  "Six Armies in Tennessee" is a fairly good piece of work, given the limitations of the series in which it belongs (which seems to put a limitation upon endnotes and supporting citations).  In "Nothing But Victory," Woodworth has written something that stands less as history, with all its warts and blemishes, and rather comes across as a piece of propaganda for Grant and the Army of the Tennessee.  In Woodworth's hands, Grant becomes the Union hero, par excellence, and the Army of the Tennessee, his chosen instrument with which to smite the Rebels and put done secession.  Woodworth frequently overstates his case, minimizes the faults of Grant and the AOT, and just plain out ignores contrary views that might smudge the image of either in this execrable piece of pseudo-history.  In order to support my opinion, I turn to Woodworth's use of supporting evidence, or the lack thereof.  In "Jefferson Davis and His Generals," Woodworth has an endnote section which runs around sixty pages for some three hundred odd pages of text.  In "Nothing But Victory," a six hundred page tome, Woodworth's endnotes cover some eighty pages (and the font of the two books is of different sizes, the Davis title being the smaller).  In his endnotes, Woodworth will support his views sometimes on the strength of one source.  And guess which source that might be: Grant's "Memoirs."  Let us take a look at the Battle of Shiloh and the question of the role of Don Carlos Buell and the Army of the Ohio: did it save the day for Grant?  On page 199, Woodworth writes that "Grant and Sherman, however, were as completely surprised as it was possible for generals to be.  They had had, in Grant's words the day before the battle, `scarely the faintest idead of an attack (general one) being made upon us."  In chapters nine and ten, the coverage of the Army of the Ohio is minimized to a few comments, and its overall role in the battle is never addressed, leaving the unstated conclusion that the Army of the Tennessee won the battle by its own efforts.  Granted, the book's primary focus is on the AOT, but this emphasis should not get in the way of a more accurate and balanced approach.  During the first day's fighting, a number of stragglers from the AOT went to the base of the bluffs at Pittsburgh's Landing.  This number can only be estimated.  Grant, in his "Memoirs," put the number at four or five thousand.  Woodworth then writes on page 184, "Later, Buell and others not particularly well disposed toward Grant would brandy about figures as large as 10,000 or even 20,000.  This number is patently absurd, but the former is probably exaggerated as well.  Eyewitnesses who had extensive opportunity to observe the crowd on the bank estimated it as closer to 5,000."  Other than an endnote for Grant's estimation from his "Memoirs," written many years after the fact, Woodworth cites no other source.    In the same paragraph, he concludes by writing, "Several pointed out the fact that the area was not very large and would not have held more than that."  Here, he does have an endnote, and on page 666, we see that "several sources" has become two.  Why exaggerate and describe two as "several"?     The "problem" is not that Woodworth is allowed to hold this views; he is.  The problem is that Woodworth ignores or lightly brushes over views to the contrary, while weakly supporting his own arguments.    For a different view on the role of Buell and the Army of Ohio at Shiloh, one can read Engel's biography of Buell, where pages 235-239 address the question, and at least is willing to examine different views with more care.  With Woodworth, even Sherman is called "the fool" (p. 157) for his lack of preparation at Shiloh, but Grant is the Teflon general, above criticism, along with his army (minus the 4,000-20,000-take your pick-- stragglers).    Further evidence of a slanted approach can be found in chapters twelve and thirteen, which deal with the battles of Iuka and Corinth respectively.  One of the sources upon whom Woodworth depends is Peter Cozzens' "The Darkest Days of the War," a book in which neither of the primary Union commanders, Grant or Rosecrans, come off in a favourable light in Cozzens' view (Cozzens has own problems with the historical facts getting in the way of his writing, but that is a review for another time).  Woodworth conveniently uses the sections criticizing Rosecrans, while ignoring those sections that question Grant's management, or mismanagement, of these battles.  Although Grant's "Memoirs" pepper the endnotes, I do not believe that any of William S. Rosecrans' writings, or those of his biographer, William Lamers, make an appearance to give a differing light on Iuka and Corinth.  More could be cited in support of my view, but life is getting in the way.  In the end, it is all a shame, really, because it is not necessary for Woodworth, or anyone else, to put Grant on a mantle of hero-worship.  Grant was perhaps the greatest Union general of the Civil War (who is going to compete with him other than maybe Sherman?).  What makes Grant great is not that he made mistakes, but that he learned from his errors.  Grant seemed more open about admitting such mistakes during the war, but by the time of the writing of his "Memoirs," his memory appeared to be more selective (once again, like with the comment on Cozzens, this opinion is stated but not supported, and as such, must be taken with the proverbial grain of salt).  Woodworth does not serve the purpose of honouring the Army of the Tennessee, or its greatest commander, Grant, by ignoring historical facts that would provide both a more accurate and more balanced view.  As a history teacher, Woodworth knows better.  I cannot understand why either his conscience, or his editor, allowed this shoddy piece of work to be published.  Grant and the AOT stand great in the history, despite Woodworth's disservice to their memories.  I paid about $1.50 for my copy, plus postage.  Already, Woodworth's book has found its worthy place in the discount section of mediocre writing.  I can only hope that in his next book, he will demonstrate the skill that was apparent in his earlier works. 
 I have never written a comment about a book, but hopefully other people will at least be warned.  This is the one of the worst books I've ever read.  I have read several Wiley books; most of them are poorly written and lacking substance.  This one is unbelievably bad.   This book deserves a negative five stars.  (Who wrote those other reviews?) If you have never read a book on trading systems, then this book is may tell you something. Otherwise, save your money.  There's nothing here 
 I wasted my money on this piece of trash that I could have written myself from a little time on Google.  It tells you only the most obvious things that one just learns along the way.  I am NOT a techie...I'm an old country lawyer, so don't think that I am coming from the perspective that I am a computer expert...I am not.  Just find something else to help you out in this area!!  It's a "rip off" 
 I began reading Forever Amber last week (hoping to find a book I might like while I waited for another one to come available at the Library) and from the first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this book.  But I am one of those readers that feels if a book is started then you should finish it.  Upon finishing it I feel cheated.    The book isn't all that bad.  There is a lot of movement, intrigue and history in it.  But I couldn't feel for the characters.  The main character, Amber, was not someone that I would like and even when things went wrong for her, I still felt that way.  I assume that no one is supposed to like her.  And although I didn't like any of the characters in this book, I guess I did feel something for Amber because I felt like she should be with Lord Carlton...up in until the last part of the book.  Then I realized that she shouldn't be with anyone.    The reason for the two stars is because of the ending.  I hated that ending.  I felt totally cheated after reading the whole 700 plus pages and then the book ending so abruptly.  I agree with others who have left reviews here, it seems that the author decided that she either didn't want to write anymore of this book or she ran out of things to write about.    Anyway, it was an okay book to keep me occupied until the book I have been waiting for becomes available but I would never recommend this book to anyone. It's really not worth the time.   I guess you either love the book or you hate it.  And I hated it. 
 Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead 
 My companion and I tried to use this book in Tokyo (since we purchased it and felt that we had to get full value).  Needless to say the maps were horrible (placements of the restaurants, hotels and sites on the maps were incorrect).  They also have the horrible habit of putting only the english names (hello!!!, we're in Japan) of the restaurants/sites/hotels in the book so when you try to find the place - you may walk past it endlessly until you ask every stranger on the street.   Unless you're going to stick to the most basic tourist areas where everything is translated for the gaijin, don't even think about this book.  On the other hand, if you like to meet strangers, this is an excellent excuse.   [Eventually we broke down and had to buy another travel guide 
 Other than the pictures I just didn't like this book at all.  It is a little to pretentious for me.  It makes one wonder about the qualifications of this Preziosi fellow 
 This Book belabors the obvious and is very light on detail oriented, usable information.  General overview is good, but you can tell that this person does not have any hands on experience with the subject matter 
 At $15.95, this is an outrageous rip-off!  The impressive-looking cover image looks like a book, but it only an envelope which contains five LEAFLETS!  They look like the attraction-folders one sees around to be picked up for free.  While the maps are clear, the points of interest listed are described in a few words or short sentences.  You'll get abundantly more information with a book of guided walks.  Don't get suckered in to this excessive price 
 Disappointed in this one. Serisouly thought I'd get something a little deeper and more actionable out of this book.  Listening skills and treating women with respect is pretty obvious, which seem to be some of the big takeaways. If you buy this book you will get common sense generalities, e.g. never underestimate a woman; I didn't need a book to tell me that 
 Well, I love listening to books on CD during my commute. Frankly, I can't decide after 4 of the 10 CDs included in this package whether I should continue to listen or not. The reader's voice -- C.J. Critt -- is really irritating. Her inflection on certain words doesn't work and the voices she uses for some of the characters are so off-putting. After being almost halfway through, I really would like to know what happened to this AP reporter/scuba diver, but I'm not sure I can handle sitting through 6 more CDs. The whole story seems amateurish, and I agree with another reviewer who said that the know-it-all aspect of the protagonist is tedious. Let's just say I wouldn't recommend it. This is the first book I've picked up from Cornwell, and I probably won't pick up any others. 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat.  The ending left me empty and unsatisfied.  If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area.  Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map 
 she was a great evil woman that had appeared in the last Qing Dynasty.  For instance: Like she still had done and used a "Death by a thousand cuts" for all prisoners for 120 years ago, China is one of the highest cultures and oldest civilizations in the world, but the chinese acted like the Barbarians. China is becoming a top record of human right violation until today.  Iam happy cause I was born in Bali not in China. 
 I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com, but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28, which makes it very unconfortable to wear. So becareful when ordering. Look at the manufacturer's sizing list (VERY SMALL LETTERS) to find the right size. By the way, I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer's sizing chart.  Not a happy camper 
 The author of this book was obviously not applying "emotional intelligence" principles when writing this book.  The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner.  I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible.  It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing?  Just know that to be successful, you HAVE to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive, kind and generally good person to work with. If you don't believe me, save yourself the time/energy and buy the Cliffs notes 
 Ghosting and static all day, every day. If you need a replacement cable, find one with better shielding

 This book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe the Warren Commission. Posner saw an opportunity to take their money, and he took it. Good for him. I'm sure if there was a sizable market of people wanting to believe OJ was innocent, he'd write that book too, with all sorts of convincing "scientific" evidence. Take a look at Weisberg's Case Open, if you can find it , for documentation of some of Posner's more amusing misrepresentations.   
 Two things about this book are depressing. First, the author has no patience or self-discipline, and thus cannot possibly learn to play piano well. So why does he go on this "quest" to obtain an expensive piano? The real reason, which goes unsaid but runs as a sad subtext through the book, is that it is easy for the author, who has money, to spend that money on a piano, and the satisfaction of owning the piano serves him as a substitute for the satisfaction that would be gained from learning to play it. The second reason this book is depressing is a quality that this book happens to share with countless "personal journey" memoirs that are coming out these days. It is that the author does not have the discipline, education or interest to write a serious work of non-fiction about pianos, piano manufacture or piano playing, and so turns to the much abused memoir format to squeeze a book out of what are, ultimately, mundane experiences, shallow insights and personal challenges that are ultimately abandoned 
 For the most part, the author seems to have pretty  good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the  book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus  indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs.  Problem: no  tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and  a half after the writing. Aside from that and a few other points, though,  the book is good reading 
 What a waste of money. I bought this for my wife and there is nothing good to say about it. It's so big that she has to hold it up to keep the string touching her body. The "bubbles" get stuck between the cheeks, and she says it does absolutely nothing for her where it's supposed to. She said that it was actually irritating to wear. Don't waste your money on this 
 I've seen cheesy and I've seen wannabe with the difference between the two being the level pandering to a more intelligent audience. This movie is definitely for guys that like to get their Shakespeare from WWF. Schwarzenegger's best movie will ever be Terminator. If he could have ended with the classic "I'll be back" and not really come back to make any number of horrid films we might actually have some decent science fiction. Last good science fiction I saw was Gattaca. Total Recall definitely ain't science fiction and isn't even very good action as compared with say the mindless gore of predator. Now that was action you could taste and you knew there wasn't much pretense of science fiction going on. I'd give Total Recall a 0 or less but they only let me enter a 1 
 This is an attractive book: good quality paper and pretty pictures, but there are many other cookbooks that really deliver the goods.  If you think this is a cookbook to spice-up the bedroom, then the answer is "maybe."  If you want to use this to get some good recipes, the answer is "no."  And if you want to buy this to look at the pictures, then the answer is "you can do better."  Don't be fooled by the title - there are other consumer goods that have been sold by sex in the past 
 I had high hopes for this, expecting a bigger dose of Maureen's refreshing liberal arguments and interesting points.  No such luck.  It's hard to start the analysis considering how she jumps from point to point throughout the book and throughout each chapter.  You'd think the title might give it focus, but that very question doesn't even come up until the mid-point of the book (about where I am now; not sure I have the will to finish), and her wittest method of answering it is some cutesy tangent about genetics and how sperm is no longer necessary to fertilize eggs.  harharhar.  Up until that point, it's mostly a collection of random rants and anecdotes about how men supposedly can't handle women who are smarter than them or make more money, etc.  Also, that all these societal standards are the fault of men, completely omitting women's responsibility in upholding them.  (Get a clue: women are at least as insistent on the man being richer or more powerful no matter her standing, just like women expect the man to be taller no matter her height.)  If Maureen truly believes men desire ditzes, maybe she can find comfort in knowing the release of this book just increased her compatibility 
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 This movie was so bad (How Bad Was It?) that I turned it off after about 25 minutes. This is only the second time in my life I stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 TV tuner card was sent and received as stated by the seller.  The TV card however did not work on our laptop (IBM Thinkpad A41p) but worked just fine in a laptop of a different manufacturer.  Had to use AVerMedia website to get resolution of problem but gave up when we realized the process was going to take forever.  Sold it to person who got it to work on their laptop and we just bought a LCD TV 
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 The whole book feels like a promotion for Holodeck tool. Some of the chapters are very straightforward: boot your AUT (Application Under Test) from Holodeck and see what happens. However, the version of the tool supplied with the book isn't supported by anybody and, sure enough, it doesn't work with my AUT. The supported one is above $1K for single user licence... Though as much as I appreciate the general ideas about blackbox security testing Whittaker is voicing in this book, I feel it's just not enough there for its price. : 
 I thought this book was dull and disappointing.  If you are looking for just a bit of light reading for the sake of a story, this may be the book for you - but if you are looking for a novel that is intriguing, moving and involving, this certainly didn't make the grade for me.  The writing is dull, the characters are flat, the plot moves along like a simplistic fantasy with the characters making their choices with an unrealistically shallow level of conflict.  I personally found I was unable to empathise with any of them because I felt they just weren't real to me, despite the book's issues being quite close to my heart.  It's magazine-rack stuff 
 This dictionary may be good for the layman, but it is far too general for a law student or lawyer.  Only the most common legal words are included, so most of the words are familiar to lawyers.  Those words that are obscure enough to require a dictionary are not included.  I would recommend this dictionary to a layman who wants to understand simple legal terms, but not to a lawyer or law student 
 I was expecting accurate information regarding the history of Christmas songs and carols. Instead, Ace Collins has taken some facts about the carols and woven fairytales around them. In some cases he has taken a few facts and assumed results that are erroneous.   Having personally researched "Silent Night" in Austria, I can say for certain that Collins has presented another fanciful story based on some facts and some misconceptions about the world's best-loved carol.   The tale about "The Twelve Days of Christmas" being a secret catechism for Catholics in the period when they were oppressed in England doesn't make any sense. The "secret" Catholic beliefs it supposedly hides are identical to the Protestant beliefs of that era. Therefore there was no reason to keep them secret from Protestants -- 1 =  one God, 2 = Old and New Testament, 3 = gold, frankincense, and myrrh -- and so on.   Sadly, it's just another feel-good Christmas book when it could have been a valuable resource for people wanting accurate information.  
 Jackies wild Seattle is a adventure story about two kids that stay with their uncle in the summer in Seattle,Washington. Cody, Shannon, uncle Neal and they save animals. The two kids are the many caracters  Cody and Shannon. Cody is the one saving all the animals. Shannon is the one woring about her parents. The plot of the book is that uncle Neal gets unjured and shannon has to save uncle Neal. On the way cody is the one saving all the animals. the authors styles is that he likes wrighting adventure books and the themes are that they save many animals and save their uncle. Its mostly sad range and the book is sick sometimes and also sad. I havent read a book related to the book. the book was a good adventure book I liked it. I didnt like that he saved a lot of bloody animals it was sick. the tipe of reader that would like this book is a person that is into adventure books.     
 Bad pictures. Not enough about his death. Nat Hentoff continues to prove that he can't write. Boring. Greatly exaggerates Bix's influence on the world of jazz. Don't pay for this, pull an Abbie Hoffman 
 When I saw this in theatres, I was thinking the whole time I HAVE to get THIS soundtrack, these were some seriously bumpin tracks! Of course I didnt' know the names of the songs in the movie, so I just assumed they'd all be on the CD.  WRONG!   Its just a B2K album with some other sorry noname 'artists' doing bad slow jams 
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 Player's Handbook II is a waste of time and money.  It is a disappointing mish mash of lame executions of potentially interesting concepts 
 Great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it's free - but not worth your money to own. I bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here. Oh, once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine, but not consistently. The home section isn't that inspirational either. Go for it if it's free, but if it's not, don't buy it 
 The topic is an interesting one and I give the author credit for trying to pick out key themes across a very broad and complicated landscape.  However, I found the book frustrating and annoying in a number of ways.  Most importantly, the book never manges to find and develop a theme; it seems to meander from topic to topic. In addition, the author is far too enamored of simple computer models and spends too much timing belaboring how they work, their iterations and marveling at how, with the right inputs, they can show outputs similar to what is observed in real life.  In addition, much of what appears to be the point of the book hinges on the assumption that the extinction of a species is a failure similar to a company ceasing to be a separate stand-alone entity.  However, firms disappear for many reasons other than bankruptcy - for example, I don't think the stockholders and employees of Pixar thought it a failure when it was acquired by Disney.   Less significantly, while Macbeth is a great play and Evelyn Waugh a great novelist his attempt to weave his many literary loves into his theory is awkward and clumsy.  He also touches on interesting topics (the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, the pros and cons of monopolies, evolution, the introduction of New Coke, the correct strategy for playing The Price is Right) but only provides superficial commentary that is very unsatisfying.  Finally, he has a habit of stating the obvious as if he has made a great discovery (two car company representatives expressed great confidence in how their product lines would perform but the third said the outcome would depend on how costumers liked the product - could it be possible that companies aren't certain about the outcomes of their actions?  Could it be that companies must make decisions and those decisions could turn out to be bad decisions?  Should Paul Ormerod give his acceptance speech in Swedish, or would English be acceptable? 
 This product would be excellent but runs fully 4" too narrow and 3" too short.  This creates an aprox. 2" lip around the entire matress. Very odd. This short coming disturbs the experience substantially. The laminated back works well. Be sure to purchase the product sized for a bed size larger than the one you own and it should be fine 
 For the price I paid for the sheets and comfortor, I could have gotten a really nice set at the store.  The sheets are see through and rough, the blanket is nothing but a cheap piece of foam with some fabric sewn around it.  I am very very dissapointed.  The company made a big big buck off of me with this set.  never again.  They must have made a 60 dollar profit, because what they sent me looks like it only cost 5 dollars to make 
 "Scribes of Life" is at best a mediocre album. The production is not what people are hyping it up to be(Dr. J is a producer now.... come on!!!). The themes of the songs are so cliche, it seems like you are listening to an old school record. The lyrics... I don't really have to comment. His only claim to fame is appearing on Cannibus' album. Yeah, that's something to brag about. BOTTOM LINE: Don't buy it 
 If you suffer from a digestive disorder (mine include IBS and ulcerative colitis) you are desperate for a cure. This book has about 100 "cures" but none of them work. If they did everyone would be cured. Most people with GI disorders try everything possible because the medical profession simply doesn't have any answers other than surgery. I myself have tried about 15 different "cures" this book offers.Nothing worked.  I bought this book but don't reccomend that anyone else do so. If you want to read it, take it out of your library 
 Not enough basic recipes and not enough information.  I returned this title, it just didn't appeal to me.  If you want some more intricate recipes and some great basic convection oven info - try "The Best Convection Oven Cookbook".  Personally, I'd like to see some one write a book with roasting times, chocolate chip cookie recipes and more of the basics 
 Not to put too fine a point on it but this book is DRY - almost like a text book.  There is very little action and/or suspense brought forth about involvement in the Angola operation and what could have been was quickly blunted with operational and bureaucratic detail.  And that's how the book drags on, with excruciating detail. In one part, Mr. Stockwell describes what he did to finally get a desk to work from at Langley by sitting in the hall in everyone's way and stacking his papers up beside him.  What took him pages to describe should've been done in a simple paragraph.  To be fair, the book is written from the viewpoint of an intelligence staffer not a cloak and dagger operative. Yes, there might be some interest in how inefficient the CIA was operating back in the mid-1970s but that's true for most large government organizations. He also describes some of the "political" machinations between officials within the CIA.  Again, mildly interesting but nothing notable. Some of the descriptions of dialog and reactions of persons seems contrived, almost as if he (or some ghost writer) added these things for effect. It almost "reads" like a fiction novel in that respect. Rather than writing a solid, crisp account with thoughtful and concise opinions about CIA policy and inner workings the book devolves often times into monotonous detail. However, in the latter chapters the account does get more interesting as he discusses "plausible deniability" and the deception of the CIA to "hide" their involvement. One of the more interesting parts is the organizational background and resources needed to run an operation of this type including the shipping of weapons and ammo, the propaganda strategy, the political workings thru committees, the State Department and the President to gain support, etc.  The book does makes one wonder what other rebellions or conflicts the CIA was involved in over the last 30-40 years and is an eye opener about our nations espionage policies. On this level, the book succeeds.  But, in the end the book was almost a grind to finish.  I'd only recommend this one for the hard core 'spook' fan 
 This video tape works, but it is basically a clip of people doing a different exercise each, all pasted together to make a full workout.  I still think the moves work, but I'd rather follow along with someone doing a full workout with me 
 I bought this book to help me plan my first trip to Maine.  I plan to return it tomorrow.  The majority of this book is lists of hotels and restaurants.  There are lots of activities and sights listed as well.  The problem is that the author does not distinguish between any of them.  Every place is just listed with a short description. It is impossible for someone like me, who has never been to Maine, to determine which parts of Maine I should visit and what I should do while I'm there.  I am a frequent traveller, and I have never seen a worse tour book 
 Thought I'd try this tea.  Wrong choice.  Tea is not as good as Numi's Iron Goddess of Mercy Oolong tea.  Perhaps my favorite Oolong. Shipping costs almost as much as the tea on the Natural Chinese Wuyi Oolong.  I'll stay with Numi Tea from now on 
 Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results. Because of this, the problems at the end of each chapter become exercises in tedium, as more time is spent searching for the necessary theorems in the text than in actually working out the solution.   I do not recommend 
 I don't own this specific APC product, but I do own other APC products.  My home was hit by lightning on July 2, 2004 during a severe lightning storm. Both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate NET3 power line surge protectors made by APC.  NET3 surge protectors offer the best ($50,000) damaged equipment warranty that APC offers. APC refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination, the surge protectors are functioning properly (I had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs).  I will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike, but the APC warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs.  I now do not recommend APC equipment, since their warranty is worthless 
 I got Front Page at a discount (quote unquote) - no expensive packaging AND no booklet.  I have some experience with the programming world but was lost and knew I needed help.  This was the first (and worst) place to turn.  Like another reviewer, my wife thought this was just what I wanted...and at first I did too.  But the presentation was jumpy and worse, it seemed as if the author were addressing a room of Microsoft business folks. Many of the explanations were of the obvious, particularly the review of all the menus.  Why not put these in an appendix for later perusal?  I was not looking for the dumbed-down Idiots series but I did need something that this did not fulfill.  After much searching I found just the one and now am ready to go "on line" with my new site 
 No matter how popular you are, there is no candidate so far on any country's election day who dares to put the voters and supporters behind and goes to the countryside to ride a horse. Nobody could do this except the guy in this novel. As a political figure such as an US Congressman, you are always surrounded by lot of people, aides, rallies, reporters...and no matter how popular you are, you definitely wouldn't dare to ride a horse in Texas countryside on an election day if you are one of the two candidates. Because 1)you have to vote for yourself first and taking pictures; 2)you have to be interviewed by reporters; 3) you have to stay at the campaign headquarters to show your gratitude that you really care of the outcome, no matter how popular you are. The highly unlikely premise of this book is an Achilles's Heel doomed to be fatal. That's why I have suggested publishers in Taiwan not to purchase this book's tranlation right, because it even failed to establish itself from the very beginnin 
 I picked up this book expecting a mystery, and I was sorely disappointed.  While I enjoyed the characters and the setting, and even the body of the plot, the ending was terrible!  It felt like the author got tired of writing the book and just... stopped.  It makes me wonder if the author knew the answer to any of the mysteries at all 
 I'm not sure who these people are that are rating this book so highly. This is probably the worst book written on the subject. Want to know how to implement a Tracking Service? How about a persistence service? Maybe you'd like to see a simple example of how to implement workflow? Well if so, then DON'T get this book. This book tells you none of this. This book is about what's under the hood. It's similar to seeing what's under the hood of IIS or Exchange. Who cares? I want to know how to use it, not how pretty the system is. I would return this book in an instant if I could.   
 As a person who's studied the Amish for many years I was really looking forward to reading this book. I'm halfway through and have decided to write my review already.  This book is not so much about the abuse and misdeeds of the Amish as much as it seems to be a confessional of abuse and misdeeds of the author.   I'll tell you right off the bat that there's a lot of animal abuse in this book, so if that upsets you (it does me) then don't read it. The majority of the abuse comes from the author to the animals when he does things he shouldn't as a young boy and gets reprimanded for them. As a result he takes it out on various animals. I was disgusted, sickened and almost in tears at some of it.  There is some other abuse...mostly by children to other children. What the author terms "abuse" is what alot of the rest of us endure growing up as well...being reprimanded by parents or stern relatives. He makes child abuse in this country pale by comparison. My thinking is that if this author had grown up among the "Englische" (what the Amish call the rest of us) that he would have written this book anyway. The author seems like an cry baby opportunist eager for a venue.  As much as I really was looking forward to reading this book, I'm sorely disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, especially not animal lovers.  Judge for yourself but I suggest you save your money and buy a book that's worth reading 
 You would be WAY better off just getting a book or pamplet from the National Park ranger station. There's very little information here, just stretched out over the length of a book. It's basically a Maine guide that they've repackaged as an Acadia guide. Here's a couple examples of the lame reporting that went into this book: They tell you how in some little local restaurants you might find the menu on a chalkboard and you should order from that. Oh, really???? Wow, never would have figured that out on my own. They try to throw a bone to the crowd that travels with dogs, but clearly they've never done so themselves. So they tell you that the local pet store carries a list of boarding facilities. So let's get this straight: I  spend all kinds of extra time and money getting my dog to a national park, only to board my dog??? The same pet store passes out a list of dog friendly restaurants, something people might actually want to know. But you won't find that out in this lame book 
 Levitas' book is well written and documented but it doesn't contain much that is new.  I've been reading about the radical right for almost 20 years now and there were no surprises here, only a rewritten version of what is in about 20 other books and reports.  The subject has been exhausted and this book proves it 
 This is such a waste of talent.  It was only published because Shiley Hazzard has written a better book.  The story was dull, the unkindness of the parents most unreasonable. What kind of people would ignore their children this way?  Depressing and a waste of time 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 This book was rather fun to read but I am not convinced that the authors have as deep an understanding of the phenomena they are writing about as they would like the readers to believe.  The book reads like a narrative, full of assertions that are not backed by rigorous analysis of hard evidence.  The authors do not critically explore causal relationships, nor do they talk about research that has done so.  They present only one particular perspective on the unfolding of events, and they do not defend this perspective against potential criticism.  My experience with economics has always reinforced the idea that causality can be difficult to establish, and can often operate in unexpected ways.  An economist must proceed skeptically, being careful to explore alternative explanations and being prepared to defend assertions with theory and data.  The authors do not seem to share this view, taking instead a more naive approach.  Maybe I was expecting too much; after all this book is meant to be accessible to non-economists.  However, making a book more accessible does not necessitate a lack of rigour or the absence of critical thought; the authors could have removed some of the redundancy in the book (their writing is far from concise!) and replaced it with explorations of alternative perspectives.  The book would be greatly enriched by adding more discussion of research that supports (or opposes) their views 
 This book appears to get rather good reviews from nearly everyone, save for science fiction fans. I expect the reason for this is that fans of science fiction are used to seeing their grand themes - eg., "the end of the world" - worked over with far more skill and subtlty that what Margaret Atwood gives us in Oryx and Crake. It's not a badly-written book, just rather unoriginal and dull.  The novel is a collection of science-fiction cliches, and the motivation of the young scientist Crake for destroying the world - jealousy over a woman - is not terribly clever or unique. In keeping with Margaret Atwood's feminist perspectives, perhaps, but nothing new.  Although Atwood is writing what is technically termed speculative fiction, her ideas boarder on science fiction, and her developements have all been chewed over before in one way or another, by authors with a great deal more originality in this particular area. If one is going to write in a field of fiction, at least do it with a bit of believabilty and uniqueness.  Even her characters, so well developed usually, can be rather flat. Snowman, for example, is nothing more than a cardboard cutout of a human being, flat as a piece of paper. The motivations of Oryx sleeping with Snowman are never fully explained, other than when Oryx claims that he is "her fun." This statement, I suppose, is designed to show how superior and subtle women in general are, and conversely, I suppose, just how terribly clever this author is. I am not impressed. If you is going to have your characters run amok, at least provide a credible explanation.  I thought that one of the roles of speculative fiction is to examine the unique responses of human beings under extraordinary situations and pressures. Therefore, it is a mystery to me why cardboard characters should appear in something like Oryx and Crake, along with virtually every science fiction cliche in the book: dystopia meets world overrun by designer viruses meets mad scientist with emotional problems. This is the kind of thing that only rank amateurs in the field unsually write, and I am profoundly shocked that this book never moves beyond those. The very USE of such cliches makes believable character developement a questionable endeavour to say the least.    I understand the novel's point, of course - that no matter how brilliant and insightful humans become, we are all still human. We are all vulnerable to the same mortal foibles. However, it's not a terribly orginal or profound point anymore, and has been worked over many times before. Star Trek comes to mind - a walking, living cliche in itself.  Atwood seems late to the speculative/science fiction game, appearing slow to pick up on these well-worn cliches, and the future does not bode well. It takes time to develope a feel for a field, to develope a philosophy of what has already been done and what has not, and that takes years. Atwood, seemingly, has many years to go.  All said, this novel will no doubt appeal to readers of fiction in general. The prose is servicable, and it gets the job done. The novel however, falters as good fiction, due to some shoddy character developement and a seeming reliance on cliches, and science fiction fans will probably find themselves feeling like they've seen it all before, only better.   I must confess that as a science fiction reader, I deal with high originality and, despite the rumours to the contrary, profound character developement on a day-to-day basis, and I found myself unchallenged and mostly bored reading this book. It could have been so much better than it was. For a truly terrifying "end of the world novel," read "Day of the Trifids," by John Wyndham. It will haunt you, and the characters will arouse your sympathy. Terrifying, sad and Earth-shattering. A masterpiece. 
 the very thesis of this book is disturbing, and added with the fact that some people are ignorant enough to believe it is just shocking.  my grandparents are survivors of Auschwitz and have the tatoos to prove it, they lived through the nightmare along with many many others- including elie wiesel, who wrote/spoke extensively about his experiences at the hands of the nazis.  that anyone would actually believe this anti-genocidal propoganda is beyond me, should we next begin to disbelieve that the rwandan genocide happened? what about pol pots slaughter of millions?  this book is not worth any history teachers-such as myself- time, no matter how much you want to look at all sides of the picture to paint an authentic historical scene for your students.  
 The worst book ever written about the Middle East is probably Joan Peters' From Time Immemorial; in this book Alan Dershowitz not only attempts to usurp that dubious honor from Peters, he also heavily plagiarizes half her book in order to do so.  The man who has made a career and a fortune as a lawyer mastering the art of defending and exonerating the guilty turns his gaze onto one of the international community's leading delinquents and most prolific violators of International Human Rights Law, International Humanitarian Law and UN Resolutions.  His defending of nation states, however, is as unconvincing as his knowledge of historical events is laughable.  Joan Peters' book was completely demolished and shown to be a fraud by Norman Finkelstein, and even the most ardent of Zionists have openly admitted the book is worthless.  20 years after that book faded into oblivion, Alan Dershowitz plagiarized much of its nonsensical arguments to masquerade as a book of his own.  For a full documentation of this plagiarism, see Norman Finkelstein's personal website.  By writing this book, Dershowitz has inflicted more damage on Israel than a thousand books criticizing it ever could.  Any neutral who would read this book would realize how shoddy The Case for Israel really is; both the book and the `case' that Dershowitz presents are nothing more than a pathetic assortment of lies, bigoted arguments, idiocies, misrepresentations and highly elaborate intellectual scams. 
 While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous.  While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read.  It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe.  Even the school principal lacked some Ooommmph if you know what I mean.  The grandmother was a good role, but the parents coud have been much more important.  So overall, let's call it a quick read, funny and enjoyable, but not one of his best.  I picked it up at the airport and read it on the very same trip.  Not one I would keep, so back it went with the 50% return offer the airport here has 
 The ideas in this book are almost laughable.  The projects that are shown wouldn't even look good with different fabrics.  If you are into lots of ruffles and pouffy things everywhere, then this is for you.  If you are into simpler window treatments with exquisite fabrics that complement a room, this isn't for you 
   It is difficult for me to avoid the clich of saying I feel ripped off by Fraud, so I'll just get writing that out of the way right off the bat. Looking over the other reviews here, I don't understand how more readers don't feel the same way.  Writer David Rakoff's collection of essays leaves a taste of disappointment in my mouth that won't go away, made worse by the fact that he makes it clear he could do so much better. There's no doubt that he's a talented writer with a great feel for words -- albeit unusually large ones -- and a keen eye for the absurd. He's lived a very interesting life, full of improbable events and unforgettable personalities. I'd probably even consider reading another of his books. But I honestly hope to never crack open Fraud again.  I think Mr. Rakoff seriously overestimated how interested the world is in his internal anguish, his bitter naval gazing, and the way he looks down his nose at the rest of us. The book is needlessly complicated, packed with obscure references and unnecessary 50-cent words. And because of the combination of those factors, the book doesn't ever really gel: it's as if Mr. Rakoff is trying to appear cleverly and profoundly self-deprecating, but with a superiority complex. I don't think it can be done, yet Mr. Rakoff tries time and time again.  It's tempting to think that Fraud's weaknesses could have been fixed by the right editor, but the more I think about it the less convinced I am that such a person exists. I now think Mr. Rakoff would be better off starting over and this time repeating to himself another clich as he starts each page: "keep it simple, stupid. 
 This book fails both as a history or analysis of Yugoslav politics or as a critical biography of Tito. The first few chapters, which contain an overly compressed "historical" review of the South Slavs from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century, contain factual, spelling and interpretative errors so obtrusive and atrocious that they are almost laughable. For example, West claims that the leader of the 1573 Croat peasant revolt was "Donja Stubica" - that was actually the name of the village in which it started. He claims that in 1871 the Croat revolutionary Eugen Kvaternik led an "armed assault on the Serbs," when in fact Kvaternik launched a foolishly bold uprising against the Habsburg Monarchy while many of his fellow rebels were themselves Serbs. He persistently misspells the surname of the great Serbian linguist and writer Vuk Karadzic as `Karadjic' - and there are literally dozens of similar mistakes that riddle the entire text. West basically argues that the problems in Yugoslavia are directly tied to historical events and religious schisms that occurred during the Middle Ages, and reduces the wars which ensued after Yugoslavia's collapse to religious conflicts. He also insists that there are no national nor even ethnic differences between the Serbs, Croats or Bosnian Muslims; rather, he says they are all the same ethnic group with three different religions, thus demonstrating his glaring ignorance of the differences between `nation' and `ethnicity,' among other things. He focuses extensive attention and invective, perhaps rightfully, to the WW2 Croatian Ustasha regime and the often scurrilous role of the Croatian Catholic Church during this period. On the other hand, he downplays or denies the much less extensive but often quite brutal crimes of the Serbian Chetniks during the same period - even to the point of making the ludicrous claim that the Serbian Orthodox Church was "never clearly associated with Great Serb nationalism or with the Chetniks." One of the main flaws of this book is that its primary focus is on World War II - the implication being that this period crucially influenced events in the 1990s. This is only true to a certain extent, but oversimplifies and greatly downplays the even more vital 40+ ensuing years. In fact, at times this book rather eerily resembles texts often seen in Croatian and Serbian newspapers during the late 1980s and early 1990s which speak of events from 50, 150 or even 500 years ago as though they happened yesterday. West's ignorance and lack of objectivity also leads him to (rather outrageously) twice refer to the Kosovo Albanians as `Shiptars' - among non-Albanians, this is a racial epithet, not a neutral descriptive term. Tito, the central figure in this book, fares little better. Although West has a nostalgically favorable view of Tito, he offers no new insights into Yugoslavia's long-time president and strongman, only the reworded observations and conclusions from other biographies, memoirs and histories, both favorable and critical. Often he provides details on completely trivial matters from Tito's life, at one point even citing actor Richard Burton's impressions of Tito and his wife. Aside from a few mildly engaging anecdotes taken from his own travels in Yugoslavia, there is little of interest here. Reading West's book is a colossal waste of time; my recommendation is for readers to check it out of a library, peruse the photographs and then go straight to the bibliography to find more worthwhile books to read on Tito, WW2 and the Ustasha terror and the former Yugoslavia in general 
 I am not a Henry James fanatic, as a matter of fact, this is the first work of his that I have read, and with that I must say that this novel is horribly written and completely unrealistic in it's portrayal of the child, Maisie and especially her dialogue. I have been assigned to read this for an english class as an undergrad and I have tolerated many a badly executed idea...but never like this. Boring, boring, and more boring. And as a result, I am comnpletely turned off to James other works. I hear his other works are great.....read those first, you may fair better 
 I bought this book thinking it was going to teach me how to model a Female Character...I WAS DEAD WRONG!!This book DOES NOT teach anything about modeling,the only thing it says to do is create a box and extrude following the sketch outline.The programs covered in this book are mainly Poser(50%) Maya(15%) and Photoshop(35%)..They should call this book "How to pose and texture a character in Poser" because that is really all this book tells you to do..But if you want a book full of pictures of nude 3D Models then by all means buy this book. 
 This company never ceases to amaze me with the trinkets they come out with to fleace your wallet. This is one of those products you will see to buy at his free millionaire mind seminar if you can not afford to buy his $2000-$17000 seminars (see peakpotentialstraining.blogspot.com for info) 
 Back in Mid-November of 2005, I tried to buy this title and for some odd reason the computer/router whatever it was wasn't able to find my address and ended up not sending me a copy though I can't complain because I did get my money back. It's puzzling to have this kind of experience. I wasn't foreign to buying things from Amazon. But now after reading several reviews I guess I should be grateful not to get one because it sounds like this particular package might be a total waste of time and money.  I love the Beatles for many reason but I'm not likely to pay 60 bucks on Ebay for the special MPI version. I might however wait for a better version that is sold at a reasonable price if Miramax or whatever studio decides to re-release A Hard Day's Night on DVD.  I hope this is helpful or atleast inciteful 
 The part about the plain soldiers of the revolutionary war being dealt with so much in detail is boring and tedious. Better to have written about the founding fathers of the US Army who were at least colonels in the army's birth. 
 I enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy. However, this third book needs some serious time in the Intensive Book Surgery Unit before it should have even been published. Frankly, this manuscript should have been kicked back from the editor to the author and refused. I realize that's a pretty heavy thing to say, but it's true. Something went badly wrong here.  The author did not do his job in bringing his protagonists to closure; having two kids fall in love, then decide to live apart for the rest of their lives is a complete crock. Puhleaze. I grew to rather like the aeronaut Texan and the explorer, and they're killed to little point. Puhleaze. Iorek the Bear is darn cool, and he barely (sorry) makes an appearance in book 3. Puhleaze. And, by the way, who is Mary, introduced so late in the trilogy, as an underfunded Dark Matter physicist (who just happens to be ... an ex-nun ... now, just wait a minute here, is that heavy handed or what?)... and Dark Matter would be *under* funded? Puhleaze. (Although these days, she'd be working on Global Warming.) And Mrs. Coulter, in a lifetime full of being evil, suddenly has a turn of heart (yes, just like The Grinch), and, in her new fullsome of goodness, helps kill an angel. Huh? What? Say that again?     I was thrilled (not) at Pullman's description of an endless, boring ... [come to think of it, very much like reading Volume III of this trilogy] ... somewhat-Purgatory-Without-Dante's-Skill that apparently is his vision of death. Everyone stands around being ... boring. Gosh, how exciting, what a vision, et cetera. It's duller than the endless views of the Enterprise in Star Trek I. It's more boring than the endless endless views of the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey. When the dead people standing around there are given the chance to decompose, they go for the gusto. As to why any of this should be in a book, I can only offer my puzzlement.       Jerry Pournelle once gave me some terrific advice. "Never give a reader a chance to put down one of your books, because if you do, they will, and they'll never pick it up again.". I zoomed non-stop through the first two books of this trilogy. The last book took me a week plus and I was extremely annoyed with it.   I was amused that Philip Pullman, in his Afterword, gives credit to stealing his ideas (those are his words) from Paradise Lost (John Milton). Frankly, I wish he had stolen more, this book would have been better. His utter hatred of The Church shines through this book. He has sort of an Idiot's Guide to Quantum Mechanics but isn't up on it.     This mess needs to be storyboarded, and everything that does not PROMOTE THE STORY needs to be chucked out. And that's about half of this book. Whoever edited this book badly needs to be chewed out. I suspect, though, that it boiled down to "not enough time to fix" in the publishing schedule; Del Rey is not noted for publishing messes like this.  
 I have never read anything so poorly written before.   This "book" is a waste of time and of paper 
 I cannot believe the high marks for this book. This book purports to be a management manual and a historical view of Alexander's life. It is quite mediocre on both fronts. The historical side is full of inaccuracies and the management side is far too simplistic to have any real value. If one is interested in reading about Alexander's military genius I would recommend The Generalship of Alexander the Great J.F.C. FULLER 
 A biography?  Not really, she compares Nancy Mitford's life with those of Nancy's fictional characters.  Often boring, when she does write about Nancy, its very good.  Too much symbolism in this book. She assumes we read all of the Mitford books.    Disappointing for true bio readers 
 The basic idea of this book is that problems in marital relationships are caused by childhood psychological wounds.  Those wounds are unconscious, but, according to the author, we all had them.  Many of the exercises (e.g., listening exercises) would be helpful, but they are basic, and many of them are not really based on the theory.  The author says repeatedly that we were "whole" humans in the womb, but we were damaged as children, and we need a healthy marriage to make us whole again.  Some of the examples in the book reveal a patriarchal mindset.  For example, in the section about "rewriting scripts" for arguments that a couple has repeatedly, the author suggests two alternatives that give the man what he wants, but no options for giving the woman what she wants.  But if I object to that, I suppose that it must be because I was wounded as a child 
 I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT. (... 
 The following were the problems: 1. Bent fender - poor packaging 2. Sratches in paint in several areas 3. Three nuts were missing 4. The front wheel hub had lateral play - cannot be fixed Planning to return cycle if amazon accepts it 
 I'm not even going to waste time reviewing this. T Pain only had two hits. Download those two and be don 
 In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.  Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this).  That's the book.   This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.  As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism 
 The positive reviewers are mousy especially Akon. Akon was never heard of until last year when it was his debut. What corporate buisness today is giving out the free record deals (as everyone intelligent says) and pick strangers from out of the street, dress them up, don't have the inspiration of writing their songs by themselves, and is a get-cash-quick scheme? MTV. I have more than the rights to say that this album that everyone you see that will love this, has a possible chance that their IQ is lower than average. We can't stop this madness. It was too late when MTV Networks (Independent MTV) sold to Viacom.  Regarding to Akon's first album, I have heard the song 'Lonely', only that Bobby Vinton should sue him for speeding up the pitch of Vinton's classic track 'Mr. Lonely'. Vinton doesn't deserve the ignorancy correlation that nobody that was born after Vinton's time haven't known 'Mr. Lonely'. He should sue, and I hope and pray to God this will get Akon's career to the incinerator, and to black ashes.  If your personality is the antonym of the word 'mind-lacking', then you should not buy this album like me. But, the people today on planet Earth are estimated 68% ignorant! It's up to our duty to reduce the percantage of ignorancy, and not to fall blindly into MTV. All in favour? AYE! All opposed? (dead silence).  As to my intelligence, I like music that isn't mainstream today. Listen to all the genrés that don't influence money 
 I just got this book and I'm very disappointed; even thought, I haven't prepared a thing. There is some picture but it doesn't reference the name of the food that's in the picture. How do I suppose to know the recipes of the food that's in the picture? For most of the pages, it doesn't have a picture of the food....it only recipes. I don't know how the food will be taste like or looks like? If there's a picture, you would say that's looks good but there's no picture. There are millions of recipes, do we suppose to know what's good or not; without providing a picture or sampling it? When a food looks good, people will try to prepare it. If you not a Thai, then you will be very disappointed because you'll not know what your food looks like when you try to prepare it 
 They chosen Robin Williams to be in a Disney movie and this movie turned out to be very corny. Special effects are dull though. If I were a kid I would probably like this movie but now that I'm 15 I think it's stupid. I think I saw it in theater when I was 8 and I don't remember much of it but I think it's not in stores anymore out to buy because people don't really care much about this movie anymore. I don't care about it either. I'm glad this movie is out of stock and it should be. It is very boring! 
 Too specific to charity.  Not generalized enough to perform in a "normal" situation.  Was disappointed with the read.  
 Ritter flip-flopped his WMD position after finding a place on Al Jazeera's payroll.  Al Jazeera is openly sympathetic to Islamofascists, who aim to kill us.  Ritter's arrest was not his first pedophilia-related entanglement, and it's a bit too "black helicopter" to think that local law enforcement sleazebag round-ups are really plots to silence political enemies 
 The book was poorly written. It started with her death, but shed no new light to what the average movie fan already knew. It seemed that the writer went on the internet, found some old articles and put them together and called it a book. I read it in one hour and just finished it simply because I started it 
 There is probably an interesting story in this book, but I could not get past the turgid writing to find it. As a professional writer, Edstrom  should have persuaded Eller to let her rewrite the book to make it more  interesting. Unfortunately, Eller views himself as some kind of interesting  character, which he is not. Since he insisted upon writing the book in the  third person, Eller's name appears repeatedly on every page, which quickly  becomes tiresome. If Eller's ego would not permit him to write as an  omniscient narrator, he should have used the first person viewpoint. As it  is, an otherwise excellent story is amateurishly told 
 I went through three lessons before canning this CD.  The lessons were terrible!  Sometimes they stated the French word before the English word and sometimes afterward, which meant you could be learning the wrong word!  The pronounciations were nowhere near the way the French speak; they were like what a HS French teacher who'd learned from a book and never been to France would speak 
 Anthony C. Sutton is a libertarian conspiracy theorist whose book "Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution" argues that the Bolsheviks were financed by foreign powers, such as Germany, and then by the capitalists that supposedly were their opponents. Sutton believes that the Wall Street bankers and US monopolists wanted Russia to become a huge "captive market", and that the Communist regime made this possible.   The question of contacts between Bolsheviks and capitalist groups is surely an interesting one. Indeed, I dont think any serious historian denies that such contacts existed. But why did they exist? To what extent? And was it really a "conspiracy" in the sense conspiracy theorists believe? After all, there are always strange bedfellows in politics. What about the CIA and one Usama bin-Laden?   My main objection to this book is that it contains several pretty elementary factual errors, and a number of absurd interpretations. This makes the book highly problematic, perhaps even worthless, as source material. The authors research has been sloppy, so why should we trust him on anything? I therefore recommend customers to buy other books on Russian history. If you want to buy this one, do it simply because of interest in conspiracy theory, not out of interest in the actual issues covered.   Here are some of the errors and misinterpretations I managed to find:   Page 19. Sutton claims that there was a 700,000 strong Green Army during the Russian Civil War, which fought both Reds and Whites. He wonders why no history book ever mentions it. Simple: it did not exist. Peasant guerillas sometimes called "Greens" did exist, but they were never centralized into an army. Perhaps Sutton is referring to the great peasant rebellion in Tambov? But that rebellion is well known. He is explictly not referring to the equally well-known Makhnovists. Suttons Green Army seems to be a hallucination.   Page 25. Sutton writes that Trotsky crossed the Finnish-Russian border at Tornea on June 13, 1917. This is a double mistake. Tornea is situated at the Swedish-Finnish border, not the Finnish-Russian border. Moreover, since Finland was still controlled by Russia at the time, the border was strictly speaking the Swedish-Russian border! Finland didnt become independent until December 6, 1917.   Page 33. Sutton claims, on the authority of Canadian intelligence, that Trotsky was a German agent, and even an ethnic German. The "proof" is Trotskys real name, Bronstein. But this is not a German name at all, but a Jewish name. The Jewish language Yiddish is derived from German, but it was spoken by Jews in Russia as well. This is common knowledge, yet Sutton doesnt seem to know it. (That a lone Canadian intelligence operative didnt is perhaps more excusable.) Sutton also claims that the name "Trotsky" is Polish, citing this as another suspiscious fact. But some Bolsheviks were Polish, Felix Dzerzhinsky being the most notorious. Nor is this surprising, since Poland was controlled by Russia during the period in question!   Page 47. Sutton quotes a Moscow newspaper, presumably published by the Kadets, complaining about the "social revolutionaries" getting money from the West. Since I havent seen the original article,this may be risky to judge. But please note that there was a Russian political party called SRs or Social Revolutionaries. The article might therefore be about them, rather than about the Bolsheviks, who, as far as I know, were always referred to simply as "bolsheviki".   Page 52-53. While the Mexican Revolution is surely a complicated story, Suttons analysis of it is mystifying, to say the least. He seem to think that Pancho Villa and Carranza belonged to the same faction, when in reality they often fought each other. Carranzas faction was the most moderate one during the Revolution, which explains why the US supported him once he was firmly in power. After all, Carranza wanted to suppress the radicals around Villa and Zapata. That the Mexican Constitution was written by "Trotskyites" is an absurd statement, since there were no "Trotskyites" in Mexico in 1917. The claim that the constitution was "Soviet-type" is also problematic. It was a very radical document, to be sure, but Mexico has never been socialist! But perhaps Sutton has such a broad definition of socialism that even Mexico becomes socialist?   These, then, are some of the errors I found in this book.  
 ...I really didn't like this book.  I read alot of the success/motivational type books (see my reviews of various Brian Tracy books, for example) but I really had a hard time with this book.  The constant character catchphrases (see the title of this review), the "harrumphs", and I really thought the whole blue vase thing was kind of dumb.  Why not give the poor guy a test that might actually enhance the company's bottomline, rather than tempt him to break a window  in order to steal A STUPID BLUE VASE THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE?  Why not send him after an impossible to get customer or something?  At least it was better than "Who Moved My Cheese? 
 Reading this book (until chapter six, where the book picks up somewhat), I thought to myself, "Why does my teacher hate me so? Does he find interest in learning about someone getting a bad headache from lack of coffee (which takes up an entire chapter)?" This book offers a different look at the Civil War. A boring one. Written 100 years after the Civil War ended (1968), this book set the precedent of "don't write about the Civil War if you aren't going to talk about battles, because it's boring." Read something interesting with your ever-disappearing life 
 There is actually a lot of interesting historical information for the right-of-center reader who wants to learn about the right-wing/Republican successes in bolstering its face time in the American media.   But it's a tough read because Brock is obviously extremely skeptical of pretty much everything that comes out of the mouth of anyone who votes Republican.   Brock hurts his credibility early on when he states flat out that his early conservative writings were actually literary regurgitations of the right wing party line. But what's to keep a reader from viewing this book as just a left-wing version of the same?  I think he could have balanced the book by discussing more specific left-of-center successes. Whenever he does mention the left-wing in the media, it's usually in lofty platitudes about their objectivity and non-partisanship (trust me, Brock really believes this).   He seems to think the left-wing is totally helpless in the face of the right-wing media juggernaut. Does anyone in America actually believe that?  This book has the potential to be an informative read (it's over 400 pages), but it too often lapses into name calling, unsubstantiated generalizations, and conspiratorial excess.   Leave the wild rhetoric to Michael Moore and just give us the facts 
 In response to Adam B.'s review of the book I would just like to say that Babette Cole is NOT a HE .  She is a SHE.  And it kind of negates all the points he makes about sexism and gender roles when he automatically assumes the author is a male.  A correction may want to be made to the review to he does not look like such an idiot.. 
 I find this book to be a big waste of money. I thought for $ 17.00 I would get some useful information, I found it to be lacking in anything useful or worthwhile. Do not waste your money on this one. If I could give it a zero rating that is what it would have 
 The author is obviously a big believer in the "tell the reader what you are going to teach them, tell them in more detail and then tell them what you've told them".    If you are a numbers and figures person that wants to see proof and likes the same information reiterated, then you will love this book.  It references many studies and uses a lot of graphs to support their theories.    If, on the other hand, you a big-picture person and you prefer information in a story format then this book is going to be a long, tedious book to read and you will likely start skimming very early in the book.  
 This poker set is the cheapest quality there is.  For the price, I kind of expected a lesser quality product but not this bad!  The chips are plastic with a metal insert.  The chip edge is sharp and there are a lot of imperfections on the chip like dirt was mixed in it.  Furthermore, the thickness of the chips are UNEVEN.  Therefore, when you stack the chips (depending on the color), 5 white chips may be shorter than 5 black chips.  The poker case handle broke the first time I lifted it.  The chip dividers are loose and the felt material is not glued in properly.  This is really a bad product which should be banned from Amazon.    Save yourself some grief.  Spend a little more money and buy a reputable poker set!  What a waste of time and money 
 There wasn't enough input from primary sources in this book - interviews with, and direct quotes from, family and friends - to make it antyhing resembling a definitive biography.  The details that were provided came off sounding more like heresay than fact, and there was more pop psychology in this than seemed appropriate.  The author came across as extremely knowledgeable about Grant's movies, but then got some key details wrong (as noted in detail by other reviewers) but the rest of it seemed like it was written from the outside looking in, which undermined the credibility of the book.  The photo on the front was the best part 
 After falling in love with their first two albums and praising them among all my friends and family and taking the time to learn their songs by ear on my guitar, I couldn't have been more excited to listen to buy their third album. However, once I did, I couldn't have been more disappointed. The great bands find a way to naturally evolve their sound and conquer new ground without losing their identity or their "soul," so to speak. But where Kings of Leon went to and why is a mystery. Their grit, simplicity, and soul is gone. No more driving beats or bluesy riffs or plain old rock 'n roll passion. The music seems more processed and belaboured and washed out. There's nothing to tap my feet to, and certainly no great riffs that'll make me learn these tracks on my guitar. If this is the way Kings of Leon is headed, I certainly won't be following them. What a shame 
 a very nice size - easy to keep in one's pocket however the illustrations of EKG strips were tiny, poorly printed, and of little use to anyone except a very experienced reader.  On the whole, it was a disapointment as the text itself did not provide basic information on most dysrythmias, forcing the reader to go back to a more detailed textbook. I would not order it 
 I was promised 1-2 day shipping and didn't get it.  I was promised reciept by Dec. 6th and haven't gotten it 
 Our 6-year-old daughter just got this bear for her birthday - unfortunatley, it doesn't work the way they claim.  I hid it at one end of the house, my daughter began searching in the opposite end of the house and the transmitter said "You're getting warmer... (which obviously she wasn't...)".  Half the time she just found the bear accidentally without it giving any hints at all - it just kept saying comments like "You're fun to play with" and other such statements, but nothing to help direct her to the bears location.  She just ended up wandering around the house and the comments coming from the transmitter were mostly haphazard and had nothing to do with where the bear was located.  So the "fun" lasted for barely 10 minutes.  I would love to return it, but we already threw away the box... If your child wants this toy, I would highly suggest you try to guide her toward something else 
 I'm a big fan of The Sopranos so obviously the F word doesn't bother me but this entire series seems like an excuse to show cowboys say the F word and MF. The stories and characters are superficial, boring and unintelligent.    People who like this show are the same people who think that what makes The Sopranos a great show is because people get "whacked" a lot.  
 This book is devoid of humor or insight. Save your money and apply it towards "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers.  I wish I had 
 BEFORE it was a musical it was a cantata with orchestra and children's choir. Slicked, glossed, and cheesy, the broadway versions all fall short of the original, concise masterpiece recorded on the ONE AND ONLY ORIGINAL version alas, out of print and available only on vinyl. As overblown broadway versions go, this 1992 version may be the best. But, for those of us who grew up listening to the original, the broadway versions do nothing but disappoint. The Joseph Consortium version of the original cantata recording included Tim Rice singing the role of Pharoah and was released by Scepter Records. Where the rights may be now for re-release, who knows 
 My oh my...Neil Halstead, what have you been smoking? The change from Slowdive to Mojave 3 was drastic, but tolerable. I enjoyed Ask Me Tomorrow, though I'd much rather have heard another outing in the vein of Slowdive. Out of Tune, was hit or miss. The first few songs hit, the last several were definite misses that seemingly spiraled out of control and landed Mojave 3 into this heap of garbage called 'Excuses For Travelers'. Which is a horrid gathering of 12 poor 'Excuses For' songs. Listen to Neil sing out of key. Listen to him recycle riffs. This is simply a sorry attempt from a once great musician. Do not forsake the wonderfully lush atmospheres of Slowdive for this rediculas Bob Dylan incarnate 
 I don't know, but this book was not very useful to me 
 I guess I am the minority with my review.  I thought this book was a yawn.  Shock value aside (incest and rape, along with a shocking surprise at the end), it read like a high-schooler's angsty prose.  I found myself skipping through much of the overly-descriptive thought, just to get to the point.  I rolled my eyes several times through plot twists as they were just plain absurd.    The book is a quick read (I finished it in about an hour).  I wish I had just taken it out at the library instead of spending $10 on something I can read in one sitting.  All in all, the material is meant for 'mature' readers, but the style is clearly not.  A lot of reviewers say that the 'love' between the main character and her brother is just 'beautiful', but I failed to see the beauty in animalistic um.... stuff between siblings.  In my opinion, this book is purely shock value with no substance, so if that is your thing, then go for it 
 I bought this book after flipping through it in a busy bookstore yesterday, and after getting it home and taking a longer look I was disappointed.  First off, when buying a book on DIY cheap decor, I would expect more than just a re-cap of episodes of the show and a biography of the team.  There are very few instructions on how to create the looks in the photos - a painted chandelier here, a college dorm memo board there, that's about it.   It is also interesting to note that this book gives no prices per project as the show does, so you have no idea what the projects will cost.  I agree with another reviewer that, on paper and without the dismal "before" photos, the rooms are pretty lackluster. A couple of them looked like some of the theatre sets I worked on in college. Sure it's cheap decor but a little more care could be taken with the paint, upholstery and other details - this extra care doesn't cost money, only a matter of time, minutes in some cases, and the finished products would look 100% better.  The tall upholstered headboard for the guest room looked sloppiest of all, I was suprised they actually included it in the book as it looks so slap-dash.  If you're going to bother with a project aimed at making your living space more aesthetically pleasing, at least take the time to make it look good or what's the point?   I have a lot of experience with DIY projects - my Dad is a woodworker, my husband's family runs an upholstery shop, and I am a technical theatre major.  You CAN decorate cheaply yourself and make it look like a million bucks. You don't have to be a talented artist either, it's amazing what you can put together if you have good instructions and a willingness to experiment and screw up from time to time (you can practice a new skill with a very small project and cheap materials so you don't waste a lot of money.) This book will not help you achieve the most style for your money. I would suggest finding a secret shopping deals guide for your area, so you can find the best materials possible for your budget and then find books that contain more practical information on different aspects of decorating (paint techniques, no-sew upholstery, furniture finishes, etc.)     
 When I read the reviews I thought the book would talk about foreplay. I can't tell the story, but I bought it for my husband. After a week he told me he had read some,-but I wasn't getting any good response, so I asked him for the book-. I read it in less than an hour, and I was so disappointed my heart sank... the book mostly encourages on being a closed union to take care of everyday chores equally. We have that already, we're like perfect roomates, get along great, everyday chores get happily distributed by themselves between the both or us. But he keeps thinking that if he's a good husband, meaning all that it's in this book, then he only needs to be "in the mood" may be once a month, and just go silently and finish within a minute. I'm sorry this book didn't help my pathetic life.  Ray Romano Inawomansbody 
 This is a maddening book.  Roughly half consists of facts (I assume - no citations) concerning writers and other creative artists, some of them wonderful.  Another quarter states, usually without comment, the causes of death for such artists.  And the final quarter consists of spare comments (often just a sentence fragment)on themes of life and death, meant to invoke pity and awe but instead remindful of "Deep Thoughts" written somewhat in the manner of the Cantos, phony and inflated.  Imagine something like: "Sophocles. Dante. Heine.  Djuna Barnes.  Writer." (referring to himself) 
 Most of the online reviews promise a lot but the book doesn't deliver and that is a great disappointment since an understandable guide is need. The author does not explain and illustrate the relationships between rgb (additive) and cmyk (reflective) in enough detail for one to comprehend how to read color coordinates in the info window and then correct the images using PhotoShop's image adjustments whether they be curves, levels, or whatever (which require thinking in both color spaces). The author is an expert on the four process color inks on the press and how they relate to cmyk color densities on printed paper but how to achieve the corresponding correct color densities in your digital files using PhotoShop is not clearly communicated. I've learned more reading the compressed "Create Print" articles in MacWorld by authors like David Blatner (a fine writer) then I learned from this book. My recommendations are: if you want to understand the basics of digital prepress then the Agfa Guide to Digital Color Prepress (though dated) is far better; if you want to understand channels then PhotoShop Channel Chop (also dated) is better; if you wants to understand curves then the PhotoShop Artistry books (version 5 or 6) are better. If you want a professional's insights into how he goes about correcting cymk color situation along with lots of self accolades, well this is it. Also be warned that none of the photographs measure up to the quality of good commercial stock photo images. Hopefully, by the next version of PhotoShop a good technical editor can turn this book into the gem the PhotoShop audience needs on this topic 
 I looked for reviews of these, and found I am not the only one having problems.  I have used about 10 so far, and they are generally recording fine in iTunes.  The problem is that my car stereo will not read them. The stereo works just fine with other brands of CD-R, but these just spin and spin until I get an error message.  Next time, I will go back to the HP CDs and wait until they go on sale 
 I was really disappointed with this book. I did not like the illustrations or story line. My son never had an interest in this one either. With so many great other choices for pop up books, I would recommend thye Chuck Murphy pop up series, those really held my son's interest 
 If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 More Left Wing Liberal News media hate fest rhetoric based on rearrangement of the facts to suit the conclusion. Yes Bush led the country to war and yes Iraq is troublesome and problematic on many levels. But we are in fact at war with a determined enemy out to destroy our culture and make us all worship and worse yet act a certain way. And even worse yet writers like Mr. Rich are helping that come true. I definitley did agree with the authors conclusions and accusations. 
 I wish Mr. Gore had imbibed more of a biblical foundation during his growing up years in the Bible belt.  He uses the thesis, that the only thing which creates familial bonds is luvvvvv, to then say that families come in all shapes and forms....2 daddies, or 2 mommies...ughhhhh!  It is no accident that in the book of Genesis, the creation of the familial bond is linked to the sexual act between a man and a woman. "A man shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh." In the New Testament, Paul interprets this sexually, arguing that for this reason one should not sleep with a prostitute inasmuch as you would be becoming "one flesh" with her.  So, the Gores need to repent, return to the biblical foundation, and realize that luvvvvvvvvv is not the sole nexus where familial bonds are released. It is equally in the coming together sexually of male and female.  But then, if he were to say that, he would make certain "families" feel bad. Then he would lose part of his political support. Then he would be called "bigoted" "racist" "homophobe" and "dumb."  
 I picked up Once Were Warriors because, like most other people, I had seen the movie and was expecting a riveting tale. This is, however, one of those rare cases where the movie surpasses the book in almost all facets.  The story is set against the backdrop of a government housing project in New Zealand and describes the trials and tribulations of a Maori family living on the dole (unemployment). The main characters are the parents, Ruth and Jake Heke, and some of their children, Nig, Booggie and Grace. The movie (unlike the book) is fraught with emotion and sorrow, and you are swept into the netherworld of Maori society almost against your will. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the movie, I wouldn't have been expecting as much from the book and would have been less disappointed and more forgiving towards the author. Unfortunately the bland and ineptly described milieu, the one-dimensional characters and lack of dialogue punctuation in the book gives a feeling of emptiness and you are left wanting more. The story itself is not badly constructed and I could be charitable and say that Alan Duff employed the aforesaid writing devices to emphasize the soullessness of the society he describes. Regrettably he disproves this theorem by descending into a mire of soppiness at the end of the book.  He allows the characters to become pathetically clichéd and tries to turn a fictional account into a self-serving sermon on the moralities of his society. Both the book and the believability of the characters are devalued and made to suffer for this cheap trick of his. On the positive side, the book initially makes a powerful statement about the effects of developed societies intruding into more primitive ones. The feelings of displacement and defeatism of a conquered nation are also explored as well as the impact they have on the psyche of the subjugated culture.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this book to anyone not extremely devoted to the Maori culture and the societal difficulties of New Zealand. There are many better books available in terms of the emotional, societal and familial structure issues this book attempts to explore. If, however, you like your moralizing fed with a big spoon and rammed down you throat, this is the book for you 
 I ordered two of the authors book's based on raving reviews from a friend, not actually this title but another. I ordered this one as well and must say what a total waste of money. The first section of the book is about the authors travels and how she claims she was visited by the Virgin Mary...umm yeah right, there isn't much practicle help in this book at all, only her boring tales of travel around the globe. The second part of the book is a list of goddesses and their qualities. don't bother with this book, it a time waster and $$$ waster I can't believe Hay house published this work of junk. After reading this authors other works I do feel she is very very over rated and has taken the angel working brigade thing a little too far and people have jumped on this band wagon if that wasn't the case this author would be unknown because her writing is terrible. The misleading promises on the back of the book should be taken off as well "Manifest anything you want instantly"...I didn't find anything in the book even about *helping* your life, it was all about her travels...Like I said a total joke..I won't be so easily led when buying books by spiritual workers again. 
 I was truly hoping this would be the one to work properly, but unfortunately, it did not perform well.  Very disappointed!  I t would not run properly and I needed a humidifier that would run continuously throughout the night.  It would run for a few hours and shut off and nothing I did could get it running again until the next night.   This is my third one in two years, and I am tired of buying these things and they do not work properly, they either conk out, or leak water. I finally invested in a Sears Kenmore humidifier and it is working fine; although I paid a little bit more for it.  They had great reviews from customers who were giving testimonies of having their Kenmore humidifier going on three years. I have spent a lot more on the three before this, so I see this as a way of saving money and getting reliable service 
 I know that I am a contrarian here but... I didn't like the book at all - I was initially so excited to see the book, but when I finally did see it, I was very disappointed.  I recommend that you actually see the book before buying it.  You may be disappointed too 
 I wonder whether Terry Goodkind has fallen into the Anne Rice and JK Rowling trap of selling so many books that editors don't dare to interfere with them anymore. Any sane editor would have told Terry Goodkind to cut about 200 pages of this novel. Cutting the endless speeches and repetition of the same points over and over again might have helped make this book somewhat up to the standards Mr. Goodkind has set by the previous books of the series (except Pillars of Creation, which, frankly, I skipped). The narrative is long-winded, the endless exposition is tiring and the repetition of Richard's - questionable - moral lesson at every given chance sinks the book in a quagmire of all talk and no action. The plot is ridiculous, and the final resolution cheap and lazy.  I must confess I'm growing tired of the way Goodkind writes Richard and Kahlan. He underuses the latter and makes the former into a terribly boring stiff. Where's the spark?  Somehow the air's gone out of Sword of Truth somewhere in the second half of Faith of the Fallen, and I only hope Goodkind will get it back to finish off the series as strongly as it's started. 
 While I agree with the author that hormone balance is essential to good health and well being, I have to take exception to the "estrogen dominance" theory. The author is clearly a disciple of Dr. John Lee and his bogus theory of estrogen dominance. I was a victim of this rubbish until my problem was diagnosed as estrogen deficiency. As any woman going through menopause will tell you, there is no such animal as "estrogen dominance" and the perpetuation of this nonsense is the cause of much misery. A much better book on female hormone replacement is "Natural Hormone Balance" by Uzzi Reiss

 Reading this book, I had to think, WHAT the heck is wrong with Christine? She is a horrible, unstable, alcoholic mother. The farther I got into the book, the more irritated I became. For instance, when Rayona and Christine are packing their belongings to move, Christine has many more garbage bags (yes, garbage bags) full of her own possessions. If I were Rayona, I would've ran away. To further prove my point, when Christine and Rayona reach their destination (Christine's mom's house), Christine runs away and leaves Rayona with a grandmother she's never really known. How selfish can one be?! Rayona tries running after her with her garbage bag, but the bag rips open and for most of the story she has no idea where her mother is. Great parenting skills, indeed.   I don't understand how Rayona can put up with this lady's bull. I'd resent her so much for putting me through that, and by the way, Rayona's probably worried sick about her because her health continuously is deteriorating throughout the book.   The only semi-interesting aspect of this book is that it's told from Rayona's perspective, Christine's, and Ida (Christine's mother). However, I found most of the stories they told to be dull and pointless. The end has no closure whatsoever. Skip this one! 
 I really wanted to be able to give this book 5 stars. I agree with many of Shalit's common-sense and fresh-insight conclusions - that modern pop culture has both furthered the cause of misogyny and totally villified anything that has ever been traditionally feminine; that there is nothing inherently happy or liberated about the sexual provocateur; that modest behavior and dress are a good way to set boundaries for how you want others to treat you and effectively differentiates you as someone who adheres to more old-fashioned behavioral expectations (any woman can tell you how differently you get treated by men, women and children going out in a modest A-line dress vs. going out in a micro mini and tube top). In short, I AGREE with Wendy Shalit's theses.  However, I'll just cut to the chase: the presentation and the scholarship in this book are absolutely terrible. I cannot believe that this was turned in as a college paper. Where to begin with what's wrong with its execution? I suppose a good place to start would be the fact that Shalit makes wild sweeping historical generalizations without ever providing any sort of support for these claims aside from anecdotal stories and soundbites from women's magazines. One that pops out at me is her repeated claim that female modesty made men treat ALL women as ladies. A friend of mine and I read this and agreed Shalit was smoking the good crack for that one. Tell that to the systematically raped slave women, or the prostitutes of the Victorian era - they had the highest patron count of any era's prostitutes in American history - or immigrant farm worker women of this very decade, or my own very modest and shy hispanic grandmother who suffered sexual harassment on a near daily basis in her factory job in the late 60s. I suppose if you are a privileged, formally educated and sheltered white girl the way Shalit is, it might seem like "all women" got treated as "ladies" before the 1950s, but anyone who has made even a brief survey of women's history can easily write that notion off as utterly laughable at best, and heinously insensitive at worst.   The only way this claim, which she repeats throughout her book, makes any sense is to assume that she, like so many other women's writers before her, was simply not including poor and minority females under the umbrella of the term "women." Really, though, I just think it's her social and class naivete coming into play, and other reviewers are 100% right when saying that it hopelessly colors her worldview.  Another flaw is that she totally eschews any sort of ressearch or surveys about women's psychology, choosing instead to support her claims about women's current well being from articles and anecdotes found in Mademoiselle, Marie Claire, Cosmopolitan and other women's rags, as though we all take our psychological cue from those, and as though they have ever claimed to be an accurate barometer of female zeitgeist. Not so much.  The text itself is meandering. Shalit cannot seem to decide whether she is a woman ready to take charge of her own autonomy, or if she is still a child who needs parenting - she discusses "young girls" and "children" with "we" statements several times in the book. She was 23 when she wrote this; at best it makes her look infantile.    She also cannot decide who her reader is. In her last chapter, for example, she refers to "you" as though she were speaking to her peers, then "you do not have a monopoly on sexual revolutions" to her parents' peers, then "YOU, professor!" as though the whole tome was directed to a college professor... all within 3 pages of each other.   This kind of meandering context renders the subject matter utterly irrelevant and disconnected from any concrete evidence; her prose bears little in the way of logical conclusions and many different theories are introduced seemingly without relation to each other in the same chapters, so that her conclusions seem far less than definitive.  Additionally, I found her "nyah-nyah"-style gossippy speculation on the personal lives of various women ranging from Katie Roiphe to Tori Spelling to be distasteful and, dare I say it, immmodest.  I am saddened to have to write this, because sexual and behavioral modesty are fascinating subjects within the context of modern sexual politics, and I agree with Shalit that they are not concepts that are nearly as easily dismissable as feminists would like to assert, nor nearly as one-dimensional and straightforward as the conservatives might sometimes claim.  The ideas she sets forth here ARE different; her insights ARE interesting and her suggestions for possible alternative viewpoints about the problems women are facing are fascinating. They even work without her silly claims of historical precedence. It's just a shame that this subject hasn't been tackled by a better writer... and a better thinker.  
 Please do not spend your time and money with this wristtop. I received with battery problems, it does not charge completely and suunto does not have the proper tech service available to fix it. You have better and cheaper options such as forerunner 201 or 301 or the timex trail runner. The suunto signal detection is quite weaker and when hiking grand canyon the unit remained most of time without capturing signal at all 
 The ideal exegete in the also ideal Sola Scriptura traditio is one that leads the Holy Text in the original greek take him wherever it leads him, just like Jesus inviting us to deny ourselves and follow him. According to the calvinist ideal (see the Westminster Confession) the Bible in the original languages is the ultimate judge. Thiselton is a good exegete but when it comes to certain verses that uncover the anti biblical side of  his calvinist tradition, Thiselton with all the naturality simply gives us his calvinist translation, and even tough he says that "linguistics and semantics has to have the control". A crystal clear example is 1 Cor 6:9-10. "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God".   In this verses Paul says clearly that if we, christians, commit adultery, drunkness etc we won`t inherit the Kingdom of God. Paul uses the crucial phrase "inherit the Kingdom" using twice the verb "inherit" in the future, once before the list of vices and once more at the end of it. With this verse it is obvious that a christian, a real one can lose salvation and justification and Paul reinforces this writing "Don`t deceive yourselves" (See also Eph 5:5). What Thiselton does is: 1) Telling us that Paul has his own "grammar" Thiselton translates the first "inherit" using the present time, instead of the future as the greek demands in order to save the calvinist "perseverance of the saints" doctrine. The calvinist doctrine that Thiselton follows teaches that when the Bible talks about judgment is talking about the genuiness of the person judged, is he or she real christian or not.  Thiselton tells us that the inherit concept in the Bible has present and future implications, and he wants to shift our attention from the future judgment, to the present (are you a real christian). But the one who has to tells us when God is talking about the future implication of the "inherit" concept is the Sacred Author. A good exegete follows the greek text, Thiselton changes the future for the present, pointing to a differente direction than Paul the Apostles.   The real grammar Thiselton follows is not "Paul`s grammar", and he admits that he is not following greek grammar in 1 Cor 6:9. He is following Calvin`s grammar. Yes, he talks about "new hermeneutics" but he writes as an old fashion good calvinist and sometimes zwinglian exegete.  His treatment of the Eucharistic texts of First Corinthians reveals once more that he is following Calvin or Zwingli, but it is a real joy when he comments 1 Corinthians 11:29-30  "For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not judge the body rightly. For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep". All Thiselton`s calvinist or zwinglian interpretation shatters when he comments this verse, verse 30. Correct me, but Thiselton just quotes 2 fathers of the church when he treats the eucharistic sections of First Corinthians, Augustine, and Ignatius. This says so much about this commentary .   This commentary is a good one (I love his treatment about the so called Spirit Baptism), but remember Thiselton is calvinist and he is not Matthew Henry, also a calvinist, but one that had the honesty to follow the truth even when the Bible took him away from Calvin`s errors.   
 As most anyone will tell you, these speakers do have excellent sound and if you're just going to set them up on your desktop, then I'd give them 5 stars.  However, the design for wall mounting these is horrible and you can't ceiling-mount them.  Logitech does not make separate mounts for these and no "universal speaker mounts" will work with them.  If you want to see how they mount, go to Logitech's website, go to product support and enter wall mounting.  Some might argue that they're computer speakers, not home entertainment center speakers, but for $300, I expect a little bit better design 
 Yeah, there is a lot wrong in America; the powerful do take advantage of the weak. I would have liked some perspective though rather than just a whining account.    Bob Herbert can do better than this. It sounds like a disgruntled Co-op board. Since the issues are much more serious an attempt at integrating the problem or recounting it with what should happen in America would be in order. The question begs, "Is America all in our minds? 
 Satanic Witch? That's like saying pagan catholic, it doesn't make any sense. This is about a man who's making some money off of some poor suckers who believe in his promises. Pick up a real wiccan book and learn about the TRUE and only craft. One which certainly does not include "satan". I hope to see this book laughed out of stock 
 Beware! This collar does not break away, and is not safe. This morning my kitty became entangled in part of my son's toy tent. The collar did not loosen or breakaway, and the cat was unable to breathe until my husband cut the collar and freed her. Very scary. Had we not been home she would not have made it. I recommend you find a true breakaway collar to purchase - not this one

 If this book didn't have Orson Scott Card's name on the cover, I would never have thought it was written by the same author as "Speaker for the Dead". The dialogue was stilted and simplistic, the characters, who seemed to spend a great deal of time "feeling each others pain", were uninteresting and one-dimensional, and the plot was... well... boring. Wow! A real stinker. I wish I had spent those hours reading ActionScript 2.0 
 Being a huge fan of Golden Age mystery fiction and also an admirer of Gypsy Rose Lee, I was very eager to read this book.  I also have the film "Lady of Burlesque" with Barbara Stanwyck, which follows the book fairly closely and which I thorougly enjoy.  However, although Gypsy Rose Lee "stars" in the story which involves murders among the striptease acts in an Opera House, the writing is rather uninvolving and I who read voraciously had trouble staying interested.  I also confess to being rather annoyed at the petty squabbling between the women which fails to capture the friendships that also develop between women.  In fact, the characterizations remain on an extremely superficial level and the few colorful instances (almost "pre-code" sort of moments) do not rescue the story or make it any more compelling.  I found myself bored and wanting to read something else.  It's a pity, because I truly did want to like it and the premise was promising.  My conclusion:  Gypsy Rose Lee was a very beautiful woman and I imagine a powerful and provocative performer with some class to boot, but she is not a great writer by any stretch of the imagination.  Being a great performer or leading a colorful life does not necessarily mean that you can write; writing is a whole other art form and too many people think it requires no particular skill since one is not required to do eye-high kicks or hit high notes.  They're absolutely wrong, as misfires such as this demonstrate (although I've read far worse).    A disappointment, but may fill the bill for someone looking for a light read.  To use an apt cliche:  mediocre fare.  
 Don't waste your money!  There are good books on this worthy subject but this one is very bad.  It's poorly written, pompous in tone, yet full of lame assumptions any college student could see beyond.  The few good ideas are not the author's own, though he rarely gives credit where credit is due.  It's as if it was written in one sitting, by a not very intelligent person who had done little reading on the subject and didn't have much respect for ideas.  I don't usually bother writing bad reviews but politically I'm on the same side as Sale on many of these issues and he makes an embarrassing, sophomoric mess of them 
 if blum's book has any shred of validity (that the USA and capitalism is evil)?  why is he still alive in the "evil" USA, and how did this drivel of a book get publish in the "evil" USA?  like the religous right and islamic fundmentalists you can't argue or reason with these leftist kooks or there supporters.  they are going to believe what they want to believe.    fallacies and data taken out of context become doctrine, and science and facts are irrelevant.  blum is an emotionally driven zealot of the marxist religon.    still like many faith-based works of fiction, these brainwashed leftist writings are easy and enjoyable to read.  
 This book is a bore. Middle class English in the 60s. Everything that needs to be said has been said. Why bring this subject back up in the 1990s. Another English writer who writes beautifully but unfortunately, has nothing to say 
 This was just a regirgitation of all the other drivel written about her. Author should be ashamed to take his royalty check! We all know the little stories-heck, we could have dug them up online! Not much depth here. He makes veiled comments about Kelly and her life, but only goes so far. VERY DISAPPOINTIN 
 Do NOT order this book as an E-Book! You can only print out 19 pages every 7 days. As a diet book, if you can't have it handy and accessible it doesn't do you much good. I have had to order the paperback (which I'm excited about), but have not had good luck trying to get a refund and return the e-book 
 A great idea poorly executed.  The construction is cheap.  The screen is marginal at best.  But worst of all, it refuses to recognize any of the 3 digital cameras I have on hand or a USB card reader.  A piece of junk that I am now returnin 
  "A massive bombing campaign in Cambodia. Anything that flies on anything that moves." This is the message 'diplomatic' message Nixon-Kissinger team gave to the millitary. In Kissinger's view diplomacy is whatever you can get away with; sadly that's easy if the audience knows very little.  
 This was the movie that gave us The Brat Pack, a staple of a certain 80s cultural set.  The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying.  Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect.  Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall.  Out of all the dramedies of the John Hughes movies, this was the one I liked the least.  Maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered.  Maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college.  It was trying to be the next generation "Graduate" movie, and I didn't relate when my time came.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that I have been let down by many people and didn't have that network of friends in similar situations, and the isolation I felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia.  I guess I was just a little more bitter.  Plus, as my life was surrounded by work and little else, I didn't have all the dramas going on they did.  That was kind of sad, the one scene where Rob Lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team.  It proves you really can't go home again and there are some clinging to the past.  Not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it Rob Lowe finds those enormous granny panties.    This caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset.  It's not a bad story, but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold.    
 If you were tempted into buying the book by its title, expecting to find detailed information about Nazi policies against the Polish gentile population and its suffering and dying, you will be badly disappointed. Only the first chapter, entitled "The German Occupation of Poland", which makes up a full 39 of the 219 pages of the book's main part, deals with the subject matter of the books title, The Forgotten Holocaust. Although it addresses every realm of Nazi brutality, from the executions of members of the "intelligentsia" over mass expulsions and deportations to the concentration camps, the reader still doesn't know at the end of it how all the horrors described add up to the horrendous death toll of the Polish Gentile population (out of 5,384,000 victims of prisons, death camps, raids, executions, annihilation of ghettoes, epidemics, starvation, excessive work and ill treatment, 2.9 to 3.2 million were Jews and the rest were Gentiles). Such a detailed breakdown is essential information that a book entitled "The Forgotten Holocaust" should absolutely contain. Instead of providing it, Lucas leaves the reader with the single reference in the notes to this chapter (no. 174) that "Most informed estimates place the loss of Polish Christians at 2.8 to 3.1 million and Polish Jews at 2.9 to 3.1 million". He then dedicates five chapters to "The Polish Government and the Origins of the Underground", "The Military Underground in Operation", "Civilian Resistance and Collaboration", "Poles and Jews" and "The Polish Government, the Home Army and the Jews". Chapters five and six have a certain relevance because they do away with the myth that the Poles were mostly collaborators of the Nazis in the killing of the Jews or grinning bystanders. As for the other three: Is this a book about Polish suffering under Nazi occupation, or a book about the organisation, politics and activities of the Polish underground? Chapter seven contains an account of the Warsaw Uprising, the repression of which was the greatest single Nazi atrocity of the war - certainly gripping, but I read a better account of that tragedy in Earl F. Ziemke's "The Soviet Juggernaut" edited by Time-Life Books in 1980.  The book is written in a thoroughly pro-Polish stance, which is certainly justified but becomes irritating at times, to say the least. The statement that angered me most in that respect is found on page 93 in Chapter Three about the operations of the Polish military underground: "Though the Polish resistance killed about 150,000 Germans, this did not come remotely close to the 5,384,000 Polish citizens killed by the Germans during the occupation." I frankly don't know what to make of this sentence. First of all, it is not clear whether the figure for Germans killed by the Polish resistance refers only to military or also to civilian casualties. In the former case, it would be wildly exaggerated, cross off a naught and you got the accurate figure including casualties sustained by German forces during the Warsaw Uprising. In the latter case, we are talking about a lot of innocent people who deserve more than only such a perfunctory notice, even if the number of Polish victims was 36 times higher. But as Lukas doesn't even bother to provide a detailed breakdown of the 5,384,000 Polish Jews and Christians who perished under Nazi occupation, why should he dedicate more than one sentence to German civilians killed by the Polish underground? The apologetic tone of the sentence is another irritating factor. When we speak of crimes against innocent people, comparing numbers and setting off one crime against the other is an utterly inappropriate attitude, one that I would expect to find with a pro-Nazi revisionist, but not with someone who is supposed to be a serious scholar.  I must say that I once recommended this book on a Third Reich discussion forum after reading through its first chapter. I would not recommend it again, however, after going through the whole of it. As an old German saying goes, you should not praise the day before the evening.. 
 Jill Nelson is just another angry, bitter, whiny black woman with an axe to grind.  This book is filled with the same old whining and cliches which have grown really old and tired.  Almost everything she touches on is so predictable whether it's accusing black men who date outside the race as being sellouts (while saying nothing of black women who do the same thing of course), demonizing the Million Man March, whining about the light skin/dark skin thing and basically ranting about how the black woman is a pathetic victim.  If it were a black man writing this foolishness, he'd be written off as an angry old coot in a minute.  Well that's exactly what Jill Nelson is as far as I'm concerned.   
 No offence,but I couldn't agree more with most everyone else who's rated this collection.It just isn't right without Sons Of The Desert,Way Out West,The Music Box and Another Fine Mess.For me the best films in this DVD set would be March Of The Wooden Soldiers,Be Big and The Lucky Dog.The latter being a collector's item going by how it was Stan and Ollie's very first film together,even before they became the famous comedy duo.Utopia would be another collector's item,being their very last film from 1950.I hadn't realised they were around that long.However,their appearance in this film is an eyesore,with Stan so thin and sick looking and Ollie three hundred pounds overweight.One thing you may notice,is the film's remarkable simularity to Gilligan's Island 
 GREEN NAZI ZOMBIES COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF A SWIMMING POOL TO FEED ON THE LIVING? AUGHH!!! BAD ACTING, BAD DIRECTION, TERRIBLE GORE, TOO LONG FLASHBACK HORRABLE DUBING AND THE PORN MUSIC IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE TELLS YOU WERE THEY WANTED TO GO WITH THIS PICTURE. DAMN THIS MOVIE SUCKS..... 
 I have these in black, and while I find them to go with just about every outfit I wear to work, I wish they were just a little (read: quite a lot) less uncomfortable. Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable.   All in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort 
 It seems i must  agree a hundred percent , if not more, with our good friend mrashdan_mradzi who has written his long review on this book. The simple fact that at least one of the incidents in the book is false clearly shows that this book is a danger to a new believer or anyone even curious about the Islamic Religion 
 Disappointed.  This book is worthless.  The author should not try to write a book while smoking dope.  The first half of the book is a Mac-is-great commercial.  The last half of the book is a Mac-is-great commercial.  Yes, I know the Mac-is-great, I love the Mac, Macs are cool, Macs are usefull, rah rah rah.  Unfortunately, the book is content free.  No actual developers were involved in the production of this book; no actual developers were informed by reading this book 
 I love looking through baby name books, and, truth be told, I was running out of names for my Sims, so I picked this one up.  Although lengthy, the book gives you lists of names.  Never once did I see a definition or a reason why a certain name is popular.  I like unique names, but there are no prenunciation keys or anything helpful.    Just lists.  Famous names, names famous people used for their kids, unique middle names, and, of course, the most popular names.  There's a lot of overlapping--the list of most popular names in Canada and the US and the UK are devastatingly similar.  Even more disappointing is the part where they start listing popular names in other countries, and I flip the page to find the list of 100 in the US quickly dwindles through France and Ireland to not even five in Middle Eastern countries.  Just when this book starts getting interesting, they ruin it by forgetting the follow-through.  I would like to have seen a history on each name, reasons why they are popular, and a pronunciation key to help sound out difficult, unique names.  I finally ended up flipping through the index, picking out names for my Sims, then sending it back 
 While this book does a good job of pointing out the conflicts/issues/problems that interfaith couples will face when raising children, I found it definitely biased toward choosing one religion in the home, and making that religion Judaism.  If you are looking for ways in which to incorporate two religions in a home--skip this book 
 Utter nonsense. How else does one describe this?   A few erudite critics have already pointed out that with which I concur and on which will elaborate slightly: The "math" that's used is set up to find the answer the author desires. The elaboration: You could also find a similar "code" in anything, including, say, the US Constitution, or--hence my title--"Winnie."  This is a classic example of we humans trying desperately to find a pattern where none exist. Don't waste your time with this foolishness 
 I have been a pen & brush graphics artist all of my life. Now that I have retired, I decided to try computer image manipulation. I bought this book in the hopes of learning to recolor, flip, distort, or whatever via my computer (I just got my first one in 2000)and have found it maddening to use. The authors gloss over information vital to a basic understanding of Photoshop and then blithely show highly advanced image techniques that cannot be duplicated without the underlying knowledge. It pretends to being step-by-step, but ignores crucial steps. For example, a complex collage is created using a number of disparate images: how did they select only that portion of the original? How did they make the surrounding parts of the image transparent so the background shows through? This are the most basic maneuvers, but a couple of months with the book left me unenlightened. I have since found another book that delivers on the premise of this one, Photoshop 6 In An Instant by Toot & Woolridge, and am now happily photoshopping away -- this despite the fact that Photoshop 6 for Dummies was more ... and has many pages of color illustration, in contrast to Photoshop 6 In An Instant's reliance on B&W even to show color manipulation 
 This book has a shocking, last minute twist a la Sixth Sense.  The surprise in the movie, Sixth Sense, however, works.  Your view of the story is suddenly turned on its head and you're left wanting to go back to look for the clues that you missed before.  In the case of this book, the twist was completely unbelievable and even felt a bit obscene.  To make it every more frustrating, I thought the book was  actually a good read, and I kept reading thinking the mystery's solution would be revealed and the intriguing  questions would somehow be tied up. Instead, the ending left me rolling my eyes and feeling duped rather than entertained. This Beach Road leads to nowhere 
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.  
 It's rare you see such gushing praise for an essay collection, more impressive is the average length of these Amazon reviews.  It seems the reviewers like to look at their own words as much as this author does.    I didn't like this book for a simple reason.  There are better things to read than varied complaints and woes about changing times.  Sure, sometimes it is good but these lopsided views.... he is as focused on discontent as he is verbose.     If that sounds good to you, buy this book..... most people have stuff to do 
 The book is easy to understand, but there should be a solutions manual, or at least an answer key to the exercises. It has been very difficult for me to "learn the mechanics" and "apply the concepts" at the end of each chapter. The pace of the course allows the teacher to solve only 2 or 3 exercises in class, and the book certainly does not make selfstudy easy. Needless to say, that you can't learn financial accounting just by reading. To makes things even worse, a study guide, which does not refer to the same exercises in the book, is out of print 
 I've heard Al Lee speak before and thought that what he had to say was sensible.  However, although I basically agree with his approach, I just cannot recommend his book.  I found it to be too simplistic and to contain too much filler.  There are many much better real estate investment books out there.  Some specific complaints: * The margins are ridiculously wide; this book is much smaller than it seems. * Some of the appendixes (especially appendix A) contained too much filler. * much of the book is a painfully detailed description of fields in a spreadsheet.  This sort of documentation should be directly in the spreadsheet (where it will be in sync with the latest version of the spreadsheet, etc... rather than in a book.) * When I heard Al speak in person he emphasized new homes and owning property in remote locations if needed (eg, owning property in Dallas even if one does not live there).  The book did not really touch on either of these topics.  That said, I did find a couple parts of this books to be useful or interesting.  These are: * The chapter on Financial Statements was useful; In particular the ways that items for a rental property (like rents due, funds in lender held escrow accounts, property taxes due, etc...) show up on the statements was interesting. * The tip that you can begin advertising a property for rent before you have closed on it. * The tip that you can try to time your lease expiration dates to  be during times when school is out. * The recommendation that you work with a property manager who is willing to / capable of helping you find properties to purchase 
 As a 4th year medical student and, formerly a lawyer, I am confident that Mr. Kessler is on a rabbit trail that will never pan out across the spectrum of diseases he suggests. His ideas sound wonderful, but he is missing a fundamental problem. Diagnostic tests inevitably incur false positives and false negatives, and to greatly simplify, as you improve on one, you amplify the other. So, for example, as whatever algorithm you want to concoct becomes better at predicting disease and reducing false negatives, the false positives will go up. People will be treated unnecessarily and that often is harmful. There's a word for that-iatrogenic. This is nothing new and well-known in medical research. Thus, silicon is hardly going to displace MDs. But, it may foster lots of unnecessary and iatrogenic care that will drive the cost of medicine far beyond where it already is today. In addition, it will provide new fodder for the med mal lawyers. Truly, medicine is an art and a science. 
 I bought myself one of these and used it minimally and was happy.  I then bought one for my daughter.  She used it about 5 times in a little over a year and it quit.  The blade assembly as per other reviews.  It is going to cost about $50. to repair.  Now mine is smelling.  I am using my old 15 year old Oster and it is still working.  Also to my surprise it is doing a better job.  Just not as pretty.  I have KA stand mixer, hand blender, food processors large and small, emersion blender and attachments for all.  Love all of them.  Will buy other KA but not this again 
 I am a Christian who reads these sorts of books frequently. This is easily the worst book of this sort I've ever read.  First, Glynn simply isn't a very good author. His style is awkward and unengaging, and he often repeats himself.  Second, he takes away with his left hand what he tries to give with his right. At times he seems to affirm the New Testament and Christ, but at other times he offers up a kind of universalism (e.g. Hindu near-death-experiences of Krishna prove that God sends to us after death whoever we'll be most comfortable with). At other times, he supports the idea that any belief at all is sufficient, as "proved" by prayer and meditation being medically effective regardless of the content of the patient's "faith".  Glynn's theology seems to be pick-and-choose. He likes what he likes (like the Sermon on the Mount) and rejects what he doesn't like (like some New Testament commands concerning women, and apparently nearly all of the Old Testament). All of this combines the be a poor apologetic indeed. To follow his example appears to mean accepting what you want and rejecting what you don't want, which hardly seems controversial.  Lastly, he simply doesn't do a good job of collecting or presenting evidence. Instead of this, I'd recommend the book, "God?: A Debate Between a Christian and an Atheist" by Craig and Sinnot-Armstrong. It's easily twice the book this one is, and half of it was written by an atheist 
 This is a remake of An Affair to Remember with Cary Grant and Deborah and it does not work. Some movies just should not be remade. The ONLY thing good about this movie is Katharine Hepburn's appearance. Get the original 
 I'm only writing this review about two chapters, those dealing with Henry David Thoreau. This book will gain (is gaining) much hype and is being assigned, on numerous syllabi, in contrast to Thoreau. Hallie grossly simplifies Thoreau's thought, and I'd caution the student looking at both to read Thoreau's "Plea for Captain John Brown" and "Civil Disobedience" before heeding Hallie's criticism. In his other book, Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed, Hallie writes about a village that became a stop on an "Underground Railroad" for Jews escaping the Holocaust. Yet, in this book, he makes no mention of Thoreau's (and Emerson's, and Alcott's) own contribution to America's own Underground Railroad.  Meanwhile, Hallie seems to have trouble with the English language. Again and again, he criticizes Thoreau for his use of terms like "vulgar sadness," concluding that Thoreau himself thinks that all sadness is vulgar. Hallie doesn't seem to understand that vulgar is an adjective and that, in using it, Thoreau is therefore writing about a particular kind of sadness: that kind of sadness which is vulgar. In Hallie's black and white ethical world, such subtleties aren't allowed.  I could say much more about the Thoreau chapters in this book, but I should, instead, just point out a fact from Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed. In that book Hallie reports that a villager from Le Chambon confronts him with something like the words "Don't talk to me of good. I wasn't trying to do good." In essence, this villager is giving him the same message that Thoreau was trying to express: compassion cannot bear to be sentimentalized. The irony of the similarity between this villager's view and Thoreau's is staring Hallie right in the face, but he doesn't see it. One reason for this might be that Hallie appears to have little sensitivity to irony at all. (To get a clue what this lack of sensitivity to irony means, consider that, in a dictionary of literary terms written in the 1940s, the authors wrote that "An awareness of irony is one of the hallmarks of an intelligent mind." 
 That's all I could think of when my family and I sat down to watch this movie together.  We had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in Santa Fe.  The story itself is so powerful and moving. Built in the 1870s, the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit. The sisters' prayed a novena to St. Joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived, built the "miraculous" staircase, and then disappeared without being paid. The staircase is a double helix with no visible support. It's 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals, and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near Santa Fee!  This movie however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real resentment towards Indians and also likes to curse (how this has anything to do with the actual story I still have no idea!).  At one point when a nun is "shocked" to hear mother curse mother surperior responds "Oh Margret get off the cross and get down here with the rest of us".  When the mysterious carpenter shows up and starts to build the staircase, the architect and the contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill the carpenter.  Meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by "God" builds the staircase with wood that doesn't work, is arrested after being falsly accused of attempted murder, and leaves everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better.  In the end the staircase is built and this mother superior (who is on death's door) is so moved that she literally crawls up the staircase in a very "weird"/"uncomfortable" scene until she reaches the choir loft and dies.  Wow, inspiring. The best thing I could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and moving story and turned it into a Hollywood flop. This was obviously written, directed, and produced by people who have no idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it wasn't a miracle because hey, miracles just don't happen. The acting was pretty good but the story was junk.  Unfortunately I bought this movie.    If you are looking for a true inspirational movie that you can watch with your family, rent or buy Mother Theresa with Olivia Hussey.  Hands down the best Saints movie every filmed.  Half way through the movie my 5 year old says out loud "Wow, she REALLY cares about everybody!"  Inspirational movie, compared to this disappointment 
 Esquire is a subpar Men's magazine, in my opinon.  More than half of the magazine is advertisements, and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking.  If you like ads and cologne samples, pick it up.  After all, it is pretty decently priced 
 The most frequent advice the author seems to give, is "Take a sabbatical". Iberra ofers little advice for the person who is ready for change, but simply can't afford to make it. If you make less than six figures a year, you'll find yourself asking "Uh... what am I going to eat while I do that?".     Beyind this, though, the book does deal with how to emotionally navigate the hurdles of being "between two worlds" while changing careers, so it's not a total loss.     Myself, I find that I fell into a career track that I never wanted, and know I want out. I need the financial and navigational help to move back towards where I wanted to be originally, or find something new. This book doesn't provide that, as much as the emotional support needed to convince yourself you really have chosen the wrong path.    If you're wealthy, this book will work for you. If not, you may want to look for another one, as this one has some items of use for you, but you'll have to work to find them 
 This book is a funny phenomenon in itself: it seems that every portfolio manager keeps a copy on her desk, but nobody I've talked to likes the book, or has even really read it.  I read it and had to struggle hard to go from one page to the next.  It's one of the WORST books I've ever read in any field.  The book attempts to give the reader a comprehensive overview of the portfolio management discipline.  Unfortunately, it's extremely dry, to the point of boring the reader to death.  A lot of pages are also wasted on topics of dubious value, while important subjects like global management is treated lightly.  I highly recommend against this book.  It's a waste of money 
 I can not recommend this book.  While reading it I found 4 major errors.  This leads me to believe that the author did not do any research nor did his editors do any fact checking.  The 4 errors I found are as follows: 1. The author states that no trace of the crew of the B-24 Lady Be Good was  ever found.  All but one of the bodies of the crew of the Lady Be Good were  found by the mid-1960s.  2. The author states that Zeke was the allied name  for a kamikaze.  Zeke was the U.S. Navy code name for the Japaneese  Mitsubishi Zero-sen fighter plane.  The U.S. Navy gave Japaneese fighters  male names and bombers female names.  Any WWII historian should know this.   3. The part about the rescue of Eddie Rickenbacker says that a 2-man  Kingfisher float plane spotted their raft and they were picked up by a PT  boat.  In reality, the Kingfisher landed on the ocean and picked them up.   Since the plane only had two seats, the survivors held on the wings and the  pilot taxied across the water to an island.  4.  In the section on the  death of Joe Kennedy Jr. he states that the mission was to attack the  London Gun sites.  This is incorrect, the mission was to attack  U-boat  pens.  He also incorrectly states the crews of the bombers were to bail out  over German held territory.  The crews were to bail out over England and  the bomber would be flown by radio control to the target. There are other  things in the book that just don't seem correct.  I can not recommend this  book.  Mistakes like this make one doubt the accuracy of the rest of the  book.  The author is supposed to be a WWII historian.  If he is, then why  are such obvious errors in the book 
 This is Hemingway's worst book.  It's hard to know if he was going for the "titillation factor" or if he was simply this jaded, cynical and without compassion.  If "three ways" thrill you, this is your Hemingway book; otherwise, it simply illustrates how superficial and careless he could be -- and his writing in this one is pitiful 
 Get the pre-Vatican II version of the Little Office instead. Why? First of all, the proper number of hours for an office is eight: Matins, Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. This number fulfills what is written in the book of Psalms, "At midnight I rise to thank thee" (corresponding to Matins), and "Seven times a day I praise Thee" (corresponding to Lauds through Compline). This is how all Offices, for any religious order, were constructed since the Church was founded. As Yogi would say, "you can look it up!". In addition, the language in the older versions is much richer and more reverent as compared to the trite and banal drivel found in the Modernist translations. All Vatican II reforms are trash, brought to you by the Modernist cabal trying to destroy the Church 
 All this is the instructions and qualifications for how to get PHR or SPHR certified.  I did not find it helpful at all for the price!  It does give a practice quiz (yes, just one) which I suppose is helpful but I would just go ahead and order prep materials and use those.  If you are nervous about standardized tests then I guess it's somewhat helpful because it goes in to how to take them and alotting your time...but if you are well-seasoned in them or any testing (as I am) then I would say don't bother 
 I missed the book club meeting that discussed this book but thought I would read the book anyway because everyone seems so enamoured with Ms. Cleage.  I read the first 150 pages of this book and I am bored to tears.   All of the reviews call this book astonishing; did the reviewers read the 1st 150 pages--nothing, absolutely NOTHING interesting happens in these pages.  Even if the author made up for it in the last 150 pages, this book could not be an astonishing book.  I will not be reading anymore Cleage books.  I, however, will try to finish reading this one since I started it.  My hopes for some excitement in the book,however, has been shattered by the other reviewers who state that the book doesn't even have excitement at the end of the book 
 I purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my Bose main speakers for my surround sound set up.  At that time, I felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as I listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups I came to realize that the Bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par.  So last year, I purchased a Polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane.  The Polk speaker which costs the same as the Bose ($199) was far and away the better product.  The sound is cleaner, crisper, sharper...it made watching movies much more enjoyable.   I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on all these years.  The only reason I purchased the Bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound I have now with Polk center and Bose main is excellent.   Depending on who you ask, the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system.  If that's true then I wouldn't recommend Bose because all you're doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that's a waste of money.  I know because I made that mistake.  
 We all knew that Costes' spirit faded away about the 4th volume. Anyway we didn't miss unity in other opus. Tracklistings were varied and elegant. #7 lost rang, and #8 make you feel sick.   Tracks by Tosca (good Heidi Bruehl despite it's been compiled in lots of places), Mark Farina and Parov Stelar remain to mythical moments of "La Suite (#2)" and "Etage Trois (#3)".  Mixing is bad and when it's good a pc mixed what the "Dj" could not mix (we are inured to Pompougnac's works) and you can perfectly guess where the cut of a track is.  Brazilian dreadful tunes (Zuco 103), hip hop for old snobs who can't throw their Jazzanova cafï¿½-music CDs (Smooth) and music for nappy TV ads (Flying Pop's).  What about Hï¿½tel Costes 60 
 This was my first time reading a Jodi Picoult book and I really don't think I will attempt another one.  The Plain Truth was painfully long, boring and repetitive.  Every character was annoying and unbelievable - especially Ellie and Katie ( the main two). I kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of Hannah but it never came.  Just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in.  The beginning is the only part of the book I found interesting....It went downhill ( extremely slowly) after that.     
 I guess Albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but I'm done with him.  At least I can say I never paid for any of his Oprahlit. Just wasted time at a library. Please don't make this huckster one cent richer. Buy something more edifying.  Like toilet paper 
 After consuming everything Hillerman has written, and learning something new about Native American culture from each book, and after Hillerman's squib on the Dust jacket, my expectations were set so far above what this trite book delivered that even two stars seems kind... As a 1/8 Arapaho [& 1/8 Blackfoot] i had hoped to learn something about their life.  The characterizations were also paper thin, including both the male and female protagonists... and the denouement was telegraphed for miles... ergo, even as a mystery/suspense novel, this one flunked 
 Disk One of is damaged and unreadable by any CD drive.  By policy, seller won't do anything about it.  Seller's on my Don't Buy List 
 Yeah so my dad got me the first book when I was like...15. I successively bought each book as it was printed, and loved them all.  Despite the poor reviews I don't necessarily feel the last one was slow moving, at least not any more or any less than the first three.  Cherryh's lyrical gift is rivalled in the fantasy realm only by Guy Gavriel Kay, who does a SLIGHTLY clearer job with  creating "visible" imagery.  The premise is great, the language is great, the dialogue and characters are great, each having unique personalities.  I'm 23 now and I've read the series again and again, hoping to find something I missed.  But unlike any other conclusion I have ever seen, it doesn't actually end anything, it's not even a cliff hanger.  The details of dialogue and interaction seem to have dribbled off and failed at the final page, with a slight nod in the direction of an ending in a cryptic letter from Tristen to Cefwyn. Sadly, though the writing is mostly gorgeous, I can't recommend it to anyone.  For analytical poetry I read Dylan Thomas or Edmund Spenser.  Art, entertainment, whatever it may be, give me a solid ending 
    I saw Wooden Wand and The Vanishing Voice last weekend and they were total jerks. They played at this small venue with a couple other bands, one of which was from the town where they were playing. They were really rude during their performance and threw stuff at the band, plus yelling out rude comments like "Play quieter so we can talk over your performance". Then when they were confronted for their behavior they said "Do you know who we are?", like they were better than the average human being for being signed onto Kill Rock Stars. I had never seen anything so immature and embarrassing in my life. They have a big fat ego and probably psychological problems. Plus, their music isn't very impressive. Skip this album and look for some good indie rock that's worth your money. 
 Like some of the other books in the Priests series, this book suffered from lack of a strong plot. Salvatore's awesome Cleric Quintent proves that a cleric can carry a story, but maybe the difference is that it requires more character development than bashing bad guys, finding an artifact, or in this case, rescuing someone who betrayed you in the first place and running from were-creatures.  Some of the highlights in this book that should have been delved into deeper involve the secret mage society, the vampires, and the conflict between spellcasters and the ruling family of Luthcheq. Those themes were touched on to a degree, but could have been woven more strongly and would have made the story much more interesting.   Finally, like other reviewers have mentioned, the main characters go through no changes at all. Ythnel, the Loviatan cleric, has no burning issues. She spends the story reacting to things and appears uninterested in what's going on most of the time, anyway. Much like the reader, there is little emotional involvement going on at all. 
 This film is disappointing, considering the acting talent used in it.  The story is about a cop whose son gets into some trouble, and is supposedley framed.  His father, the cop (DeNiro) must try to stay within the boundaries of his job while at the same time clear his troubled sons name of the crime.  It is not very suspenseful and the end result, regardless what avenue they take, is dull.  There is no wonder for who really committed the crime, who framed who, or who will come out the victor in the end of the movie.  It just falls flat and it's to bad that DeNiro wasted his time and talents being in this film.  If you want some great crime drama films that push this to shame, try recent movies like Along came a spider, Man on Fire, or Collateral.  Deeper plots without the predictable outcomes 
 There's nothing "universal" about this product.  It'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones, but don't trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter.  I hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second.  Sadly, I'd bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself, and ALL FOUR died when I tried them with my laptop.  The back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps, which seemed reasonable, so I got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most, so not only is this busted, but they lie on the package.  I managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse, and then it worked for a short time until I started smelling plastic melting -- it turns out even one of the springs inside couldn't handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it.  I give this item two stars only because you might want to plug in two cell phones simultaneously.  For anything else, beware 
      I was not as enthralled with this book as these other reviewers.   As an RN, I know a lot about nutrition, and have studied the subject for many years. I've also studied fasting quite a bit.        One of this book's strong points is the physiology of what happens when one fasts, but I must qualify that by saying that some of its scientific assertions are questionable, if not dangerous. For instance, he says it is fine for pregnant women to fast for 2-3 weeks. Most other authorities on fasting, many of whom are MD's, advise pregnant women not to fast, as it could result in brain damage to the fetus. It is certainly not something I would risk.   Other reviewers liked this author's exploration of feelings regarding food, and perhaps this is another one of the book's strong points. But again, some of his recommendations, in my opinion, are medically unsound. Two examples: First, he admonishes his readers to look deep into their childhoods,at   parental attitudes, and relationships with food, while fasting, in the wilderness.  It seems clear to me that looking deeply into one's childhood and attitudes would be better accomplished in formal therapy with a good therapist, than off by one's self in the wilderness. In fact, a wilderness setting wouldn't be safe.  It is well documented that one can become dehydrated, or hypokalemic (dangerously low in potassium) during fasting, especially if one has a pre-existing condition. Someone doing an extended fast should be under medical supervision, or at the least have other people available. Secondly, one's thinking could become distorted while alone in the wilderness without food for weeks on end. It is the job of a therapist to correct one's distorted thinking in a supportive environment.         Another big problem I have with this book is the author's philosophical confusion. At times he endorses Darwinian evolution, saying we are "evolutionarily" adapted for fasting. Darwinian theory assumes there is no supernatural. But through most of the book this author rhapsodizes on his beliefs in Earth worship, and the "aliveness" of all things.  Remember, he is founder of the Foundation for Gaian Studies (in case you don't know, Gaia is "mother Earth goddess"). He says that a main reason for fasting is to become open to what "the gods" have to tell you, especially about your purpose in life. How foolish to think one can find one's purpose from imaginary animistic sources. There is no purpose without God our Creator, who in the beginning, created the heavens and the earth (Genesis 1:1).         Bottom line, I would certainly be careful with what this author says, and read other authors on the subject of fasting. I recommend chapter 5 of "What the Bible Says About Healthy Living," by Rex Russell,MD, "Fasting: the Ultimate Diet," by Allan Cott, MD, and "Fasting and Eating for Health," by Joel Fuhrman, M.D. Also, go straight to the Book of All Books. Fasting is mentioned 74 times in the Bible. See especially Isaiah 58. 
 I never tire of knitting accessories, especially scarves, even after knitting for many years. That is why I was intrigued by this book.  Lion Brand Yarns has expanded their lines in recent years to include nearly every kind of furry, fuzzy, and bulky concoction one could ever think of.  While I think these designs can be funky and fun, the book offers very little in terms of classic styles that will last the test of time.    Many other scarf/accessory books have come out in the past few months--offering prettier and more classic styles.  Check some of these out before jumping in and purchasing this one.  
 I just watched the recent Frontline about Tank Man, the man who bravely defied the line of tanks in Beijing, and went to Amazon to find books about the subject. Up came this book, among others, and I remember almost throwing it across the room over ten years ago when I read it. You have a guy who escaped, knew a few people involved, and whose only personal involvement is from the outside. He had no balls, and never dared risk himself. Sure, he knows the figureheads, the history, and can write about what happened as if was there. But he was hiding in his room, making himself out to be a hero. If you want to read a book with the only suspense being whether to finish it or not, then this is the one 
 STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS SCISSOR CUTS ..............IT SURELY IS NOT POULTRY, OR MEAT OR FISH................I WILL HAVE TO TRY IT ON PAPER BUT THEN I DIDN'T NEED ANOTHER PAPER SCISSOR !!!!! 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  Although the writing is competent, the story could have been written as a short story.  Based on the reviews, I was expecting a psychological thriller in the tradition of Spider or Butcher Boy.  I found this to be a simple exercise in an overly long dramatic monologue.  
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
  I have not recieved this book and have ordered it twice. My review is that Amazon should not sell things they do not have and cannot get. I have been trying to read the series in order of printing 
 Obviously I knew going in that this movie wasn't going to offer anything more than light low-brow entertainment, but it falls below average for it's niche. Even low-brow humour requires some degree of subtlety and context to work, and those things seem mostly absent in this movie. It's also disappointingly uneventful, so much of the movie is set in the one house where not much progresses. I was hoping the guys' schemes would involve some detours to introduce additional environments and characters, but it never happened. The movie is generally pretty dark too, drawing a lot of it's gags from murder attempts. I guess it's a black comedy, but it's not marketed as such. I think it's inconsistent about what it wants to be. Trust the 7 out of 9 negative reviews on this site and don't waste your time with this movie, unless you enjoyed Big Momma's House.  
 This book is an excellent example of talking down to children and treating them like they are little idiots, instead of intelligent beings who notice things and are trying to get the world figured out. Almost nothing I consider important about the given objects is what Ms. Brown considers important. I pity the poor children who believe it's imperative that apples be round. What, do apples make good wheels? Surely what's really important about apples is that they are food.   "The wind is important because it blows" is exactly the same as saying "The wind is important because it's wind." That says nothing. Tell the children why it is important that air move.   "A daisy is important because it is white." I can think of no reason why it is important that a flower of any kind be white. In my experience, we value flowers in general and daisies in particular because they are pretty. And of course, there's the whole "He loves me, he loves me not" thing, which makes daisies important because they have petals. Color just doesn't factor in.    And so on and so on. This list is complete baloney. Every time I remember that an apple is important because it's round I get pissed off.  It infuriates me that the author thought it's good to tell children this baloney, that the publisher published it, that the book is still in print, and that anyone would treat children as though they hadn't a brain in their heads.   
 Terrible assemble. I coudln't even assembel front wheel. The axle is way short, and no axle nut. So there's no way to place wheel in fork drop outs 
 This seemed too long and too drawn out 
 This book should have been subtitled "the art of  assimilated jewish grandparenting" or "how to keep your granchildren a little bit Jewish".  If you're looking for a book about that buy it.  If you're looking for a nice book about how to grandparent a nuclear, jewishly oriented family, look elsewhere 
 The other two reviewers got it mostly right.  But let me make it clear: this lightly moistened wipes can indeed remove fingerprints and dust -- and even prevent dust build-up for a few days.  The problem is, when the cleaning liquid dries, it leaves ugly fog-like marks on your LCD screen.  I've found out that after it dries, using a lint-free soft cloth to lightly polish the screen helps clean up the screen completely.  But then, I could have just used the cloth to remove cust and fingerprints.  I think these wipes can be helpful when you have serious fingerprints or dirt (not just dust) on your LCD screen.  Otherwise, for most people, this is just a waste of money and can actually make you frustrated 
 What does it mean when a writer of this caliber admits--in interviews and in public, to friends--that he is publishing a book that isn't his best effort?  Lethem is a somewhat talented writer, but he betrays his audience by publishing a half-baked book that serves only as a stop -gap, and then offers it to the film world as a gift.  A gift--Lewis Hyde would agree--is meant to be given in good faith.  You wouldn't hand someone a half-baked cake as a gift. But he gets to have his cake and eat it too by assuming the position that this novel is worth handing over as a gift.  It was light, not finished, and too easy for a writer of his skill.  As Kundera states in his new book: "Artist fame is the most monstrous of all, for it implies the idea of immortality.  And that is a diabolical snare, because the grotesquely megalomanic ambition to survive one's death is inseparably bound to the artist's probity.  Every novel created with real passion aspires quite naturally to a lasting aesthetic value, meaning to a value capable of surving its author. To write without having that ambition is cynicism: a mediocre plumber may be useful to people, but a mediocre novelist who consciously produces books that are ephemeral, commonplace, conventional--thus not useful, thus burdensome, thus noxious--is contemptible."  I don't think Lethem is exactly contemptible. But he is selling out to the idea of fame itself.  
 The book does contain a lot of pens that are unusual; however, I wanted more information about turning small coves or other decorations.  I also wanted some unusual design ideas - not just using different wood or putting in blocks of different wood, but designing the pen itself.  Making it easier to hold or write with or changing the balance or length etc for the purpose of improving the product, not just the look.  Anyway, the book does have a lot of pens displayed and gives the pen turner a lot of ideas about changing the look by changing the wood and how the wood is cut and glued together.  The key is using different materials for the pen itself. 
 Does not keep beverage warm for a long enough time. Construction is cheap and does not deserve the price. 
 I agree with the other reviewers.  This was a major fall-off from the previous books.  I read this a few days ago and I don't think I remember a single story.   Paging back through...did any of these stories have a point?  Let's see:  A story about Cap and the Falcon trying to talk Hank Pym into joining the rebels?  Useless!! (I do think Chaykin's art was a neat change of pace, however.) A story about Luke Cage and how his neighborhood loves him and will stand up to SHEILD?  Enlivened only by the artwork by Mr. Yu. A ridiculous story about Jessica Drew being set up by the new SHIELD b***h and Iron Man, only to be rescued by a splinter HYDRA crew who offers her the position of Madame HYDRA?  Total filler. A story about the Sentry whining and crying AGAIN for another 28 pages??  I don't know who faces greater agony, the Sentry, or the readers subjected to more of his incredible wimpiness.  Why throw the Inhumans in there at all?  Anyone else sick of yet another character's reaction to meeting the ever-silent Black Bolt? The last story was the most plausible, had the most drama and best artwork.  But I question the premise here--was it to flesh out the character of the new SHEILD b***h?  Because in the Civil War mini series she appears as a total robocop undeserving of any sympathy...in other words, a great villain!  By softening her up, it robs her of some of her emotional resonance as the woman you love to hate...but anyway, it was the only decent issue in this collection. 
 This book was a light read. The authors had a really good story line going and the plot had real potential. I liked the characters and was very interested in their conflict, however towards the end the story seemed rushed. The authors took a lot of time setting everything up and introducing us to the characters. The story leading up to the climax was very well written and kept me wondering what was going to happen next, but it disappointed me. It just seemed like they spent all this time on the book and then got tired of it so they finished it off real quick. It was, however, an ejoyable read. -indifferen 
 This was required reading for my British Literature class. It's the only novel in the class that I struggled with and only struggled from boredom. It is entirely possible that I just do not understand the genius that is Forster, but I did not enjoy this novel. A lover of Forster or Modernist writing might enjoy it more. It must be a classic for a reason. 
 This is kind of an embarassment to Jay Ferguson. Why? It is a total sell out to just make money.  Jay was in Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne. These were cool groups. He is far from cool on this album (what a fruity looking picture on the cover. Nice hair do Jay!).  Setting that aside, Thunder Island was big in its time and totally reminiscent of the early 80's. Babylon is a re working of a far grittier Jo Jo Gunne tune. SOulin is ok  This is trying to cash in on the Jimmy Buffet vibe. But Jay was a legit rocker so it is hard to take seriously. Its like if Richie Blackmore sang in a barbershop quartet or Keith Moon sang Brill Building songs.  It is unnatural but definetly a guilty pleasure. Going from Run, run, run to Thunder Island...please 
 More an attempt to cash in on Rice's genre with far less enjoyment than that which was provided by the graphic novels and movies. Unless you like reading the encyclopedia or the dictionary, there's really no reason to purchase this book. Fans of Ms. Rice already know these facts 
 All sane people agree that The Jam was huge on so many levels. I don't care what anyone else says, The Style Council was Weller's creative apex (most people don't appreciate truly good food either). Wildwood is perhaps the best of Weller's solo material but c'mon, it's a shell of his former brilliance. So much of it is generic and forgettable. I saw him live in LA this summer and it was fine, but the creative well of new material is dry 
 The author took a very negative approach to reviewing Disney.  A bit like the National Enquirer.  
 I could have spent the time it took me to read this book staring at the landscape from my window, sleeping, or stretching my neck.  Instead, I chose to read this book--a flagrant regrettable morose error for which I will be paying debt in this, as well as in future life times 
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 This book is without value.  I thought I was going to learn a better way of communicating with my animal companions.  Instead I got nothing but New Age stories.  If you believe in New Age philosophy, you might want to read this.  If you're not a New Ager, don't waste your money.  I rate this book at minus 2 stars 
 I adore Ishiguro.  I was bereft when I finished The Remains of the Day.  Thought A Pale View of Hills was fabulous.  I absolutely abhorred the Unconsoled.  I confess, I read to enjoy myself.  I have a degree in English literature.  I don't have a problem with analysis, but this was too much work to get any enjoyment out of it at all 
 I absolutely loved their previous albums, especially "Legion of Boom".  They went really wrong with this album, though.  It's like some kind of aerobics CD - just a non-stop beat with no imagination.  Their older stuff was much more creative and had rhythms that were awesome.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero because it's still The Crystal Method.  But I really wish I could return the album, it's that bad to me.  Be sure to listen to the sound clips to make sure it's what you want before you buy 
 Almost beneath writing about, this is a K-Tel-ish comp, meaning it's got obvious songs from obvious bands. In fact, you can find 4-CD sets with the same songs for even cheaper. The comp only serves as a reminder that Suicide Girls aren't just a bunch of hot girls on a website, but a fast-growing marketable brand. But the worst thing on this comp, if not on this entire planet, is Alkaline Trio covering "Lucretia My Reflection." NOBODY should ever be allowed to touch that song. 
 I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.  I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.    Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.  Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited. 
 I was expecting something more along the lines of Catch 22, a lot of cussing and sexual exploits in this book.  I found it rather boring. 
 I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.  I feel like the characters have lost their voices.  The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books.  Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books.  I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone.  I tried to start the next book, and it was worse.  Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series.  
 I agree with many of the other reviewers that this book is well written. However, I would not call it a good book. The life of the main character, Rosa, is caught in a downward spiral until she reaches rock bottom and discovers that, in the end, she will always be alone, because everyone she cares about or loves will leave her or die. This is the MOST depressing book I've ever read. If you are clinically depressed or have ever had suicidal thoughts, you should stay away from this book. (This last comment is not intended for shock value -- I truly feel this way after reading the book. 
  The character ,Tree is a 12 year old.Who is 6 feet 3 inches. He feels that he stands out of the crowd. He spends most of his time helping people. His parents are divorsed. Tree has a hard time over this. It is very hard for him to swith from house to house each week. Tree enjoys taking things apart to see what they are really made of. His granpa has to have surgey because he was hurt in the Vietnam War. His grandpa teaches Tree a lot of lessons in this book. Tree meets a new friend named Sophie,he tris to help her with being teased at school.     I learned alot of lessons from reading this inspiring book.  Tree is a very mature for his age. he learns to overcome his size and think of himself as regular person 
 This magazine was given to us as a gift subscription when our son was born, but both my wife and I quickly tired of it.  The previous review that pointed out their lack of scientific research in a good bulk of their advice and their tendency to misquote and distort studies is just plain irresponsible.  The magazine seems to be firmly stuck in a fantasy 'PC' world of lofty goals and ideals for your children that have very little real world application.    Articles about disciplining your children that read along the lines of 'If your 2 year old hits his brothe rin the face with a soccer ball, look him straight in the face, make eye contact and tell him that it is not nice to hit'.  Thanks for that pearl of wisdom.  ANyone with a 2 year old can atest to the futility of reasoning with them.  Never would parents magazine advocate something that might actually WORK like say taking all of his toys away and marching his butt to the corner where he gets to stand for say 9 years or until he is adopted by the neighbors :)  Seriously, the magazine writes for a fantasy land scenario where June and Ward are the parents and the kids act like the munchkins on a Disney TV movie.  if you happen to be the cleavers, go for it.. 
 This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL "democratic" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow 
 this book is like many others and the characters emotions just don't speak to me. it seemed like a kind of uniform book. If you want GOOD end of the world themed books you should try the Fire-us trilogy 
 I was happy come across a book by Chatwin and another title that seemed to make sense to me. But - disapointment followed. This book is full of name dropping and references so obscure to a time and age that is really only talking to the gilded ex-pats of yore that were sitting in their chestnut studies in the colonised counties and it doesn;t go much beyond that. I think the basis for better is there in, say, the chapter "the Morality of Things" but published as it is, it is still unformed. The same goes for the Nomad chapters. Basically, these works were left unpublished for a reason. They should have stayed that way. Bruce has died and we should just appreciate his words from his own hand. I suggest you stick with the real Bruce

 The cover blurb made this book sound amazing; if only it were as complex and fulfilling as it sounded.  The book is very dependent upon Katherine's character, yet she simply didn't mesh for me.  She didn't come off as dangerous or interesting; she sounded more like any immature, impulsive, hard-drinking twenty-two-year-old. And the plot seemed bogged down in a "Groundhog Day" scenario, the same scene happening over and over.  There were snippets here and there that showcased talented writing; I agree w/ the other reviewer that Sabina Murray seems more suited to short stories. Over all, the book seemed poorly edited, with no real cohesion or feeling that the plot was moving forward 
 It's too bad i cannot give Zero stars, because frankly this book deserves that poor of a rating.  Let me start off by saying this is my first "Cat" book.  THis will also be my last "Cat" book.  THe main charecter was a likeable guy and the setting seemed good in a small town.    HOwever, im still wondering what the hell is this book about?  It reminds me of the Seinfeld episode when they are pitching their Pilot to NBC.  "It's a show about nothing."  This is a book about nothing.    I thought the book was going to be good because it starts off fast w/ a missing hiker who ends up getting buried close by Qwill.  However, we never learn how this kid ends up there, what was the cause of death was.    This book was 287 pages of Qwill running errands.  Stopping by here, getting that. It's like the story was based around Qwill's projects (nothing that was interesting or related to the so-called "mystery").  Please avoid this book like the plague. However, if you like to read Mysteries that involve 284 pages of the main charecter getting Nails for mounting something on his wall, and 3 pages of the mystery being revealed then this book is for you.  
 I was tempted to toss this book into the trash after reading the first two paragraphs that pronounced God dead and the character Anna master, oh, excuse me, mistress of the earth.  But then I begin to wonder just what kind of point was this author trying to make. I forced myself to trudge forward with the novel and found the story line and characters quite novel.  But too many times shivers ran down my back as the author pronounced, through the heroine, Anna, her hatred of people, especially those who believe in God.  How can anyone who cares so much for plants and animals wish for "an Old Testament God to visit the peak with one of His famous scourges: a lightning storm that would blast the rock clean of cloying humanity".. 
 Give me a break. This book was absolutely ridiculous. I appreciate the spiritual encouragement, but the weak plot was enough to make me sick. Apparently, the author has no idea what it is like being a single, 30-something Christian woman. Just a few of the "are you kidding me???" moments in the book: ~Whitney wears a JUMPSUIT (yes, that's exactly how it is described in the book) on her first business meeting/date with one of her many love interests. Now, I realize that fashion isn't everything, but a JUMPSUIT?  ~The main character is ready to accept a proposal from a man she barely knows. (This is a man who she knows hardly anything about...she can't even bring herself to ask if he's a Christian. And, she naively assumes that he hasn't pursued anything physical because he's just a good guy.) ~At one point, Whitney realizes she has LOST weight but has "been too busy" to notice. I polled half a dozen friends. None of us have ever had this happen to us...no matter how hard we prayed :)  The list goes on and on. I'll admit that I had to finish this book just to see how it ended, but I was rolling my eyes the entire time.   I'd love to see more Christian-based chick lit available, but this was a pathetic, failed attempt to rip-off Bridget Jones 
 When I first began reading I found the stories to be unrealistic but thought that it may still be worth reading.  For Example: The man who hits his child because the child said they had gone to a specific place only last night when they actually had gone days/weeks ago. His claim was that the child was a liar. Anyone who is interested in bringing up a well child would not behave that way and certainly a person like that is not interested in reading a book to improve their parenting skills. Anywho, I thought this book would give me creative ideas with discipline when the book is really about, as Tucson Toddler Mom said, common sense ideology.  I was most disappointed in their advocating "crying it out" (Yes, H. King they did advocate - check the "Sleeping Single" on pg. 130) and their bias against co-sleeping. They cite Alfred Adler as their co-sleeping "expert" who wrote junk psychoanalytical theories in early 1900s. In the section "sleeping with Parents" on pg 136 the writers write: "Some people believe children feel more loved and secure when they sleep in their parents' bed. Other experts believe children become demanding and dependent when they sleep with their parents......."  Note the "other experts" as opposed to "some people" They are using the ole' "people in white lab coats" ploy to tilt you to their opinion on the subject. Shame on them! This is when I quit reading. They don't want you to hit your kids but it's ok to leave them crying and alone in another room for no good reason.  Of course, you probably now know that my husband and I are a co-sleeping, non hitting parents and IMO, babies were not intended to sleep alone. Otherwise the dingos would drag them away and eat them! More seriously though, I believe as some EXPERTS do: Co-sleeping has far more benefits than negatives and I don't believe that "crying it out" is ever an option. If you differ then this is the book for you ;) 
 such a waste. read Jesus' Son instead--it's amazing. this...is...the dullest thing i have ever read. my book club hates me for it. they will all get Jesus' Son for xmas 
 The features that made the 5th edition so helpful as a reference, like separating the book into sections according to the type of host (ie: dog, sheep, horse, rodent), and showing photos of the parasites that commonly  are found in or on that host, have been removed.  Additionally, some very  common parasites are not even included in this 6th edition!  Rather than a  good reference book, it has now been reduced to somewhat of a primer on  parasitology, one that introduces you to 'types' of parasites, rather than  one that actually enables you to recognize characteristics of one parasite  that distinguish it from another, similar parasite so that you can  specifically identify it. This book is no longer useful, as the previous  edition was, for reference work. I do not recommend it 
  	Picture this, you're a regular kid, trying to make friends and fit in, and the way you do it is by committing a robbery. That isn't the smartest thing to do, now is it? You decide that it won't be a big deal if you just "look out" while your new friends do the real robbery part. Then, your plan backfires completely on you and you end up in jail. This is what happens to Steve Harmon in Walter Dean Myer's novel titled Monster. This book is a realistic fiction novel and not a very difficult read. Walter Dean Myers does an amazing job of showing what Steve is like. He makes Steve an easy character to relate to by making him like any other kid. That's just until Steve gets put into jail!  This book is written as an autobiography that the main character writes...while doing time in jail. Why did Steve end up in jail? Simply because he was the look out of a robbery? Nope, you have to read the book to figure out with specifics! I would recommend this book to almost any type of readers of all ages. Especially for people like me that enjoy reading Walter Dean Myer's work. It is written fantastically and I think could be one of Walter Dean Myer's best! 
 The cover of this album describes it as 'Leave-taking from the British Folk revival 1970-1977' and that was indeed a period worth commemorating.  This collection, sadly, does not do it justice.  There are only 13 tracks (and only 9 artists, as 4 of them appear twice) and what there is in no way represents the best of the period.  The Watersons were a great group, but Lal Waterson, singing solo on two of these tracks, is painfully out of tune.  The other performers on this album are fine, and are well worth a listen, but you will find them all better represented on other albums.  I realize that this selection is restricted to recordings from the Trailer label, but I cannot believe this is the best they could do.  Both quality and quantity are lacking.  A sad leave-taking indeed.  
 I got this book for my husband hoping he would have something interesting, fun, and helpful to read while I read 'The Girlfriend's Guide' and it turned out to be awful.  The book is written for a very immature man and was dumber than it was funny.  We threw it away after attempting twice to read it 
 "Oleanna" was a very, very frustrating read for me. First of all, a lot of it probably has to do with the fact that it is meant to be seen and heard, not read. Nonetheless, I'm convinced that a lot of the frustration is intentional. Everything the characters say is mixed up, incompleted, and confusing. The author, or playwright, Mamet, seems to have a very condescending opinion, almost disgust, for the English language. The confusion and misunderstanding is written in a way that makes our language appear almost pointless. I can't help but thinking to myself that anything can be put in a bad light, and shown to be a source of evil and violence, but why make a point of it (at least when its fundamentally unchangeable, like our basic language)? From my reading, I took the conclusion of the story to be something like "Language is futile, and fails us when we need it most." Of all the things I've read in my college literature course, "Oleanna" has been the only thing to leave a distinctly sour taste in my mouth.  Perhaps I'm missing the beauty of the writing, or the composition, or something... but overall this seemed to be a very mean spirited and ultimately pointless read 
 Not much new here. You would be hardpressed to get any benefit from this book. It doesn't grab the atttention of the reader.   
 The book makes a great argument, albeit unintented, on the ill effects of immigration on second and third generation ethnic Americans (yes, some insist on this "ethnic" fantasy). If your field is Sociology or Anthropology, you may find this book informative with respect to the self-mutilatory social  practices of those Americans who do not feel fully accepted. 
 On this recording Joni Mitchell sounds like she's singing in a bad piano bar. Never thought she'd be a lounge singer. I've listened to this CD only once because I want to remember her as the Joni Mitchell of the sixties and seventies 
 I'm already somewhat intuitive, I get the gut feelings, chills, sick feeling when the thing being guessed about is negative, the sense that something is just wrong, or I'll have something come to me that won't make sense but will later on. These things are mentioned in this book, and for that I'm glad, as it will clarify what intuition means in that sense. However I feel the book may lead those less knowledgable of what intuition is and what it feels like and what it's good for to some wrong conclusions. The book goes down the road of new age beliefs rather than practical uses for intuition, the whole "you create your reality" stuff which does not have much to do with intuition. Intuition is that feeling that you "just know," creating your reality is what you focus all your thoughts on all the time and how your life forms around those. Not the same thing! Also it talks a LOT about doing 'readings' and about psychic stuff, leading one to believe that intuition is focused on others and on the far future, and I've found this to not be true at all. Intuition does not have to be premonitions or asking someone a bazillion questions to pull info out of them until they tell you what they want to believe.   Also, the exercises, Exercise 4 claims to be you using your intuition to make answers to a bunch of phrases, such as "a man's name." However, I've found that the list, my answers which I did not give much thought to, were not some random intuitive message, they were in fact many of my favorites. It asks you to choose a color...most people will be tempted to put down their favorite color, not some magical psychic message that has some huge meaning behind it. The book also asks you to take all your very abstract random responses to questions asked in the book and then apply them to a question of yours that is not even remotely related to those random responses you had, and to make up a response that foretells the future for that question. It's just like asking a magic 8 ball a question and getting a response. You know the answer and question don't actually go together.   It is unfortunate that this book is on the market, leading people to wrong ideas about what intuition is, how to use it, and what it can do for you. There are too many new age-y books that rely on quick thoughtless exercises that claim that everything all fits together in the large universe so everything MUST have meaning, however, think of this: if everything had meaning, even the shape of your bowel movement must have meaning, or the sounds your shoes make on the pavement have some magnificient meaning. That's what this book wants you to believe. It has nothing to do with intuition, it is disguised spiritual b.s 
 Maybe I made a mistake starting with a book that's 3rd in a series without reading the earlier ones first. I gave it up at page 118 as I just couldn't get engaged by the characters.  My previous experience with the Anita Blake series led me to this book hoping for a gutsy heroine and lots of action. There is action and descriptions of odd characters with extra eyes and magic skills. Guess I didn't make it to the sexy parts, as they mostly were talking about it, trying to be lyrical, but somehow the characters weren't coming alive for me so I gave it up.  I didn't want to pan this book entirely, knowing Laurell Hamilton's abilities, she might pull it together, but I just wasn't willing to keep soldiering on hoping for a turn around. 
 The book certainly had occasional interesting points. The author does know his history. The story could have been told in 400 pages. 
 Okay, the concept of this game cube is great, and believe me: you will spend many hours trying to solve this puzzle. Now on to the reality... I first tried this brain buster in the eighties when it came out. Upon its first release, the stickers stayed on, the plastic squares didn't break off, and it just seemed like a higher quality piece. I beleive the plastic might have been heavier. But now, twenty years later, the stickers peal off, the squares pop out. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!  If this was made in the USA it would now cost more than it does being manufactured over seas, however ...it wouldn't be junk. You get what you pay for.  Stephen John Beccia Author of The Treelanders 
 Sorry folks, this is not a serious book by any standards. Much of what Shenkman has to say is either unproved speculation or purposeful misunderstanding of events and indeed of history itself. Please do not take this as a serious effort. It is not 
 I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen.  As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story.  It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing.  The story's decent.  The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go?  Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe?  It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one.  A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work 
 This review concerns the original 1932 edition and the revised edition published in the 1960's.  Both books follow the same plot; although, the revised edition is slightly different from the original.  While returning from a carnival, Nancy, George and Bess witness a large home suddenly burst into flames.  Thinking that there may be someone trapped inside, the girls rush to the house to help.  They are unable to enter the home because of the heat, but Nancy spots a man running away from the house and later finds a diary, written in Swedish, which contains numerous technical drawings.  Did the man start the fire?  Does the diary belong to him?  And what became of Felix Raybolt, the owner if the home, who apparently has gone missing?  Clues lead Nancy to suspect that the diary belongs to the husband of a poor woman that Nancy met at the carnival along with her little girl.  Nancy becomes determined to prove that Joe Swenson didn't start the fire, but all of the clues she uncovers seem to suggest that he is guilty.  Personally, I didn't find this book very good; there isn't much action, the mystery isn't very exciting and the book really lacks a true criminal.  Thankfully, the writing style used in the book is rather enjoyable, so it keeps the book from being a complete waste of time.  One thing to note about this book is that this is the volume where Nancy meets Ned Nickerson and oddly enough her first thought of him is that he is trying to steal her car!  This book is worth reading for the writing, but its not likely that many fans of Nancy Drew will find this book to be one of their favorites 
 The author borrows from several world belief systems and tries to pass them off as ancient "toltec" wisdom.  It does contain sprinklings of common sense, but the common sense is offset by impractical application as well as impractical implications.  Furthermore, the author contradicts himself at times.  On the other hand, if you are a fan of Deepak Chopra you will probably like this book as it is in the same vein.  
 The field of vision is too small for any useful viewing.  If you already know where your object is in the dark, then you can point this device towards the object and view it in dark.  But if you are searching for an object in the dark, the small field of vision makes the search useless.    Also, there is too much "noise" in the image, thus making it very difficult to recognize the object that you are viewing.  The IR makes the field of vision even smaller.    Overall I did not find this device useful even for ordinary pleasure viewing.    By the way, if you own a camcorder with night-view, you already know how how the objects look in the dark.  You can use your camcorder's night view feature instead of buying this expensive devic 
 Before this misguided book was published, DDT was successfully reducing malaria deaths across the globe.  After it, and the subsequent ban on DDT, millions of people have suffered and died needlessly.  For example, in Sri Lanka in 1948, there were 2.8 million malaria cases and 7,300 malaria deaths. With widespread DDT use, malaria cases fell to 17 and no deaths in 1963. After DDT use was discontinued, Sri Lankan malaria cases rose to 2.5 million in the years 1968 and 1969, and the disease remains a killer in Sri Lanka today.  Carson' science is dodgy, her conclusions false and her prescriptions plain wrong.  Do not buy this boo 
 If you're a big fan of the Frank Peretti novels such as "Piercing the Darkness", you might enjoy this story of evil, demons and semi-Biblical themes. As a Christian, I found the parallels to the Bible to be interesting, but not compelling. In fact, these parallels were the only thing that kept me reading. In creating this work of fiction, Meyers goes well beyond the biblical descriptions of events-and this is fine. The problem I found was that Meyer's writing style is a bit annoying. It seemed like everything was measured in yards-the truck was getting closer and closer, 20 yards, 17 yards, 13 yards, and so on. It just didn't ring true with me. Meyers is fond of telling us that tears "burn" the eyes of his characters. And there are elements of the plot that seem contrived to add to the story. Sarah, a research scientist at a parapsychology lab drives an old car with a bad carburator. A single woman with a high-paying job would fix it or replace the car; she wouldn't put her safety in jeopardy. But Sarah is "too into her work". Even after the bad guy attacks her and her car fails to start when she tries to run away, she still drives the thing. In fact, the very next day she's giving her boss a long ride out in the country in it-even though her boss has a fancy car back in the parking lot. Another nail in the coffin is that even though Sarah's attacker's identity is known nobody calls the police. This leaves him free to commit more crimes that add to the story. And it goes on.   I'm afraid that Christians desperate for this kind of literature will artificially inflate the popularity of this book. It's really not a high-quality work 
 I've read Wicked first and perhaps that was where the mistake lies. Wicked was so well written that after reading such a great novel, Confessions was somewhat of a disappointment. It's not a bad novel but the character development was just par and the storyline seemed a bit forced. I would love to recommend Wicked though for those who might be interested. I even bought the soundtrack from the Broadway show 
 I was very excited when I first bought this book years ago.  As a naive grad student I thought I had found a treasure chest of information, but I quickly found out that I was very wrong.  There is a lot of information in there, but most of it is simply not verifiable.  This should be taken the same way as The Golden Bough by Frazer.  As it is quite a large book, the least one could do is recycle it and use it for a doorstop!  There are several other reviews here with examples, so I'll refer you to those 
 I can't remember if Doctor Wallach is mentioned in his book or not but the other day I came across this man's site, promoting his book. He had a listing there about Doctor Joel Wallach. Within the first sentence he said that Wallach claims that all diseases are a result of mineral deficiency! Amazing...this is how he calls Wallach a quack? With a complete and total LIE. That's right. See I have Wallach's books. My family takes his supplements. I am part of Wallach's company email: Ekowal459@aol.com to discuss it further if you're inclined, etc. Now, I have also listened to DOCTOR Wallach's seminars in about 20 different variations and have health successes of my own as a result of him. Never once does Dr. Wallach [BS,DVM+ND] or his Wife Dr. Ma Lan [A Microsurgeon MD with a Masters in Science and liscensed Acupuncturist], ever come within the neighborhood of saying that all diseases are caused by mineral deficiency! This is insane and completely untrue. Furthermore he discredits Wallach for calling himself a physician by the implication that a Naturopathic doctor is NOT a physician on the grounds that he is NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR. Once again a moron who can't understand how someone who's primary means of health care for patients is not pharmaceuticals can be a legitimate Doctor. So by his standards Osteopaths are not Physicians? No one can heal anyone else unless they dispence pharmaceuticals? Oh that's right, Naturopaths can dispense pharmaceuticals in state's which allow it...like the one Wallach trained and worked in...interesting. And Wallach does recommend some pharmaceuticals where prudent...he's not a lunatic. He talks about what an outrage his claims are? Such an outrage... I have one of his seminars on tape where he is speaking to 200 DOCTORS. Why would they even show up? This man tries to discredit Doctor Wallach and that which he says which aren't lies are just foolish arguments that make him look like the con artist or just plain ignorant of his subject [Wallach, Naturopathy, Health...etc. Don't waste your time on this man's books. I won't even talk about the positive points in this book that actually have merit because as far as I'm concerned his ranting about Doc Wallach on his site... and in the book, I seem to recall, discredits everything else period.

 Stupefying and moronic is the most apt description of this waste of celluloid. Though made during the Cold War, its portrayal of Russian people is unfairly mean-spirited and in a review I read elsewhere, it was described as xenophopic. I would go so far as to say it is propagandistic. Its the kind of film which will appeal to today's dumbed-down American who thinks he's a little more special than everyone else in the world and that he has the right to blow up foreign villages and otherwise disregard laws and civil behavior. The idiotic characters justly deserved the punishment they received in this pathetic film 
 A theory intends to explain reality and make a truth claim. In this book, the theory presented does not apply to any form of social reality, and its truth claim can neither be verified, neither falsified. The author presents, somewhere from the dimness of deep metaphysical outerspace, a series of half baked philosophical assertions about IR theory that are at best incoherent and erroneous. In essence it is a pot of opportunistic eclecticism that nowhere achieves a synthesis that smells of coherence. Although he wants to explain all IR questions, he achieves to provide an understanding for none of them. What pretends to be a theory is nothing but a wolkenkuckucksheim that demonstrates the limits of a 'science' based on opportunism rather than truth, and its devoted students would probably continue joyfully to sing its praise even if it had been shown to anyones satisfaction that its presumptions were outlandish; because nothing whatsoever would count as a falsification of their beliefs. Do not buy this book if you sincerely intend to learn something about international politics, because there are much better choices around. Although the author might still be regarded as a fashion icon in his field, all he does is celebrate - under the label of positivism - the ambiguous and dubious as positive in itself. (... 
 I bought "Old School - Vol. 2" specifically to get the full-length version of Dazz by Brick, among other songs.  I was disappointed and angry that it was the 5 min. radio version.  After reading your reviews here, I'm glad I didn't choose to get the Best of Brick.  Though I enjoy other songs by Brick, Dazz is my all-time favorite.  Today I found the long version on the "Disco Super Hits" CD.  Though I'm not crazy about other songs on this CD it's worth the money.  I will be playing my Dazz over and over with my sun-roof open, a smile on my face, and the wind blowing free in my hair!  :- 
 I collect 1950s era Sci-Fi and I have been replacing my VHS versions with DVDs.  Unfortunately, I need to keep my VHS version for this movie because the print that Image Entertainment made this from was in such poor shape.  The VHS version by UAV Entertainment (The Wade Williams Collection) is MUCH better.  Hopefully, UAV will come out with a DVD version soon 
 I love Ford harrison movies and this is not a bad story but the film is shot in such dark showdy lighthing by the cinematographer that it is unwatchable that it ruins the film and all the acting, directing and writing in it. 
 I was very disappointed in Blaise's book about Sandford Fleming and the Creation of Standard time. The book goes into some background about Fleming, which I found very interesting. The point incident that leads Fleming into developing and advocating a Standard Time is also very good. Unfortunately, Blaise loses me by changing the topic to the impact that the railroads had on the Victorian lifestyle, and his pages regarding Sherlock Holmes. I was hoping for more insight into the Prime Meridian conferences, but it didin't happen. I thought Hochschild's 'King Leopold's Ghost' a much better historical book 
 I found this book to be very limited in regard to content.  I was looking for more advanced techniques, or at least a more detailed study of actual methods for accomplishing what the title advertises.   The author could have presented the main points of this book on a few pages and saved us all the time required to read the filler material.  Just about any book you pick up about public speaking or personal communication contains the advice found here.  "Repeat the question - It gives you a few more seconds to think about your answer" is about as advanced as the info in this book gets

 This book was informative however please note that it is very US focussed and will not be of great assistance with regards to regulations in other countries.  The book did not provide an all round knowledgebase for setting up a dog walking business - mainly focussed on grooming.  
 Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say "USA" near the top, and they are great pens. However, I have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back to Cross for warranty repair under their "lifetime guarantee," only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a "handling fee" attached.  I was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly, one bad pen. So later on when some new colors came out, I bought two more - only to see that they have the same quality defect.  My advice: if you want a good Cross pen, go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in USA. They aren't making them the same anymore. 
 Do not judge this man simply by his two books - go the distance, and judge him by the entirely of his published work. It's all available for review on his web site.  This is a man who would have you believe that he is interested in moral and ethical behavior, and good citzenship. He is not. His work makes clear that in his view, immorality reigned at the time of Reagan, and reigns now under Bush, but evidently, it was supplanted by the good, moral people during the Clinton years. Right.  This man is at best delusional and crippled by his myopic, tyrannical view. But assuming he is not mentally incompetent, he is worse than intellectually dishonest - he is a propagandist. True scum. Why do I read this stuff? Because a "friend" loaned it to me, and I read it out of respect. Something good came out of it - I was wondering why my friend was so warped, and now I believe I've got some insight into him that I hadn't had before.  Look, I'm sure the world would be quite peaceful if all agreed with Mr. Loeb. Of course, the world doesn't work that way - and in the real world, rational people have keep our guard up against such "ethicists." This man's work, and in particular his evident credo, is simply terrifying 
 The amount of praise given to this work does not surprise me given that there is a widespread, yet subtle, socialist movement in America as well as in Europe.  Despite this, the book is a failed attempt at reconciling the ideal with reality.  Rawls commits one of the many age-old flaws of collectivism, attempting to force morality on immoral beings. Rawls' entire work is fundamentally flawed in that the hypothetical situation from which the entire theory relies, selectively allows certain knowledge, assumptions, etc. while conveniently eliminating others.  For instance, empirical evidence that shows capitalism outperforms other economic systems cannot be known in the original position.  This is profound when one considers that we live in a hostile world that requires nations to invest in security of which economic power is imperative.  Thus, capitalism may be a necessary injustice in order to safeguard liberal democracy.  If we compare the human condition prior to capitalism, one can see that perhaps a collectivist system that may contribute to capitalism's downfall is immoral, if it leads us back in this direction.  Consequentalism perhaps?  Despite this, the people in the original position cannot have this knowledge.  Therefore, information that is direly relevant to the construction of a social system in a hostile world cannot be used in determining its structure.  Somehow though, the people do understand the important of the right to vote, equality, etc. This is absurd and impractical.  Rationale beings need to analyze as much information as is available and pertinent to any decisions they make.  Rawls continuously attempts to explain his "tweaks" as rationale but it is obvious that they are all implemented in order to discount human nature and proceed in theoretical terms.  On a side note, Rawls' first principle calls for the right to vote, what would his state do if citizens began to vote for a more capitalistic system that defied his "justice"?  Iron fist?  Nevertheless, it is quite obvious what Rawls is attempting here.  In a hypothetical situation where we all have to fear being born without intelligence, strength, status etc. we will take the safe route and ensure ourselves the highest index of goods.  This may be true, or it may not (human nature seems to embrace risk taking) however this situation is irrelevant because of its exclusion of relevant information.  Hobbes for instance accepted human nature and the potential for a wide array of circumstances in his hypothetical Natural Condition.  While Rawls may have some strong arguments in declaring that his two principles are the epitome absolute justice, this does not mean they are practical in a hostile world.  Essentially, what Rawls is saying is that none of us deserved to be born intelligent, responsible, hard working, but that we were simply lucky in the natural lottery.  Because of this arbitrary distribution, he believes that we all must compensate for those unfortunate souls that were born unintelligent, lazy, and perhaps even immoral!  I'd admonish Rawls not to attempt applying his insane reasoning to the criminal justice system (Poor, unfortunate murderer).  If Rawls believes that the laziest, dumbest, and most immoral person still deserves a living wage despite not working, he has contradicted himself in that this justifies slavery, forcing individuals to work for other individuals without compensation.  This simply cannot be justice as "fairness".  Nevertheless, I'd recommend it to all free market advocates simply to strengthen their positions.  As a warning however, be prepared for a work that lacks brevity, organization, coherence, and most importantly, reality 
 If you are a busy person, you work a lot with programmers and you need a general understanding of programming, this is not the book for you.   If you have time on your hands, and you want to learn VB, this could be the book for you. After I bought this book I realised I was fooled by the title.  It should be called 'Programming in Visual Basic for beginners'.   The point of this book is to teach you to program in VB6, not to teach you the basics of programming using VB as an example language.  While I can understand that the verbose classroom approach may appeal to some, I found it patronising and time wasting. I eventually bought 'Sams Teach Yourself Beginning Programming in 24 Hours' by Greg Perry which gives a concise summary of programming basics, an overview of the most common languages, and exercises to drive home the lessons. Exactly what I was after.   
 is this a cover of Social D's sick boy?  and if youre looking for a good album, get one of theirs 
 After reading the great reviews regarding the VCT870RM tripod (here and elsewhere), I decided to purchase one for my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder.   When I first opened the box, the VCT870RM seemed sturdy and well made.  The tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch, and the remote controls on the handle worked well.  However, the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan, the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly.  It felt like the tension control knob was tightened, but that was not the case.  In fact, the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed.  I recently found a VCT870RM review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning.  However, due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod, I'm assuming that I just received a bad one.  I'm now in the process of working with Amazon to get a replacement sent to me.  So far, Amazon has been great, as they've already scheduled UPS to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day.  They say that I'll receive my new tripod next week.  I'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives.  UPDATE:  I received a new replacement VCT870RM tripod from Amazon, and this one works great.  Panning and tilting are both very smooth, and the tension is adjustable.  If I'd have received this tripod originally, I would've given it 5 stars.  The first VCT870RM I received was definitely defective.  I'm glad I returned it, and I'm glad I bought it through Amazon (best price at the time, and a hassle-free return) 
 Dr. Leman is a typical writer who can only think within his own personal world.  He has no concept of what life is like for those of us who have a spouse who is not like Dr. Leman, nothing at all like him.  These idealistic ideas of Dr. Leman's are just so much fluff.   Dr. Leman thinks everyone lives in his wonderful world.  Shame on him for taking the money from hard working people who just want to do their best to raise their children inspite of all the obstacles in their own households 
 Again, I'm a forgiving guy, but this thing is overpriced by about $20.00 for the quality you get.  C'mon.  It's a wind up unit which lasts barely a few minutes, no where near enough time to be enjoyable, and the brightness level is deplorable.  You need to place it as high to the ceiling as you can get it reasonably for it to project a decent 'light show', and my boys room gets pretty darn dark.  This is product number 2 from Discovery that is just some overpriced chinese junk.  I'm OUT!  Save your money 
 After volunteering to look at this play for my Classics degree, I started out with high hopes.  But after opening it and dicovering how boring it was, my hopes faltered.  I still gave it a go though and a couple of hours later when I finally got ready to start writing whether it was actually good enough as a play, my problems started.  Bearing in mind that it was written 2500 years ago, i was intrigued that a play could last for so long.  But honestly, thats where my interest stopped.  It's lenghthy and dull, and although I know that it is a very historical and precise play, I just couldn't follow it.  If you want bedtime reading that will send you to sleep, this is the one, sorry 
 I did not like the book Adam of the road because it tells you a whole bunch of stuff about the characters before it gets to the story and by the time you get to the story you forget about the characters. I also did not like the fact that the book talks weird and it says like thou father I shall bla bla bla 
 Lived by the sea. Ok--that is how creative this book i 
 I rented this movie tonight, having vaguely remembered the trailer from 2003.  The synopsis on the box was intriguing enough, although I realized the potential for a hackneyed portrayal of an all-too-common family comedy theme.  I was hoping for a cleverly-written dark dramedy along the lines of a Charlie Kaufman or Wes Anderson film.  What I experienced was a trite presentation of your textbook dysfunctional family.    The film had its moments, but those moments were far too rare.  There was little in the way of character development; in fact, the character who experienced the most development was the dead one.  As screwed up as this family is, I felt no sympathy for any of the characters, and I couldn't bring myself to care about their lives even a little bit.  Even the big revelation at the burial service, perhaps the most interesting moment in the film, was somewhat of a ho-hum moment.    I really had high hopes for this one, but in the end it just fell flat for me 
 This is an extremely important topic, and it is interesting (even intriguing) to read Sanders' and Fackre's atypical views on this subject.  However, Nash does not make a positive case -- WHICH IS EXTREMELY  FRUSTRATING!  Both Fackre and Sanders readily express their frustration  with it, which can only lead the reader to exasperation.  If you want to  engage this issue, check this book out only for its bibliography.  You also  may want to read Fackre's argument as it is intriguing and well-written --  you'll never read First Peter again quite the same way.. 
 "Theory in Landscape Architecture" is a compilation of essays, articles, and book excerpts from numerous authors spanning a period of more than fifty years. It seems as if Swaffield went out of his way to include only the driest, most boring, esoteric, and inane essays to include in this book. Nearly all of them are incredibly difficult to read. Many of them are so abstract that it is nearly impossible to discern what the author is trying to say.   Writing is a form of communication, and if your readers can't even figure out what you're saying, you are not communicating well. In that sense, this book is an excellent example of what happens when a bunch of very intelligent, talented people with dismal communication skills sit down in front of a typewriter or computer and try to explain what's on their minds. In short, this book is an ordeal to read 
 On avrage, I read fast.  I read a copy of the edition that was 264 pages.  Normanly that would take me 2 days.  This boring book took me about a week.  From the begining, this book was dull and hard to understand.  I would NOT recomend this book to anyone who doesn't history fiction.  It had some crude parts, as well 
 I agree with one reviewer, in the fact that this book is just WAY too full of useless information.  80% of this book is filler.  I couldn't even weed through all of the needless information in order for this book to make an impact on me.  I was reading, and kept drifting off, because I simply didn't care about most of what he was saying.  I wanted to become a 'Great Communicator'.  Instead, I found my patience was being tested!  I don't recommend this book for anyone who doesn't want to know every little nit picking detail about certain things like the origins of language, and certain common sense things, which he explains in FULL detail.    No need for this book 
 The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is the story of Roland Deschain's quest to find the man in black, who will lead him to the Dark Tower  On this journey, Roland travels through gritty rundown lands, often times lost in thought, reflecting on his past and all that he has lost. And thus becomes the pattern of the story. Roland travels and thinks and travels some more.  I did enjoy one childhood story in particular. He challenged his teacher and fought with a raven as his weapon. It proved that he was willing to sacrifice others, even a bird in this case, to further his own cause. This is why when we meet a young boy named, Jake, we know his fate is doomed as well.  Jake's story fascinated me. He was in New York City and the man in black ripped him from his world there and dumped him in the middle of the desert in Roland's world. He is a small glimmer of hope to an otherwise jaded story.  I had a hard time reading this book. At first I thought it was because I don't normally like western flavored stories, but my love for movies like Tombstone and shows like Deadwood have proved that's not always the case. It turns out that I just don't like the hero of the tale.  I think Jake was added to show us a softer, caring side of Roland, but it fell short. He knew he'd betray the boy from the beginning and we knew it too. Only, I wanted it to be something big when it happened. The big scene was a big let down. I remember thinking, "Wow, that's it? Please tell me that's not it."  I know heroes are not all supposed to be charmers, and I'm not one to mind if the hero is crass and ruthless. But no matter what, I found that I just didn't care about Roland or his plight or anything in his world. I couldn't attach myself to them.  What I enjoyed most in this book was reading the introduction King wrote since I always love reading when he writes about creating stories in general.  And well that's that. I have the next 4 or 5 books in this series and I haven't yet decided if I will continue it. How can I read more if I don't like the hero, eh 
 I will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference BUT ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works...we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall, charging for days at a time, and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck. I had ignored a review I read similar to the one I'm writing just before I purchased this imonitor, I learned my lesson!  Purchase with caution.    
 This OBDII reader is way too simple. Doesn't really do much in diagnostic. Could not reset anything. Save up and buy a bit more better unit 
 I read most of the reviews for this book. I don't usually post reviews. But I just had to for this one because every time I read it, it leaves me wondering and asking more questions. It seems so superficial since it gives you a gist of what's going on (like stuff that's happening 5 years ago) and we are in 2006. I look for Park Hotel Tokyo. Not there. They opened in 2003, shouldn't they be in that guidebook? That revision was done later than that. So I took a trip to my local Borders store, and took a look at TimeOut Tokyo's guide book. That book was so much more informative, I really wished I could get a refund. Trust me, this book, sucks.  
 Four stars for some very tasty raw recipes. Zero stars for propagating nonsensical junk science. None of this stuff has any proven published clinical studies in peer reviewed journals to back it up. The darkfield blood mycology & parasite stuff is a total scam and simply runs contrary to biology. You blood is generally sterile, not full of fungus or bacteria. Fungus doesn't convert into other forms of life. Bacteria don't convert to fungus. Just as humans don't convert to whales or daisies. The pleomorphism of Enderlein has been clearly disproven with modern molecular biology methods, it is simply a holdover from days when modern methods weren't available. Good scientist that he was, Enderlein would likely change his theories today, given the realities of modern methods of study. Even Cousins' interpretation of Ayurveda is incompatable with the extensive use of cooked food, dairy and often meat in that paradigm of health. This is *his* Ayurveda, not the real thing. Tastes good though. Just don't believe the theories 
 I got this as a gift for Christmas, and I've tried it twice so far. Both times I get the same result - it doesn't work. I understand that with wet hair, it won't dry it, obviously. But even with damp hair, as instructed, it doesn't get my hair dry. As for the actual straightening aspect, I still end up with frizzy hair that isn't even all that straight. It's not worth the money - spend the extra bucks and get a Chi or Infrashine, you'll be a lot better off 
 Whatever felicity Edwards manages in this work, do not credit the ideas represented to Edwards himself.  All of his central points on freedom are no more than a Christian appropriation of secular English philosophy in Hobbes, somewhat in Locke, and certainly of David Hume.  In the old philosophy, choice is an illusion, because in any course of action we are determined necessarily by our nature; Edwards agrees fully, adding only that our nature gets some extra help from God when it comes to sanctification.      He advances the idea that in every snapshot of human life, we make decisions in accordance with our nature and disposition.  Free will is compatabilist in that we have no autonomy other than to follow our greatest desire in any given instance.  Not only does this exposition rule out the chance for true virtue--some good thing we do which we might not have done--but Edwards also has a hard time explaining how God is not the author of evil, given that human decisions are consistently determined according to a divine decree 
 I made the mistake of not watching this before allowing my 3.5 year old to.  I don't consider myself overprotective, but these stories have a kid abusing a dog (Pluto), a kid having his pants pulled down and being spanked over someone's knee (including showing the kid's bottom from above), and Donald chasing Chip & Dale with a revolver in the first 2 cartoons among other things.  I turned it off after that.  Talked to several other friends to see if I was overreacting & they recall seeing that kind of stuff when we were little but all agreed they don't want their toddlers seeing it anytime soon.  Was a little surprised this made it out of Disney especially in today's day & time....May be okay for older kids, but I don't really want to explain guns or why it's not funny/okay to abuse our dogs to my 3.5 year old 
 Neil, I've listened to you since 1979, seen you play 35 shows, and have turned on about 300 of my acquaintances to Rush in the past 27 years. I played in a band that played Rush songs as 85% of our show. And I even modeled my kit after yours several times.If I had known you hated fans the way you do, I would have stopped seeing you play years ago. You complain about people too much! You speak too prophetically about all the great things you've done, and the tragedies bestowed upon you, yet you put religion down and make fun of people as if you haven't learned a single lesson. Not all drummers never grow up. I'm a drummer, and it takes serious concentration to be a good person with little judgement, than it does to play paradiddles and ratamacues.Lighten up, dude! If you don't like touring and you only do it for the money to "pay your bills," then get a job cleaning motorcycles and make yourself useful. Here's a church sign for you: "God permits U-turns, unless you're Neil Peart."  It sucks that your so talented, but you could use a little schoolin' in the human being department. The only thing that kept me reading is my disbelief that you could be such an incredible arse 
 Don't waste your time or money.  What she wrote in the First Theme Gardens is enough.  If you can't find the first one then this is a good book, but as a REVISED and UPDATED Edition the changes were very subtle 
 Yes it is true that you need special learning to understand Pound.  I did my undergraduate thesis in Pound and I am still confused.  I am now a student in Biology. Pound said (somewhere) that biologists are the best scientists because they observe the world. He thought scientists were stupid otherwise.  Since Pound I have discovered Dawkins, Ridley, William James, E. O. Wilson just to name a few authors.  They make sense to me.  Get the Cantos only if you are really dedicated to understanding one man's view of history and culture. He really believed that culture particularly past cultures affected people.  In this sense he was a behavioralist.  A little science would have helped him. This book is a throw back to the age of the oral narative when gods came down and took possession of a person. Somewhere in the Cantos he says : "The Africans have more sense than the Greeks"  who says?  Where is the proof.  He thinks he has found some. Also he writes: "We should keep our promises to the Arabs" maybe that is true.  I wonder, as a follower of Musolini would he be a follower of Osama today just to get into hot water and be controversial.  Like Homer he was blind as a bat! "A serious Character"  a biography of Pound is a good read.  
     I agreed with many of Salereno's points about the current self-help gurus.  They do perpetuate the need for themselves and often sham people.  However, that is about the only sane thing he has to say.      What I adamantly disagreed with was his attack on homeopathic medicine and feminism. He shamelessly blames feminism for bad education and boys' bad behavior.  Feminism is not to blame for the failure of our school systems!  There is no logical leap to be made here.  He merely twisted his words and the studies around to support his prejudices.     He also quickly discredits any use of anything outside of western medicine.  While standard medicine is important, it isn't the ONLY approach that works.  His arguments are far from fair and balanced.     Finally, for all of his complaining, Salerno offers little in the way of solutions. (Which is what College Freshman Composition 100 should have taught him)  He hints at things, but doesn't create any clear ideas for his readers of what needs to be done.  He'd be happy if we could turn back time and do away with the woman's movement I think, which is what he seems to think is the root of all of today's evil.  (Have you noticed most of the positive reviews are mostly from males and not females?)        
 This bit of capitolism bashing is not a bad novel, but if "1984" is worth five stars (and we all know it is) then this amusing, if somewhat forgetable, narrative can not be given half its status.  Anyone who gave this book three or more stars should certainly re-evalute their opinion with the above paragraph in mind. Though, perhaps I have under-rated the book based on lofty expectations provoked by his latter work.  Anyone who may have given this book five stars:  Do you honestly think this first novel is the equal of a titan of literature like "1984"?  It simply doesn't deserve the same status. 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 'some times ago, I bought the 'HOT SPOT' CD after watching the frugal  Hopper film with the same title, featuring Don Johnson. The music itself makes me always missing the singings.  The Instrumentalists will be as good as ever, but the whimpering from the selfnamed 'Father of the Electric Blues' will not !!! do.'  AH  my favourite title on the 'HOT SPOT CD' is the last one: 13 'End Credits'. TA 
 This is the WORST transfer of a movie (that is not a tape-to-tape before DVD bootleg) that I have ever seen.  Many scenes in the daylight show a jiggling reflected lights, or so it appears, and lines dance around with the sound.  It was so bad I thought it was in individual damaged DVD, until I read other reviews here and on IMDB.  This is far worse than most cheapie transfers that are no longer owned but are in the public domain.  At least in those instances they usually have the excuse that the print they are working from is old and worn.  I have a much better video of Exodus on VHS tape in EP!  And this movie is currently being offered at Amazon for $14.95.  Don't bother!  Tape it off TCM and you'll have a far higher quality visual record.  As for the movie itself, despite good actors and one of the most wonderful music scores, it's very flat.  Kirk Douglas would have been a far better choice than Newman, who acts like he just came off a binge after a losing pool streak.  Nonetheless, it should not be sold with in lousy visual copies 
 I read so many good reviews of this book that I had to get it for the Halloween season. It begins with an interesting and mysterious premise but soon evolves into pages of story with little excitement. I am at the last 5o pages of the book and perhaps I will find out why everyone else found this book so good. An antique book seller and his daughter operate a dusty old shop with valuable books. The daughter is invited by one of the top authors of the day to write her biography although she has been a recluse and resists others attempts to find out the truth of her life. The common thread between the author and biographer is that they are both twins. I am married to an identical twin and I am baffled by the excessive concentration on this one topic. Wait for it to go on the discount table 
 If you want to keep from being shot at beaten up or go to jail avoid whatever this author has written 
 Sadly, this is just a waste of your money. I can't think of anything nice to say about it. It's sad that a man who has recorded several albums of his own plus numerous hit singles  finds the need to sing songs which his brother, Barry, made famous. I was deeply upset to see that he even recorded Barry's signature song "Words".   Robin has a voice of his own and should try to sing songs fitted for his voice. He needs to step back and realize that one person does not make a Bee Gees. It required all three of them to create the magic.   
 The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.  As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide.. 
 Ah, Pierre, you lusty Frenchman, where do you go wrong? Actually the main character Pierre is an American in the early 19th century who is well-off leading an easy life, until suddenly a mysterious woman crosses his path, who happens to be his sister, that he has rather strong feelings for, not to mention the creepy way he calls his mother sister in the early part of the book. Overly dramatic, it reads as if Melville made it up as he wrote, since so many crucial facts and events are suddenly mentioned with no foreshadowing or even hint of them. It does have a brief amusing chapter that attacks critics as people who praise medicore writers that risk nothing. Melville desperately wants Pierre to be like Shakespeare's Hamlet, butt alas, Pierre is much too flat and shallow for that. Aside from Melville Scholars, this novel isn't worth serious reading and skimming a few chapters would demonstrate it's many problems. Go for "Moby-Dick" or "Bartleby the Scrivner" for a real sense of Melville's writing 
 Full of holes and alot of overbearing personal philosophy.  I found myself crossing out lines of this text, as so much of this is conjecture and hyperbole.  The chapter on Violence is worth the cost of the book, however, I would recommend going to the library and saving your money.  Some directors swear by this text, thusly it is a potent force in the contemporary theatre.  However, many of these ideas have been chewed up and misused by so many inexperienced Bogart groupies that it has little more validity than, say, a Richard Foreman text in its extremely self-referential nature.  
 Perhaps Puffy only got as far as he could riding on Biggie's legacy, but lets face it, he really has very little talent, charisma, charm and just seems so dull, he is basically a male Paris Hilton, going around acting like the world's biggest d1ck ny saying "look people, I got money, arent I cool" besides Biggie(RIP), Bad Boy really is not great, most of the artists are poor quality, The production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial. This album is basically not even worth printing or existing. It is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like Diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on TV. I don't know why people like Tupac, Biggie, Dimebag, Chuck Shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths. So I would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and D4L deserve, a 1 star rating.     
 I have owned this unit for 2 years.  The water seems OK and definitely better than from the tap.  However, every 4 months or so we have to change the filter because we start to have a chlorine taste coming back.  The replacement cartridges are very expensive.  There is a little knob on the faucet that you pull to switch from tap to filter, and this knob recently has broken off.  We cannot seem to access the company's website to get a replacement part.  I am thinking to get a different water filter system altogether.  I would not buy again.  (Also, I have had lots of problems with their water bottles...leakage, breaking, etc.  I won't buy any product from this company again. 
 It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
 Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one.  I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels.  Morrigan's Cross disappointed me.  Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist.  I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood.  King was a comic relief, but he got killed.  That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it.  I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy.  Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself.   
 The title - "A Deficit of Decency" - is more than a bit ironic, given Miller's obnoxious performance at the 2004 Republican Convention and subsequent "Hardball" interview, and his long record of political back-stabbing.    Miller's non-stop misrepresentations of Sen. Kerry and other Democrats at the 2004 Convention were deliberate and inappropriate.  Further, one wonders how Sen. Kerry "got to be so bad" after Miller's 2001 speech praising him as an American hero, or why Miller didn't step up to defend his fellow Georgia Sen. Max Cleland when Cleland was being viciously and inappropriately attacked while running for re-election, or why has he now forsaken former President Carter - with whom he worked for many years?  I do agree with Miller about the need to improve immigration control, the general lack of decent sports and music role models 
 The criticism that a lot of the perfume and aromatherapy community has leveled at this book has been that there is nothing in this book that is not already in print.  I'd be willing to agree with that.  Considering that Chrissie Wildwood is out of print, and that Arctander and Tisserand are hard to find inexpensively, this book is an okay stand-in for those which preceded it.  It is not the final authority however, despite the glowing reviews.  Get the original works from these three authors if you possibly can, if you consider yourself a perfumery scholar 
 On Tuesday November 30, 1982 I had just come home from a scout meeting, and I turned on the television, and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper, and told me to turn it off, and I didn't even know the name of this. I looked it up in the TV Guide later on, and unfortunately, due to the fact that I was still shaken up by the other night I didn't dare share the name due to the fact I'd get a sermon. I was at a crucial age in my life where I was 15 where I had desires for girls, but emotionally I was not prepared for them. I can understand the fact that it's a morally bankrupt film, and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution, but I don't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world's been turning, but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that. I guess looking back my parents argument is "There's a time and place for everything", but guess what that would've been a perfect time to help me understand. I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win. I feel with this movie I had to not let it go until I got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it's entirety, and I didn't get to see this until I was 20, and I brought it back up to my parents as my father's friend had just opened a video store in Cherry Hill, NJ., and the battle started again. I have felt like a eunich I didn't get to watch this movie all this time, and when I did I found it rather appealling, and now wanted to add it to my collection I was getting flack as I actually bought the blank video, and tried to get it copied onto the videotape. Looking back I would've been better off just buying it, but I know I have to wonder if I would've come to same conclusion. I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal. I saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from. I didn't focus on the colors, or the scene where Ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by Elaine, and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson took away Ben's virginity, and this was when Ben was trying to get together with Elaine. I found this to be coincidental, but rather truthful when I had a woman make a phone call one night when I was working in a convience store, and it was a rather seductive one, and then the woman just turned it off when I finally met her kind of like Mrs. Robinson doing it to Ben, and especially when he was in too deep. The fact that this happened could've been an alternative lesson my father could've taught me if he didn't want to talk about the sexual nature. With this mindset I don't own this anymore, and have no inclination, or intention of owning it again. I can't honestly say if I bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would've made a difference. I feel that once I saw the fact that Mrs. Robinson made a blank promise to make Ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me. This is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to, or it's implied that it's a man's job to have an affair, but that's the world's standard, and morally it's wrong for either side to cheat on one another. It left me feeling that I wasn't worth the time to talk about this movie to, and about the way the relationships in the movie, and made to feel dirty because I wanted to know, and angry that I had to repress myself, and my feelings, and my character to fit this model that pleased my family. I just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it, and not worry about your parents helping you. Mind you it is a PG rating, so anyone 13 and under not without a parent. 
 As much as I would like to recommend this movie, I have to admit it is not one of the best movies of Jesus life. It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word, which is, at times, a useful tool.  That said, the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies. Marchiano's poor acting often evokes laughter in the group.  If you what the best Jesus movie ever done, nothing beats Zeffirelli's TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth.  The two other parts to this series, Acts and John, are done very well. 
 When I listen to this CD I stick to two songs, #3 & #8.  I find that out of all of the songs these are the only ones that give a glimpse of Hewitt's talent.  I find that the rest of the songs are a product of bad production and poor writing.  Ms. Hewitt can definitely sing, but what she really needs is a strong team to help make her tallent shine.   I gave the CD 2 stars, one for each song I like.  
  "Nothing's okay," Westgate Penitentiary inmate Joe Collins (Burt Lancaster) says, "I gotta get out."  That's because the sadistic screws are keeping the otherwise tractable inmates down with BRUTE FORCE.  You treat a man like an animal and he turns into one, right?   At least so sayeth the usually reliable director Jules Dassin in this overripe movie about a prison on the edge of explosion.  You see, the bad guys - the inmates - have a backstory, told in a series of flashbacks, that proves they're good guys under the prison grays.  They just got hooked up with bad women who made them do bad things.  Flashbacks don't lie.  They don't necessarily entertain, or keep a movie chugging onward at a comfortable clip, but they don't lie.  The prison officials, on the other hand... the otherwise decent warden is weak and vacillating.  The avuncular doctor drowns his reprehension in brandy, emerging from his alcoholic stupor  periodically to crack wry about the inhumanity of it all.   The baddest good guy is Capt. Munsey (`Sir' to you), Hume Cronyn, an effete sociopath with a blood taste for dishing it out (he seems particularly fond of whips) and a penchant for the insinuating seduction.     I wanted to like it, but as BRUTE FORCE plodded forward, piling melodramatic excess on melodramatic excess, I found myself fighting it.  Fighting the notion that everyone in effective authority was a heartless goon, the ineffective ones were broken (presumably by the ruthless System), and the inmates were misunderstood choirboys.  Despite its good looks, good performances and exciting final scene I had too many "Aw, c'mon" moments to honestly say I liked this movie.     The transfer print is in good condition, and the disk includes a hands-free Stills Pressbook Gallery with a number of behind-the-scene photographs, publicity stills, lobby cards and posters. 
 My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.  I think this book is on the bottom of my list.  It was a combo term paper and novel.  I wonder where the editor of this book is.  Where was he/she?  It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.    Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor. I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape. 
 Boring and irritating. Not one character is likable, and not one character is 3D 
 A familar pattern is that a band will improve over time, gaining more fans with each release, until they peak, and then go downhill. RATT is a band that didn't follow this pattern. With each successive release, they lost more and more fans and starting with "Reach for the Sky," (1988) the quality of the band's music started to decline until they hit rock bottom with "Detonator" (1990).   This album just plain blows. It's bad, really bad. While early RATT wasn't brilliant and was basically just derivative of David Lee Roth era Van Halen, the band rocked. They wrote edgy, catchy songs and churned out some of the best music of the pop-metal genre. "Detonator" sounds like a band that is tired and all out of ideas. The album would be bad enough, but Desmond Child is the final, fatal blow to an already mediocre collection of songs. He injects his own unique brand of candy-assness to the album, ensuring that the whole CD is devoid of any edge or good songs.  Guitarist Warren Demartini comes up with some good riffs and solos, but Desmond Child's dreadful ideas and Stephan Pearcy's awful attempts to sing power ballads are just too much to bare. And the album's lyrics i.e., "Lovin' you is a dirty job" are some of cheesiest ever. This is pop-metal at its worst. Only completists or masochists need buy this album.         
 Our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed (and I'm an industrial designer Dad, so I should know!). It can hit the door frame easily, the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height. He's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it. He has fun in it at first, but it always seem a disappointment in the end. Save your time and money and get the Baby Einstein Excersaucer. THAT is agreat toy and better for development skills

 I'm always looking for good mystery stories, and bought this first book in the Inspector Banks series thinking it sounded promising.  Sorry to say, I found the dialog stilted, the interactions of the characters not realistic or adult, and the women's lib angle poorly expressed.  If it werent for the violence and sex, it'd be a better read for someone in junior high school.  The professional characters, like the chief inspector and the psychologist, seem awfully inexperienced for people in those kinds of jobs.  Part of the reason it seems corny is that it doesnt stand up well after 20 years 
 It's too bad Mr. Ridley doesn't put as much effort into examining the effects of the social environment as he does into genetics. Obviously genes have an important effect on behavior...DUH...what else is new? Mr Ridley need to enroll in graduate school and spend several yrs. researching the effects of social structure on behavior before he writes another book. He grossly over simplifies research methodologies while displaying his biased opinions based on anecdotal information. This book is not a balanced discussion of research but a vehicle for his poorly-informed views 
 What was the point of this film? There is no lesson learned, no story to tell, no entertainment factor even associated with it. I guess it was an excuse for Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming to try to prove that they have no imagination and get their Hollywood buddies together for 2 hours of nonsense. 
 So I saw this one live action Alice in Wonderland movie and it sucked!!!! But I'm confused this isn't the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie, I think it is. I'm not sure if I want to risk boring myself with other crap... so will I watch this verison ever... who knows 
 I purchased these sheets in Feb. I washed them per the manufacturer's instructions before putting them on the bed, they never got that far! One of the pockets on the fitted sheet was torn so badly that it can't be resewn, the stitching on the sheet is very badly done, it looks like it's ready to come apart on the other pockets too. I am sending them back. The reason I rate it 1 star is because it's a beautiful color (blue) and feels very soft & thick 
 I've had this book for several years, but I found that it rarely had the formula I needed.   However, it is fun to read, so if you just want to get some inkling of typical problems and solutions in fields outside your own specialty, then this is a good book to have 
 I purchased this to display MPEG movies (which it says it can). I was told by tech support that I had to use a DIVX encoder and that they must be AVI (which is also incorrect). The SANYO Xacti video camera I was using was MPEG-4 (The iPod accepts the files without issue), I tried converting them in Quicktime to several different types of MPEG4 and none worked. There are better frames out there and I intend on finding out which one is the best. I have ordered another brand and will see if it works. This was by FIRST product return on Amazon. 
 This book was AWFUL - I tried to use it to prepare for the SAT II and was appalled at the out of date questions, as well as the sample tests, which test you on subjects absolutely irrelevent information 
 I can't believe that other reviewers gave this book 5 stars. I was completely disappointed. The book included very little useful information  to help kids make good nutritional choices- "fruits and veggies are awesome" was about the extent of it. The text is uninteresting and cumbersome to read aloud, and the illustrations are not appealing. I am returning this book 
 I'm surprised by all the rave reviews this book has received here.  True, the illustrations are beautiful.  However, the story is about a series of events that culminates with a monkey killing a baby owl (with an illustration of the poor little owl getting clunked on the head), and then progresses with the mother owl's mourning period.  My 3 year old and I both find it disturbing -- not exactly a good bedtime read 
 since there is little to no mystery involved in the story.  I should have expected this, since this has been the trend for the last 4 or 5 books in the series.  I had put off reading this one for precisely that reason but needed something to read for the weekend so I decided to give it a try.  The best thing that can be said about this "Turkey" is that it's a quick read, so it's good for a plane ride, but if you want something that remotely resembles a mystery pass this one up and read one of the first books by this author which really were engaging and satisfying mysteries.    Even as a glimpse into the small town life of Moose County this one falls flat.  It used to be that one of the charms of the series was the way Braun had developed the world of Moose County and all the foibles of its inhabitants and if tragedy struck one you really felt for them.  In this book, characters from previous books are randomly introduced and they wander around aimlessly and there is no emotional depth to Qwill's relationship with any of them.     The other problem that has happened to the series is that Braun fell in love with her own character.  Qwill started the series as a flawed charcter.  In "Turkey" there is even more rapturous description of Qwill's mustache and wonderful voice than usual, not to mention the ovations for the ridiculous Big Storm production.  We are supposed to believe that it is so well received that there are to be several performances a week throughout the summer - how big is the population of Moose county?    SPOILER ALERT:  But to cap off the ridiculousness of this book, Qwill leaves his beloved Koko out in the gazebo with a confessed murderer who is strung out on drugs.  The Qwill of past books would never have intentionally put either cat in danger like this.    According to her fan club web page, she was born in 1916 so now she's pushing 90.  It's possible she's in poor health. Because of this I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and agree with those who suggest this book was ghost-written based on notes she made.  That would account for inconsistencies in plot and style.  The only good part of this book - the only reason it deserves even one star - is the description of YumYum playing with her thimble (but even it is taken from another of Braun's books).  It's on page 72 - read it, then find something else to read.          
 If I wanted to read an egotistical self-congratulatory book, I'd pick up an autobiography. If you want to learn about real estate investment, this is not the book for you. I was very disappointed. 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this. I'm approaching my 40th birthday, and wanted to hear how others had dealt with this transition. In all fairness, Ms. Braun does interview many women on their transitions. However, the language is superificial, sometimes to the point of being annoyingly "cutesy". For example her term "Fertile Void" which is defined once, is used as a critical thread throughout the work, as though it's a sociological phenomena. If the book had been written about that term specifically, maybe things could have been interesting.  OK, there is a period of time where one doesn't know which path to take, but I hate labels, especially cute ones, especially when applied to grown-up women facing serious challenges. I need to lead myself into new terrain, and find my own voice, and I don't need cheerleading and labels. I found the "rah-rah" attitude really lame. Worse still, the term "F-You Fifties"...I'm sorry, but I got over that language a long, long time ago. I don't think it's amusing.  One of the "success stories" was from a woman who, when she lights up her joints (marijuana) today, has much more pleasant trips. Frankly I felt offended and patronized, and I am no prude...I grew up on Ms. magazine, I went to a Seven Sister school, and I'm from NYC.  I was truly expecting More, as in that wonderful magazine for which Ms. Braun works.. 
   I'm calling on all decent, patriotic Americans to boycott Newman's book.  I've had him for two US history courses and all he does is spout anti-american sentiments and convince students to hate America.  He would rather we'd never fought the revolutionary war because he believes the rich started the war and used the poor to get richer, never mind that Washington turned down kingship.  Do yourself a favor and don't listen to anything Newman has to say.  Don't waste your money buying a book from a man whose sole purpose is to spread anti-american propoganda to impressionable college students.      I swear, some of what he says about present-day America could come straight from an al-Qaida training video.  So steer clear of this literature terrorist 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 Being from Houston TX, I never really like alot of southern music unless it was like scarface or the getoboys...The south may be popular now because it's a easy way to recongnize just get some wack club beats and talk about clubbing or ice you got a hit...It's a easy sound to get like junior high kids to lsitened to what happened to the gutter rap about hustling and gangbanging and what happened to actually good production like rap from the 90's...The g funk beats need to come back street talk needs to back when rap was about pushing the boundries not being a bunch pussy like 90% of rappers are nowday's...And for the record 50 cent not a gnagters rapper he makes trl songs for 13 year girls and boys well g rappers dont do that(candyshop) that;s hardcore please...He might been shot 9 times but he doesnt rap like hood rapper... 
 For an accurate biblical view of Israel read or listen to, "The Future of Israel" by John MacArthur 
 More of a toy than a bike.  Training wheels clearly say "do not remove."  Returning this.  Fortunately Amazon's return policy is awesome.  Thank you Amazon.  Ordered a different item to replace this from you 
 I am very dissapointed at this book. It seems like this is a 4 year old book. But don't worry i am going to order more Baby Sitters Club this time with mysteries! I am really sad at this book= 
 I thought this book would deal only with the 2nd Iraq war but was mistaken.  About half this book described the history of Iraq.  The actual war coverage was broad and brief.  This book lacks much of the detail of previous Keegan books.  John Keegan has written many superb books in the past but this one was a disappointment 
 Waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. Ha Jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books I have read. National Book Award? Hmmm.   Waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, Lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. When Lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--Manna Wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. Everyone in Waiting waits...and waits...and waits.  The book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the Chinese communist state. It lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as Manna, and even Lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). The book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha  decorated piece of literature. Ha Jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us 
 This book sounded good:  An alphabetical listing of nearly all recent movie stars with a discussion of each star's worst film.  To qualify, a film had to be both a commercial and critical disaster.  Only problem is the authors appear to have written the book over a long weekend.  The entries are very short -- usually a page, sometimes less -- and contain almost no background on the films, apart from their box office take and, occasionally, quotes from reviewers.  We all know Halle Berry's a fine actress and Catwoman was a bomb.  Why not tell us how she came to make the film, what problems the film encountered in production that made it so bad, and so forth?  The authors did essentially no research that might have enabled them to discuss these issues.  Instead they provide a brief summary of the actor's career before and after the bomb under consideration and make a few smart remarks about the movie itself.  They would have to be far wittier than they are to pull this off.  In short, if you are movie fan, you probably already know everything you will read in this book.  For a much better book on the same subject, check out James Robert Parish's Fiasco 
 Paul Johnson has written many bad books, but this one tops them all. He says he wants to refute the notion that "great forces" rule the history. What he really hates about Napoleon is the fact that he was French. Johnson has spent the last thirty years worshiping the British Empire and in this book he attacks Napoleon for conquering other peoples. Pure hypocrisy and utter waste of time from a bitter old man 
 I was bored - really bored, which is why I picked this book to read from the free book trade shelves at work.  It has a good basic story but is so formulaic that I was able to predict the ending after the second or third chapter.  Being a medical professional, it was difficult to read about procedures that are outdated now and remember when they were cutting edge.  Perhaps it's also a bit scary to remember those I've worked with in the past who have had the same narcissistic outlooks.    I think I'll pass up the other books by Dr. Cook that I have not read as of  yet.  This is the second one of his that, in my opinion, bombed miserably 
 I usually like Deaver's stories, but I actually only made it through half of the book...then tossed the thing. I am not crazy about the subject matter when it involves children (even if they are at the teen stage). Should have paid more attention to the info at the back of the book. And I definitely don't need to have obscenities every sentence. My mother always stated that people who swore constantly had nothing of interest to say. I find this to be true, even in my choice of literature. My time on this earth is too short to waste reading this type of material.   So I am a prude...  Karen Sadle 
 Although I love the Engelbreit line and own a lot of it. This calendar definitely is NOT what I would call a pocket or purse item. It is large, has heavy cardboard covers, and only shows one week at a time. I will be buying something else and giving this to a niece to play with 
 This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read (listened to).  I was never able to find a plot, and even though no one ever had sex in the book, everyone was always thinking about it and wanting to.  Not very realistic.  And, sorry, Jonathan Morosz, but the narration couldn't have gotten any more monotone 
 The only reason to read this book is if you're really bored, because it has nothing new to offer at all. While the writer is satisfactory, all the story does is rehash the past. Nothing important happens. So, its basically as though the author has turned an episode transcript into a narrative. For someone who's been obsessed with btvs, especially Spike, for a long time--it was a real disapointment. It's basically a kids book and Buffy was never really a kids show 
 I recently read "I", "K", and "L" in succession.  Compared to "Innocent" and "Killer", I found Lawless to be slow paced (even though this edition finds Kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country) and the plot twists less surprising.  With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line.  I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome.  Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...).  I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in "L" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.  Anyway, there are others in this series I would recommend more highly ("M" being one of them) 
 Bought this one for Evolution class. It is a horrible excuse for a textbook. Do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student. If the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience, then I would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend University of Washington 
 I love the music on this DVD.  It's wonderful to hear many of John's best solo works in 5.1 surround; BUT that's where the praise for this release ends.  While some of the video is inoffensive, most of it is simply political and personal Ono promotional propaganda.  I felt as it she was in the room picking my pocket.  And what she did to the "Happy Christmas" video is a crime!  I'll never be able to listen to it again without images of dead babies coming to mind.  Yes, Lennon was a peace activist. I get it!  But give it a rest Yoko.  My advice is to either pass on this DVD (and buy the CD) or turn the cr@ppy video off while listening to the beautiful 5.1 mix 
 I read this book a while ago (I was a self employed exec recruiter for fifteen years) and it still stands out as one of the silliest. The amount of information either a Manager or another headhunter will glean from this material is negligible. The pages discussing her "schedule" in which she shows us all how hard she works are so laughably self-important that you should skim them in the bookstore for humor's sake. 
 I bought this book in the hopes that it would help solve a toy/food aggressive guarding behavior in a 30 lb dog of mine. The book instead told me how to recognize aggression. Thanks I got that already. If your dog has a real problem you will need another book 
 I purchased 2 sets of these earphones for a 2 hour flight. My husband and I both used them, and we both took them out of our ears after 20 minutes. They were great at first, but after 20 minutes they really started to hurt our ears. The inside of my ears were so sore I couldn't even adjust the earphones when they started coming out, that's how bad my ears hurt. I had the foam pad over them too, and it made no difference. I would not recommend these 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 This book is not as good as i thought it would be.  I hope i have better readings with Bryan Tracy's Advance selling 
 I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.  I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.    Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.  Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited. 
 Ahh, so the illustrious Robert Jordan has graced us with a prequel.  Great.  More Wheel of Time to digest.  So how was it?  Honestly, it wasn't that bad of a book.  Much shorter than his usual efforts, the pace moved along faster than his later WOT installments (for the most part), and some interesting stuff in there about the end of the Aiel War, Lan's part in that conflict, and his eventual meeting with Moraine.  Sadly, those storylines mentioned above occupy only the beggining and ending of the novel.  Pretty much the entire middle is filled with the same dredging, monotonous crap that ruined books 8-11: namely, women bitching at each other.  I clung to the hope that the female characters in the prequel would not be subject to the same plague of whiny, insecure, petty bickering than has infected every single woman in the later WOT books.  I was violently disabused of that notion.  Young Morainne and Suian are sad dissapointments.  They are not the young and inexperienced, yet determined and formidable women you would expect.  They are carbon copies of Elayne and Egwene - stupid, jealous, unbelievably fickle characters that make you want to scream.  And a good 1/2 of the novel regards their day to day activities in the Tower: fetching tea, worrying about the Mistress of Novices, staging sorority girl pranks, and all that other crap we've already been through with Egwene, Nyneave, and Elayne!  Get to the point!  Did the book really need to be written?  No, especially with the end of the actual series looming, and so many loose threads still to tie up.  All in all New Spring was not terrible, but I really wish RJ would focus his effort on producing a few good books to wrap up Wheel of Time.  Then maybe he can start screwing around with prequels - if anyone is still interested at that point, and the way it's going now, I would say very few would. Count me out 
 This is a bit of a muddle.  Not professionally written or reported--there is no hypothesis, no facts, no linear thinking that takes the viewer through the evidence to arrive at a conclusion.  Don't waste your time or money on this one 
 Myth #1: American women live under patriarchy   Myth # 2: America's the World's leading threat to the environment   Myth # 3: America is a racist nation   Myth # 4: The Untied States is an imperial power.   Myth # 5: The rich get richer, the poor get poorer   ALL FACTS.  Plus, The higher the IQ the more liberal someone is. Ben Franklin, Einstein, our founding forefathers like Thomas Jefferson...all liberals. The lower the IQ the more conservative because it is easier to not think for yourself. I love America, but changes need to be made.  Rome fell too eventually from bad politics 
 This book is just for new fans of vampires. The information that konstantinos brings here is just hours of browsing in the web. Every single topic is on the web. He just going to save you hours of web searching,but the information is for begginers. I doubt of the knowledge of magic of Konstantinos.I gave the book 2 stars, just for the trouble of collect all the web pages and make a book  with them 
 Of all the textbooks I've had, from elementary school through graduate school, this is easily the worst one I've ever had, for any course.   First of all, the authors so redundantly use the word "whilst" and the phrase "rules of the game" that it really gets on your nerves. My classmates all agree with me on this point.   Second, speaking of getting on your nerves, half of what these authors say is, "...as we talked about in the previous chapter" or "as we'll talk about in the next chapter". There is so much redundant language in this book that it really could be condensed to about 25% of its size, and hell, it probably could simply be a chapter in the text for some other course.   Third, the authors should win a Pulitzer prize for flowery language. They seem more interested in impressing me than educating me. Their sentences are far too long. They don't know the meaning of clear and concise, and I think they should all go back to English Composition 101. They'd be great politicians, because never have I heard anyone say so much and yet say so little....over and over and over again.  The book is a like an inflated academic paper...and it's BORING. If ever a topic begged for a case-study approach, it's this one, and this book is not the answer. Save your money, and beg your instructor not to use this text.  
 i got to get it off my chest.  this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful.  BUT, the camera has several down sides:   1. as all have said, it eats batteries big time.  this is a pain.  2. it recharges slow between flash and between non flash.  forget about catching a great spontaneous moment.   3. not durable.  i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at ALL.  i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable.  any suggestions??? 
 I will admit that I too read this book cover-to-cover and was intrigued by its story. The problem is, I became so engaged that I began doing subsequent research into the field of remote viewing and, appropriately enough, began to "see the truth." Psychic Warrior is a highly fictionalized, exxagerated, self-serving vehicle for its disgraced author to exploit his fleeting brush with the RV program for money.  David Morehouse had the shortest tenure of any of the Army's remote viewers who have gone on to make a living as "experts" on the technique. According to those fellow viewers, most of the "exploits" in RV that Morehouse takes credit for in this book were actually accomplished by other people. The best example is his "Mars expedition," which was in fact conducted by Joe McMoneagle. An actual transcript of Joe's session is available as a bonus with purchase of Skip Atwater's book "Captain of My Ship, Master of My Soul" and it more or less proves that Morehouse is trying to take credit for someone else's work. The Psychic Warrior book is full of events and accomplishments that Morehouse tries to take credit for, most of which actually occured when Morehouse wasn't even in the program.  In fact, most of the revered remote viewers (McMoneagle, Ingo Swann, Russell Targ, Paul Smith) seem to consider Morehouse to be the RV community's "odd man out," especially after he was forced out of the Army for having an affair with his enlisted driver's wife among other things. That part of the book is even more suspect; Morehouse continually makes excuses for himself and tries to paint himself as a victim of some sort of government plot as a result of his threat to "expose the truth" about RV, instead of taking accountability for his illegal and immoral actions.  But two facts must be considered here: First, the Army itself declassified the program and released mountains of information about it; it is highly doubtful that they would make attempts on the lives of Morehouse's entire family over something they were already planning to open the lid on. Second, practically every other significant member of both the SRI program and the military's program has gone on to write books, author instructional materials and even teach courses in remote viewing, and not a single other one has been "targeted" by higher powers as Morehouse claims to have been.  If anyone out there is interested in reading about remote viewing and its history within both the civilian science sector and the military/government, I would highly recommend that you read Paul Smith's "Reading the Enemy's Mind" instead of Morehouse's fictionalized waste of time. Smith, who acted as unit historian for the Army's program, provides an infinitely more reliable, intelligent and engaging account of the development and implementation of remote viewing. And if you would then be inclined to study the technique yourself, I would suggest you examine Skip Atwater's course at the Monroe Institute in Virginia before plunking down the $1,000 + to study with Morehouse. After all, Atwater spent years training most of the viewers in a program that Morehouse was kicked out of after only a brief time.  I wouldn't have had such a problem with Psychic Warrior if it had been marketed as a work of fiction. It is a shame that such a perversion of the truth ends up being many people's initial introduction to something as significant to humankind as remote viewing. 
 While it is commendable that the author avoids the verbal fakery, jargon and obfuscation so common amongst academic authors, it is hard to imagine a flatter, duller narrative.  The evidence on offer here is anecdotal and therefore of limited value, and since the anecdotes are so mundane, there seems little reason to read the book.  Most adults can furnish their own supply of similar stories, have already come to some of the same conclusions, and won't find the insights very insightful.  Sociology remains thin stuff 
 The book does not have a glossary in the back of the book so we can look up words that the author failed to tell us the meaning. I emailed the author and asked him what certain trading terms meant in his book and I received an email back from somebody named "Lisa" that told me to look it up in the dictionary if you can't find the answer in the book. I think this person "lisa" was very unprofessional in the way she handled this email and her customer service skills need improving. There are better books than this one. This man is from another country other than America and he uses weird words to describe his examples. It's hard to understand. 
 Gregor Hohpe should have read past the first 100 pages. This book is good on theory, poor on practice (does that remind you of any other SOA book?).   The examples Havey provides of "non-trivial" systems in the back are, in fact, quite trivial.  What's worse is that when he ventures into the territory of "advanced" features, he gets lost.  For example, on p.270, he provides an eventHandlers section, but comments it out saying that it doesn't work.  I was able to get it to work as written with just a minor tweak, but he slags off the vendor instead (p.284) and proposes an awkward hack for a workaround (p.277).  Then, on p.308, he presents us with a piece of parallelism that depends for its success on the use of a correlationSet.  This is supposed to be clever, but is, in fact, just poor programming practice.  Not only that, but it doesn't work!  It can't possibly, not the way it's written.  He just sent it off to the publisher without testing.  We're not talking about simple syntax errors here... this is a fundamental conceptual flaw in what he's proposing.  Pretty basic stuff for him to be stubbing his toe on.  
 This movie is just so tragically non-believable, that it irritates the viewer and you have to quit on it.   Good cast, but what stupidity in the script. Are they serious letting us believe that a serial killer is re-enacting crimes from an almost 100-year old novel.  And so Angelina Jolie goes to a decades abandoned meatpacking storehouse and can still smell the manure??????  Duhhh --- the place has been abandoned for decades. More non-believably, you mean to tell me a real estate developer hasn't snatched up the property and razed the building. That it has sat undisturbed so that even the manure is intact decades later?  I'm sorry -- when movies use plot devices so amateursishly like this, I bail on the whole project. 
 While it has it's bright moments, there are far better books out their.  I guess I expected more from this author. Hollywood is fun but there are more imporant figures to promote involved in science, engineering and chemistry. Does Jesus all want us to be ornaments?  Give me a break 
 Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping 
 John Irving remains one of my most favorite and respected authors, in spite of, not because of this book.  After reading Garp, Cider House, and a few others, perhaps it is my own lofty expectations for consistent greatness that led to my genuine disengagement with this particular text.   Many of the classic `Irving' traits (sub-plots, interior dialogue, overt sexuality) encompassed the novel but the most important aspect was missing.  Even at the conclusion of the story I could not make myself care for or truly understand Dr. Daruwalla (protagonist).  After 700-something odd pages, (usually an aspect of Irving's style that I appreciate and embrace), I was ready for the novel to end.  And it did, rather expectedly and unceremoniously.  This is not to say that the novel should not be read, it was mildly enjoyable (perhaps because I read the majority of it on the beach), but as for John Irving's potential, it pales in comparison to `his greats'.  Hesitantly recommended for the veteran Irving reader is the best rating I can give this book.  
 This book was not what I expected.  The author spends much valuable time describing his personal trials and tribulations with the Russian "system" rather than explaining the what, how, where, and gory details of biological warfare.  If you are looking for an exciting read, pass on this one...I did read the whole thing and I can guarantee it will put you to sleep every time you pick it up 
 You cannot hear the timer... it is poorly made and was an absolute waste of money.  I love kitchen aid mixers and my kitchen aid dishwasher is the best EVER but, trust me, this timer is AWFUL 
 The book covers a fascinating subject because Porfirio Rubirosa was among the top playboys of his day. However, the writing style of author Shawn Levy is of the tabloid variety with little to back his ever-present purported subjective hypothesis and lame attempts at humor.  A straightforward biography with fleshed-out facts would have been far more appreciated by this reader than the filler that comprised most of the book 
 Full of general information and totally lacking in specifics, this overpriced book (100 pages, $50.00) is something for the contractor looking to sell clients on acid-stained concrete floors and their possibilities. Anyone looking for information about actually doing these floors will have to look elsewhere, probably by taking overpriced training from Mr. Harris' company 
 Clearly not the best from this author. The story starts well but does not fulfill its promises. I had a hard time reading it through the end 
 Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude.  On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.  I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics?   90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose.   Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.  At least get it straight before mixing it up. Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK.  "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer)  Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion.  Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra.  Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep." (both in books and on video) 
   This title is not up to the high standards set by McLachlan's other books. The text does not get into details which are thoroughly discussed in McLachlan's excellent "The EM Algorithm and Extensions." Some important points are so condensed and in places so poorly presented that the the discussion is worthless. For example the important section 3.4 "Standard Errors", which underlies much of the discussion contains errors.    The book could be useful to a practioner who is only looking for guidance in fitting mixture models with available software.  Unfortanately McLachlan's mixture software referred to in the Appendix, is not available. That's a pity because the advertised software features and design potentially rank it the top choice.   For a user who will use his own EM software to fit mixture models I would recommend highly the McLachlan's EM Algorithm book  over the Mixture book. 
 This is a moral relativist/post-modern/revisionist and (therefore necessarily) stridently anti-Christian tome. So undoubtably, some of you will enjoy it.  Ms. Lepore wrote this book primarily to add her singular invective onto the mountain of slanderous and false accusations already accumulated about the people who settled and built this country. (And I thought post-modernist were supposed to be nonjudgmental?)  A sample of the revisionist history Ms. Lepore regales us with is her assertion that torture (of the most hideous and unspeakable nature, well described in this book), practiced by the Indians against English settlers in King Phillips War, was really just as an expression of cultural norms in the Indian "community" and therefore not "wrong" in any absolute sense. Nevertheless Ms. Lepore is in high dudgeon when she describes one occasion when white settlers set fire to an Indian village and slaughtered women and children fleeing the flames.   Actually, the main value I obtained from this book was seeing in "vivid color", so-to-speak, just how bloody the Indian warfare really was. I'm no advocate of massacre, or genocide, but when you read this book it doesn't take a lot of imagination to figure out why "the white man" became so determined to exterminate the Indian. If one day you find yourself enjoying a pipe by the family hearth, with your family all around, and the next you find your home and barn burned to the ground, as well as the raped and mutilated remains of your loved ones scattered about the countryside, I think you might "evolve" some passionate feelings too.  
 Despite reading bad reviews, I took a chance and purchased this item.  I got the first one, hooked it up and it quit working within two hours.  Ordered a second, it quits working within the hour.  I should have known better as others have posted the same experience.  Great concept, maybe they will get the actual product correct in the next year.  Please don't waste your time on this one now.... 
 The first unit was installed as directed and when it was working it was fine. The problem was it would just stop working and this was most of the time. I exchaned several e-mails with customer service rep Pat. She was extremely nice and suggested I send it back for a replacement.  The second unit was installed as directed and worked flawlessly for a couple of months. It now works a bit better than the first one. Instead of stops working most of the time, this one stops working some of the time. I have decided to keep this one because of the bother and expense of shipping it back for a replacement. And who knows, the next unit may not work at all.  Not a good product for Amazon to be selling.   R Lockwoo 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 I hate to say it, but this is a gathering of dumb old saying, many of which I still find no humor in. Save your money, or buy any other book for readers over the age of 6. (Sorry, but I was really disappointed 
 I just didn't enjoy this book. I don't mind so much that a book isn't plot driven if the language is beautiful and the ideas stimulating. With this book, however, I didn't even find the language poetic or evocative. And the ideas were so repetitive and expressed so turgidly that I stopped reading half-way through. I really thought this book could do with a whole lot of editing. It was unsubtle, self-indulgent and dull. Perhaps something got lost in the translation? So disappointed. I had been eager to read this book for ages and when it was finally available at the library I was very excited. Oh well 
 The vast majority of the book has no relation to the title.  There are great passages, but they are largely buried under dozens of pages of yammering prelude, silly bickering, and attempts at drunken humor.  James Morrow's Blameless in Abaddon covers the same theme with much greater depth and breadth 
 After really enjoying the Amici Forever album, I went shopping for another Amici album and found this one.  There really is no comparison between the two.  I've tried listening to it several times to see if I'm missing something, but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the Lawrence Welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe. I was very disappointed 
 Don't buy these. They don't work at all. Even just a few feet away, all you'll hear is static and not even a hint of the other person's voice. I purchased a pair at a brick-and-mortar store, and returned them 
 I was very disappointed with this second edition. My daughter and I loved the first action filled movie and had hoped this would be just as exciting.  The movie dragged out for the first half, and just got worse during the second half.  I continually kept looking at the clock, wondering when it would be over.  We only watched it once, and it will go in the rummage sale later this year 
 I bought the cassette of this when I was in high school.  To be honest it only took a couple of listens to see that it was all one long song with different words put in at intervals.  I was a big Barry Manilow fan before this album.  Give me "Mandy" or "Read 'Em and Weep" anyday over this stuff.  
 This was a really great story told in a really cool way but with this last book it almost all gose down hill. What was mistrious is now sappy a qultia. This is the down fall of the a great story 
 The Sluggers Club is an okay book, but I think it is pretty boring. It has an exciting beginning and ending though. Most baseball finds would enjoy it 
 This book was recomended to me by a naturopath. It was easy enough to read in just one evening. The sections about how bones grow and what your risk factors are for getting osteoporosis were quite good. There is also good advice about what vitamins and minerals in addition to calcium to include in your diet, as well as the importance of vitamin D and sunshine, for calcium absorbtion. However, the food section is confusing. Nelson does not mention sea vegetables as the best food source of calcium and minerals to include in a healthy diet. And since she has the opinion that a person can get all the calcium they need from food sources, she should have included a more accurate calcium food chart in her book. For example, spinach, which tops the vegetable calcium secton, contains a lot of oxalic acid which interfers with calcium absorbtion. Nelson mentions the oxalic acid problem with some foods, but never mentions exactly which foods contain the highest amounts. Instead she says we should eat these foods for other reasons. So, why is spinach at the top of the calcium chart? Let's have a more accurate chart before telling people they can just add up what they are taking in with the chart she provides. Also, in her section on exercises she encourages women over 50 to jump vertically to retain calcium. A woman should gradually build up to 2 full minutes of jumping. What if a persons knees are not in alignment? Jumping is one of the most jarring and hardest things a person can do to their knee joints, especially if they are heavy on their feet. A woman who is over 50 and not used to exercising could easily get injured with this jumping program. I am over 50, and I already exercise 5 or 6 days a week, doing aerobics, running and weight training. I tried jumping vertically at a fitness center in front of a mirror to make sure I did it correctly. Then I went on to do a leg press, which I do on a regular basis, and my left knee hurt. My personal trainer said running would be much better for me than jumping. I do not have joint problems, yet, but I could after Neilson's exercise program. Also, the medication section encourages every woman to consider hormone replacement therapy. Does we all really need this therapy? I am discouraged that this book was rated so highly and recomended. It was mostly a waste of money. Only the first couple sections in the book were really worth reading. Check it out at the library or buy it used if you must 
 I chose these bags partly because of the reviews that I read on this website and because they made economic sense.  I gave birth to a premature infant who was unable to breastfeed.  I have pumped everyday btwn 6-8 times a day since she was born and was blessed to have an ample milk supply.  However, when thawing these bags out I found that I was losing sometimes 4 and 5 bags of at a time due to leakage not from the double seal at the top, but from a seam at the bottom.  I later tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes, these bags are better than their competitors, but they were not good enough for me. I have worked way too hard to provide my child with nourishment only to have it leak all over the place.  My solution was to use bottles.  They too have disadvantages (take up more room in the freezer), but I feel that they are a better choice 
 This is a black & white edition: it does NOT include the color plates of older editions.  Without color, it is impossible to appreciate the formulations of the thought-forms.  Buy an older edition instead 
 Old Jules is not a bad book, it's just too long for one thing.  The characters and their lifestyle are quite unique but their lackluster day to day existence needn't have taken up so many pages.  If you want gripping, white-knuckle excitement, look elsewhere.  The book is interesting from a historical point of view maybe but it just wasn't my kind of read.  (Ho-hum........ 
 I was required to buy this book when I took a course taught by the author, Jeff Perloff.  This book is the absolute worst micro text I've ever come across.  It's confusing and unorganized much like the author himself.  If you're looking for a good intro micro text, I suggest you look elsewhere.  I highly recommend Nicholson's Microeconomic Theory 
 This book doesnt help, its just keywords and blank papers. I wouldn't buy it again 
 Elle used to be a great fashion magazine, but no longer. Ofcourse, there are too many adds (but then, that's what pays for the mag). I just wish that Elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles (the hard hitting type) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical. I buy Elle for "the fashion/beauty advice" NOT to read some pseudo intellectual writer's hard hitting political agenda. For hard hitting news items I read the Wall Street Journal, Atlantic Monthly, and watch Fox News.  
 Do not buy this product. The one I got was used three times and it quit. 
 I'm not a new-age fan by any means. But when I saw this CD and the personnel who were on it, I expected some sort of light pop-jazz. Instead it made elevator music more appealing. The strings are just overbearing on  this record. The great Herb Alpert is relegated to a background sound. What  a shame! I'm sure this appeals to the wine-and-cheese crowd, but for me  this will cure insomnia in a heartbeat 
 After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions, we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed, as some people do).  My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine.  However, we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently.  What a nightmare to collapse!  Again, the directions are of absolutely no help.  It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up.  Also, this thing weighs a ton.  I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling.  How annoying.  Bottom line:  if you're going to set this up and never take it down, it's fine (once you initially get it put together, that is).  However,  if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home,  forget it!  
 I did not receive the book I ordered.  The tracking process indicated that it had been sent to Atlanta to the Lost package dept.  There was no name to deliver to and no place to return.  I was disappointed not to receive a book I paid for 
 If you are looking for a textbook you can use to learn statistical methods, this is not the one. The book is most useful for scientists experienced in applying the methods of statistics, who want to sharpen their mathematical apparatus to put their research on a firm foundation. The level of mathematical knowledge required to read the book is not very high but quite demanding as in many cases lots of intermediary calculations are left to the reader, so to properly read the book you have to have a pen and paper to follow the derivation of formulae 
 What kind of masterpiece is this supposed to be?  Psuedo-Dickensonian language that drags you down like old mud. The "colorful" characters are all steriotypes: pure good or pure evil, (or pure dumb in the case of the hero), drawn from some 19th century grab bag.  And the plot ... god I hate plots that rely upon the endless stupidity of their protaganist to drive them onward.  The plot ... nothing happens except in responce to some idiotic action by the main character. If the man, (well kid ... I admit that I could not stick it out enough pages for the little brat to grow up) had the sense and self preservation instinct of an intelligent spaniel there would be no story 
 A book about accounting written by a nonaccountant.  A waste of your time and money.  My copy went into the trash 
 Bramley is just as bad as sitchen with his outlandish interpretations.  Sure, there is a conspiracy of sorts but Bramley's theories doesnt hit the mark.  The whole talk of antiquity interpretation was laughable at best.  The only conspirators on planet earth is the western governments!  This book, and others like it shows that ppl like myself and others have too much time to be occupied with nonsense.  Besides conspiracy or not just go for a personal goal no one with conspire against that. 
 If this album is overlooked its only because none of the songs here are memorable.  I did like "I'd Rather Ride Around With You" but its too reminiscent of teeny boppers joy riding.  The ballads are not very memorable.  THey don't stand out!!  Everything is too loud.  Does anyone even remember when Reba USED to be Country instead of POP 
 Before taking a 4 hour train trip, I surveyed the pulp novels available at the news-stand.  I didn't want to make the mistake of picking up another book I would have to throw away in disgust 3 days later, like "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" or anything by that man-hating forensic anthropologist, what's-her-name.  So I went with "Bourne Ultimatum" as a safe bet, figuring, since I had seen "Identity" and "Supremacy" in the movie incarnations, and they were pretty good, this would be more of the same.    I was very wrong.  From the first few chapters, it became clear that the book was incoherent, repetitive, and its characters were laughably underdeveloped.  Later, huge holes in the plot began to appear, apparent lapses in reason and knowledge on the part of the author regarding their own material.  These seem to haunt many pulp novels, but nowhere is it more annoying.  Also, the author has the lazy habit of putting a lot of dialogue in italics to show emotion, rather than writing emotional dialogue.    This book has become almost unreadable, so it's going to the curb tomorrow.  I'm quitting on page 263.  I don't like or feel attached to any of the characters, and the plot has become a confusing spiral of contrivances.  I agree with the other reviewers who have stated that this book is a real slog to read; the opposite of a page-turner.  It's sad to see a trilogy that apparently started well, end like this.  You can guess from reading it that Ludlum, if he even wrote it, had no interest in the material, but had a contract to fulfill.              
      David Sklansky is a very well known mathematically oriented poker player.  He has written such icons as The Theory of Poker, Tournament Poker for Advanced Players, and 7 Card Stud for Advanced Players.  He also wrote Hold 'em Poker and co-authored the sequel with Mason Malmuth.  These books have laid the foundation for how many players play these forms of poker.  Ed Miller wrote the book Small Stakes Hold 'em, which again is an gem.  However, most all of their previous work has dealt with fixed betting limits and expectation formulae. No Limit Hold 'em is as beautiful and complex a game as can be found nowadays.  No surprise that given its popularity the masses are hungry for a comprehensive book dealing explicitly with the subject.  Doyle Brunson's priceless section in Super Systems has for a long time quenched this desire, but as of late people seem to be craving more.  So what better way to satisfy this need than to crank out a book with one of the most popular authors with one of the biggest authorities on poker (two plus two) to publish it?      Admittedly, the authors give a "disclaimer" in the introduction about how they were skeptical about writing a book solely dealing with the subject because of the complexity.  So it's no surprise they forwarn the audience that the book will take a mathematical approach to its situations.  It is full of examples filled with percentages and the mathematical rigor we've come to expect from a book written by Sklansky.      However, it is possible to get too carried away with the mathematics, as the rigor not only seems to draw some very strange conclusions, but sometimes it flat out contradicts what Sklansky advises in some of his other books.  (For example, in Tournament Poker for Advanced Players, he advises folding a small favorite hand on the bubble to avoid taking unnecessary gambles, but here he says sometimes you should make calls as an underdog in the same situation).      Another problem is how the mathematically derived advice seems to completely circumvent the fact that the game is No Limit Texas Hold 'em in the first place.  The section on the Sklansky-Chubukov rankings gives interesting information, but is not very useful because not only are there many ways to play AK other than moving all-in or folding preflop, but also assumes your opponent is a computer who knows your hand and plays perfectly every time.  I don't know about anybody else, but I can't remember the last time I sat at a table with one of those.      It frequently takes best and worst case scenarios and sets them as the standard for the advice they give.  For example, they advise that buying into a game short stacked is a very good strategy, because it will often force your opponent to play incorrectly against you in multiway pots.  The reason is because, as they assume, you are in the best case scenario: in the pot with close to the nuts, and your opponents are big dogs hoping to get lucky on somebody else with a bigger stack who's also in the hand.      This kind of approach is understandable, since pure mathematics leaves little room for human creativity.  But in a game where creativity is more important than the cards that are dealt, there is ultimately little use of it. 
 I'm writing this for my seven year old grandaughter --she loves this DVD- she twirls and bounces and dances all the way thru it -- it transports her to an imaginary stage where she is the star-- I love watching her enjoy this dvd!! 
 The others summed it up.  Cheap parts, difficult to adjust. Put your money towards the EZ Rip instead. Costs more but much better results 
 As one who had great success with the Atkins diet, I would say without reservation that such success is possible if one follows the programme exactly as it is outlined in the original New Diet Revolution, to which I'd give six stars if I could. The Induction period (first two weeks) is explained in depth in that book, and there is no need for a separate book to advertise products. In fact, the products are not only unnecessary (or no longer manufactured), but could sabotage the Induction period 
 This account of European royalty between the 17th-20th centuries has some interesting stories about the eccentric and often deplorable behaviour of the members of various royal families.  There is an emphasis on sexual misbehaviour, and Mr. Shaw's own prejudices show up quite clearly.  He obviously has a strong distaste for the idea of women having sex past a certain age, Catherine the Great comes in for particular censor for being still interested in sex while in her sixties (ugh!)He refers  sneeringly to George I's mother as a "flabby, toothless crone"She was a very old lady at the time, but that's no excuse, evidently, for being flabby and toothless.  I suppose Mr Shaw thinks she should have been working out at the gym, or something. Camilla Parker-Bowles is refered to dissaprovingly as 'Prince Charles's forty-five year old mistress' (one feels Mr Shaw would dissaprove of her less had she been in her twenties).Mr Shaw seems to feel that hereditary power, combined with in-breeding, is the cause of the bad behaviour of monarchs, though as a previous reviewer pointed out, that hardly explains the deplorable behaviour of such non-hereditary monarchs as Napoleon, Hiter, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao etc.  An intersting book if you don't mind the constant dwelling on (sometimes wildly exaggerated) disgusting details.  The blurb on the back of the book describes this volume as 'side-splitting' but it is hardly that.  Midly amusing perhaps.  If you want a side-splitting history book, try 'The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody' by Will Cuppy 
 it should be stateed this item is for 7 years and younger very small for older kid 
 I think there is some high quality writing on this disc and I find 3-4 of the songs to be quite listenable. However, that's the highest compliment I can muster. With the exception of "Now Comes The Night," only b/c I burned it onto a compilation, I haven't listened to this cd since the month it came out. I wasn't looking for a Justin Timberlake-esque album when I picked this up. I just don't dig whatever direction Rob wanted to go in with his solo material. I find the stylistic inconsistency as a hinderance to the album rather than a selling point for his diversity. Next effort please 
 Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book.  Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility.  The title says "interpreting" so I will allow him creative license. Expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in Stalin's treatise on the U.S. Constitution 
 Dont get me wrong, if i would speak German i would love this book but even starting with the title it is hard to understand. What does monographien und texte zur mean anyways. I've read books before in languages i don't  understand and loved them. O yeah and where is Nietzsches 
 The book does give Hamiltons WSJ columns, which are of historical interest, but does not provide a useful method of applying the theory.  Much better material on the Dow Theory are available on the internet 
 From the first line of her first chapter, the author seems to resent being a mother.  I found it hard to sympathize with her plight:  she considered herself an artist, but then got pregnant by accident, and now is stuck being a mother.  To console herself, she writes this longwinded and often tedious account of all the minutia she endures on a daily basis with two children in her charge.  I feel for her kids who will one day read this and wonder why their mother was so ambivalent about taking care of them 
 Before reviewing the latest Paul Auster novel, I'd like to point out a few things: I am a huge Auster fan. First, I saw Smoke, the movie, and even though I hate cigarretes, I found it simply beautiful. After that, I read The New York Trilogy and The music of chance. It's hard to  describe these novels. While reading them, I felt like they were burning my hands, but I couldn't stop reading them. Late at night, when I could barely see, I kept telling to myself, one more chapter, another chapter, just a few more pages. Then I realized that the end was close, so finished them in less then two days. The music of chance was so hypnotic, that even if I had to walk some where, I would read while I was walking. That's the spell that these two novels pulled on me.   Now, I few years later, I went full circle. I read every single novel Auster wrote, so you can consider me a PaulAusterologist. Although I read a lot, Auster is the only author, prolific author (more than 7 novels) of which I read his whole work (novels) What did I found in this journey? He is very reiterative, very very. Most of his characters are some how in the writing business, if not writers. As he is. They went to Columbia. As he did. They speak french. As he does. They are avid readers. As he is. Of course that this happens with many writers, but this is maybe too much. Also, you always find the idea that little events, little decisions we make, can reshape our life in a blink. Last but not least, his characters are always commited to major tasks. Things that only they understand, but some how will be very important. Things that for unknown reasons, they must do. This is Paul Auster's world. And he is running out of ideas.  What about Travels in the scriptorium? Well, basically Auster is being visited by his characters. They are angry, yet they care for him. The question is, after he did so many things to them, sent them to so many dangerous places, made them do so many twisted things, what do they feel about him, what would they do to him if they have a chance? That's a question many writers ask themselves, but turning it in to a novel? I don't know... looks lazy to me, specially after producing so many similar pieces lately.  Finally, Auster is human as we are. That means that he is obsessed and haunted by certain questions just as we are. These questions will be after us our whole life, yes, but if you are a writer, you must try to write something new and not the same novel over and over.   A few years ago, I saw a García Márquez interview. He said that after One hundred years of solitude, that kind of writing, the themes, the structure, the universe and the type of characters, were so deep in him, that he could have written the same book, slightly changed, over and over for many years. But he didn't. Instead, he stopped writing. He took a break. He took many years. And then, only then, when he finally got rid of the One hundred years of solitude universe, he produced a different book, completely fresh. I think that Auster should do the same 
 Unfortunately you shipped me a Region 1 version when I am clearly in UK, Region2. you then shipped a FOC replacement, again Region1 you then offered me a refund if I paid to ship them back to you, as I have not been able to view either copy and cannot give you a better "review"  
 This film has been re-released as "Meltdown."  There are a few reasons for watching this movie: 1) Jet Li.  2) Chingmy Yau (the reporter).  3) Wu Ma (Frankie's dad)  4) a decent fight scene at the end.  Jacky Cheung is also not as aggravating as usual.   That's it.  Jet Li has appeared in three or four films directed by Wong Jing, and, just as Chow Yun Fat does in God of Gamblers and Jackie Chan does in City Hunter, he does what he can.  The direction of the film, however (as well as GOG and CH), stinks.  The plot copies Die Hard and Speed, with some broad satire aimed at Jackie Chan, but that is not the problem.  Put simply, Jackie Chan knows how to direct a film.  Wong Jing does not.  If you want to see Jet Li, go see Fist of Legend, Once Upon A Time in China, or just about anything else he has done.  If you want to see a good Hong Kong action movie, watch films directed by John Woo, Ringo Lam, Tsui Hark, Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung.  Jet Li is fun to watch, but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this 
 The publishers of this CD are being blatantly DISHONEST. The CD claims to be the AUDIO Unlimited Power and even includes a statement about it being narrated by Anthony Robbins.   Yet the CD is NOT AN AUDIO VERSION OF THE BOOK. It is simply a recording of Mr Robbins presenting 50 minutes of material at a seminar.   Only in small letters at the back of the CD does it say "abridged version".   Avoid the CD. Just buy and read the book. 
 With great expectation I looked forward to getting Mr. Shaffer's book, especially after reading a great review of it in the now defunct section of the LA Times called Outdoors...once in my possession, I would be among the cognoscenti of southern California's natural wonders...but alas it is not to be...First, I looked for the 80' three tiered Fish Canyon falls just above Duarte in the San Gabriel's...nothing was to be found...this is one of the most famous and beautiful falls in all of the San Gabriel's...a simple call to any, and I mean ANY ranger the area could have named it...no, nothing...Next, I looked for the well known but unnamed falls just off the Middle fork of Lytle Creek, three actually that include drops between 60' and 80' respectively...again nothing, not one word...both of these spectacular and beautiful falls can be seen in all their grandeur on the NET and at numerous sites...Definitive, hardly...two stars and only because of its beautiful layout...  
 This movie was just about the worst movie I ever saw... so utterly and painfully pointless, and not the slightest bit funny. Tom Green makes a complete fool of himeself. I actually turned off the movie half-way through because it was so stupid... Don't waste your time or money on this one! 
 This book never came together for me.  Right up to the end I was waiting and waiting for everything to come into focus, but it never did.  I never really saw the point the author was trying to make and thus it was a lot of semi-interesting stuff that happened.  The story is about Jack and Connor Reed, whose parents are both dead.  When the story begins, Connor is 17 and being raised by Jack, a junior member of his father's old law firm in Cleveland.  The book then covers the next 23 years of their lives as they marry and divorce and have kids and so forth.  Connor gets Hodgkin's disease but survives while Jack moves to Chicago to reconcile and marry (then divorce, then possibly remarry) his long-time fiancee Mona.  Jack reluctantly has one son with Mona while Connor knocks up his girlfriend Laine and marries her and then divorces her, then possibly will remarry her.  A lot of the story--not just when Connor gets Hodgkin's--has the characters getting sick.  Connor has a migraine.  Laine cuts her hand.  Mona gets mugged and hurts her wrist.  Jack and Connor get food-poisoned on a trip from Cleveland to Massachusetts.  Later Jack gets food-poisoned with his new girlfriend Kathy.  Even Connor's dog gets sick!  The first few times this is fine, but after a while it's repetitive.  Then of course we have Jack and Mona who break up and get together more than Ross and Rachel on "Friends."  This gave the story a soapy edge I doubt the author intended, although she's worked for the National Enquirer, so maybe that's exactly what she meant to do.  Do people really keep breaking up and getting together anywhere other than TV?  And of course Connor and Laine have the same problem to a lesser extent.  Maybe the author wanted us to believe in the bond of family or love or whatever, but as a good 50% of the population (or more) can tell you, most people who break up do not get back together--then break up, then get together, ad nauseum.  But I think the most annoying part of the book is that because it covers 23 years in 260 pages, it's always leaping around.  At the start of every chapter is that disorienting moment when as the reader you're trying to determine when this is taking place, how much time has passed, and what's changed between chapters.  So really you're spending a good quarter of the time reading wondering what the heck is going on.  Not good.  Writing-wise, I'm never a big fan of present tense.  There also seemed like a few grammatical errors and spelling errors the editor did not catch.  There was also at least one factual error as well.  The 1988 movie with Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman is "Rain Man" not "Rainman"--a simple check on IMDB could have caught that.  Such trivial errors may seem unimportant, but it erodes my confidence in the author.  Not to mention it's just plain sloppy.  Overall I breezed through this book and it wasn't completely awful, but there are a lot of better books out there.  Still, this is probably a good lightweight read for the plane or beach.  That is all 
 The problem with this book is that it seems to be the "default" book for the subject...which it should not be. It contains an in-depth and exhaustive look at all the nooks and crannies of the AppleScript language itself; but almost nothing about how it is actually applied (i.e., how to control other applications).   If you are looking for a "how do I use AppleScript to do stuff on my Mac" book, look elsewhere. If you are a programmer and looking for advanced details on AppleScript, this may be the book for you 
 I went through this cookbook after going through the new Southern Living Slow Cooker Cookbook and what a disappointment! Not only does this book use many pre-packaged items (if I'm making it myself, I'd rather not use that junk), the recipes were dull. Almost every recipe was in the other cookbook and was MUCH better. I also purchased the More Betty Crocker Slow Cooker Recipes and MANY of the recipes were the same--picture and all! What a waste of money. Purchase the new Southern Living Slow Cooker cookbook and you'll be MUCH happier 
 This is 5th edition of the book written in early 90th (first edition was in 1994). The book did not change much since. This is fuzzy, politically correct and watered down presentation of the subject. For example when you learn about cognitive dissonance you are not told that the original Festinger experiment was connected with the behavior of a flood doomsday cult after the target date of the flood passed.    This might be an OK book as a second of third book for self-education (you can save money buying any previous edition, but in no way this should be your first or only book on the subject), but this can be a horror show if this is your standard textbook at the university 101 Social physiology course and you need to pass an exam.  Here the inability of the authors to distinguish between important and unimportant will hunt you down.   The authors are too fond of  abusing "social-psychology-speak" and introduce too many pseudo-scientific terms without real necessity: it looks like they try artificially inflate both themselves and the subject by immersing trivial notions in obscure jargon. This infatuation with jargon, on the level completely unacceptable for the introductory course is one of the worst features of the book. It especially evident are summaries which are the Achilles spot of the book: badly written, badly thought-out, somewhat detached from the chapters content, horribly structured and weakly typeset.   The other problem with this book as an introductory (101 type) book is that it is just too big. Story-telling approach that authors use is not bad per se, but inability of authors to distinguish between really important and entertaining psycho-trivia distracts the reader. Their recently introduced multi-cultural approach adds to political correctness, but also adds to the volume.   If you are a student it is very difficult textbook to learn from. It provides an ample opportunity for a professor to create a test consisting of dozens of  hair-splitting terminology abusing questions.  You can never be sure that the detail you missed is really unimportant. You need to memorize all definitions and most of the experiments mentioned it the chapter (you might benefit from creating a Rolodeck of experiments mentioned in the book) and using the website tests to prepare. Please note that sample tests provided on website can be perfect for killing any further interest in social psychology in probably 80% of students :-)   I would like to reiterate it again that the main weakness of the book is the author inability to distinguish between really important material and trivial or supplementary material as well as almost complete absence of connections between chapters. Actually chapters can be read in a random order. There are many descriptions of both good and petty/questionable experiments without authors distinguishing between a few critical, ground-braking experiments and regular mass of  pseudo-psychological junk experiments.   Absence of CD with summaries and self-tests in inexcusable for a book with such a price, but the website is not bad (if you can find it ;-)   Typesetting of the book is weak and reflects authors complete absence of attention to structuring the material in a way that helps learners. The good thing is that definitions are put on the margins; the bad thing is that is some chapters (for example Ch 5) there just  too many definitions. Typesetting of summaries is just horrible: huge solid blocks of text with few bold typeface word/sentences.   Although I am not a professional in the field, my impression is that for self-study there are better books, both more interesting and better organized. From a few that I browsed John Sabini's textbook looks like a better deal: more interesting contents with higher dose of relevant to student's life staff. Douglas T. Kenrick textbook contains CD and looks better structured.  
 Just bought this thing...filled it up once - worked great - had to fill it up again and it's so awkward to hold - it slipped and cracked completely.  Called to order a replacement tank and they don't even have any!!!!  So, basically I threw all my money out the window!  Very upset.  They said to call back in two weeks to try to order the part 
 Prospective readers should be aware that this book promotes the long-discredited psychoanalytic view of autism as an emotional disturbance. Full of bizarre interpretations which have remarkably little to do with the subjective experience of autism as described in first-person accounts such as those by Temple Grandin. Interesting enough in its way, but nothing to do with autism 
 My mother recently ordered this book by Mr. Chopra and was urging me to read it. She spoke very highly of it and told me that he used science to prove God and such, etc. Allow me to be upfront. I am a skeptic, and a firm Atheist. I do not believe in the backward illogical concept of God that most religion would scare you to believe in. But I decided to keep an open mind, as I always do, and I read Mr. Chopra's "How To Know God" from cover to cover.   First of all, Mr. Chopra does not speak of the God that most religions speak of. He in fact urges the reader to rethink their concept of God, the first chapter is called "A Real and Useful God". Here Mr. Chopra describes a God that all of us can reach directly, and he also describes most people's general view of God and how he is a supposedly unattainable God until death...etc. He then devises 7 Stages of God, that match our human emotions and says there is a God for each stage. He continues to say that whenever we feel this or that, we are experiencing the God of that stage. This is where I begin to have a problem.   Mr. Chopra begins this book with his own concept of God, that is neither supported by scientific evidence or any sort of rational thought at all. I was unable to get anything out of the following pages because I could not help wondering why I was not given any evidence into Mr. Chopra's thought process. He simply creates his own idea and flies with it, assuming the reader will just go along with it and not apply any sort of thought. This is weak and misleading. But I continued to read. He then begins to talk about three versions of reality, the material reality (the material world), virtual reality, and quantum reality (God's world outside of space-time). He then says that there are many arguments in the material world against God, but none of these can be applied because God is not in the material reality, he is in the Quantum reality. Absolute garbage! Pure assumption! I was outraged by this statement, and saw it as a poor way of denying the logical and rational arguments against God. Mr. Chopra once again maintains excellent continuity by not supporting his claims with any sort of scientific evidence. How can he say that God is in a different reality? What makes him think God isn't in the same reality that we are in? How does he know there is a virtual reality? These so-called "realities" seem very fabricated to me. They are a clever way of escaping arguments against God, if you put God outside of this world then you can't apply any arguments from our reality to his, according to Chopra. I do not buy this, and feel sorry for anyone who does. I am impressed though. That is a clever trick, and nothing more than a trick. Mr. Chopra seems to be exhibiting "wishful thinking" here. He acknowledges that the mind is in search of God and needs God (with scientifc evidence), I believe Chopra's mind is just like all other minds and wants to justify God and find God, so he will by all means attempt to do that. He wishes for there to be a God, and so there will be. He can change his reality as he pleases. This sort of wishful thinking is dangerous when explaning or proving a point because it makes Mr. Chopra incredibly biased and unreliable.   While reading this book in its early pages I was almost assured that Mr. Chopra was speaking of God in a purely metaphorical sense, but I later found (much to my disappointment) that he was speaking of God in a very real and literal sense. Many will claim that Chopra uses "science" and "quantum physics" to explain God and how we can reach him, but that is a misconception and perversion of the truth. Mr. Chopra does indeed make clever points using theories and stories involving quantum physics, but they do not relate directly to the existence of God, or our ability to reach him. They seem to just be random tidbits Chopra throws in so he can say he proved God and our ability to reach him with "science." It is an absolute mockery.   I did find Mr. Chopra's ending chapters on the paranormal (telepathy, esp, clairvoyance, synchronicity) to be interesting, but once again not supported by anything and pure wishful thinking. Mr. Chopra just plays the God card everytime he is faced with a dilemma that is unexplainable or difficult to understand. The God card in this case is more like a Joker, it serves no purpose and is just a laugh.   Mr. Chopra does have good stories to tell, but they serve no relevance to God or finding him. His writing is not bad, but it is also not very good. I find Mr. Chopra to be a very weak thinker who ignores all rational arguments and ways of logic and reason to further exonerate his wishful thinking and enforce the idea of God in his reality. If you are interesting in a book relating Science and Spirituality I would recommend Amit Goswami's "The Self-Aware Universe". I do not recommend this book at all, especially to other skeptics. Mr. Chopra not only seems to have a rather negative and close minded view of skeptics but he completely shuts them out and addresses them in a rude manner.  I have kept an open mind in reading this book, but Mr. Chopra has not, in fact he hasn't shown much evidence of an intelligent "mind" at all.   This book receives two stars just for effort and a few interesting tidbits. 
 I had this review under a different CD (The Best of Final Fantasy 1994-1999), but it was also under a different user-name (actually, same user-name, but it had quote marks around it, somehow making it a different account.  That's all irrelevant to this CD, though)  This CD isn't exactly the worst out there, but it has some points where it comes pretty close. Track one is good once you get used to it. At first it sounds sucky, but it gets better. The second one is about the same as the second half of the first one but is done with different instruments. The third one is absolutely horrible! Skip it at all costs! The Prelude could be better, mostly longer and with the crystal-like sound of FFVII and FFIV instead of the cheap piano keyboard. The opening theme could be done much better. Preferably like it was done in FF Generation S. There is absolutely no life in this track, whereas if you listen to Final Fantasy S Generations, you can definitely tell the difference.  To list just a couple of reasons: there's about two minutes more music on S Generations than on this CD, and the music is orchestrated making it feel more alive.  Cosmo Canyon was done pretty well, if not a little fast for the original pace. If they had slowed the tempo down a bit it would've been perfect. I personally didn't have any problems with the Shinra March, and it does have a catchy tune. The eighth one was incredibly ridiculous!!! Once again I refer to the FF Generation S. That was done 1000 percent better and didn't use cheap electronic synth vocals. The vocals aren't even understandable. The ninth track is pretty much the same as the second one of FF Generation S. The rest of the tracks I pretty much skip because they aren't worth the time and aren't done very well. The choice of instruments is extremely cheap and the sound is unpleasent. In reality, I recommend FF Generation S over this one, but this one is good to listen to from time to time just as long as you are willing to deal with some of the garbage.      All in all---This CD is a joke.  The music itself is just under average, but if you listen to it enough you might start to like it.  I go back occasionally to listen to a few tracks, but it's rare. You're $20 bucks, or however much you want to waste on it, can be spent in better places so definitely skip 
 While it's not quite as horrid as the film of the same name, the WHO'S THAT GIRL? soundtrack is still a rather wretched affair.  Due to Madonna's incredible popularity, this disc managed to hit the Hot 200's Top Ten and reach Platinum status in sales, but it's far from a must-own now.  Madonna contributes four tracks, and they all sound like TRUE BLUE out-takes.   Madonna wrote the big hit "Who's That Girl?" (#1 Pop, #5 Adult Contemporary, #44 Dance) with Patrick Leonard, and it's a virtual rewrite of their own superior "La Isla Bonita."  The wistful ballad "The Look of Love" (also co-written with Leonard) is less derivative, but much more ordinary.  The frantic, Steve Bray-produced dance track "Causing A Commotion" (#2 Pop, #1 Dance) fares much better, and is an undervalued gem in Madonna's singles catalogue.    The only other Madonna cut (the generic "Can't Stop," also produced and co-written by Bray) is an obvious throwaway, yet it is still better than any of the other non-Madonna tracks.  The remaining cuts are by other "artists" (I use that term loosely) and are anonymous and unlistenable.  There's a reason why Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi never went anywhere. 
 All I knew about MFK Fisher before reading this book was that she was a food writer.   This collection of essays portrays a self-absorbed, self-obsessed and self-indulgent silly woman of questionable character.  Since she is long-winded  and reveals sexual values likely considered loose during her time, it is only natural that she has been elevated to the faux status of fine American writer.   (I'm sure feminists love the fact that she walked out on her first husband, near as I can tell to avoid serving marshmallow salads to faculty wives, whom she apparently despised as beneath her intellectual superiority.)   I finished the book only because my contempt for the author kept me plodding through her essays.   This vain barfly thought she possessed divine insight, but I think it more likely that her insobriety prompted an abnormal amount of self-examination and reflection.   Her sentimental gushings reveal an egotistical, pompous, pretentious, shallow, and frivolous woman.   What astonished me is that she yammered on about suppers in France endlessly, but made only a passing reference to her second husband losing a leg and then his other three limbs prior to his death.   One would think this amount of tragedy and human suffering should command more discussion than a very good bowl of soup.  After reading the book, I read some bios of MFK Fisher's life, one of which mentioned her psychotherapist.  My insight into her personality proved accurate.   I'll think of her when I nuke TV dinners.  Celebrating life is not the same as celebrating oneself.   
 Great Product but shame on Amazon for selling it without telling people that it is old software.  Kudos to Acronis for giving me a free upgrade to 10.  Acronis 10 is absolutely wonderful 
 I am majorly disappointed with this book. I was really shopping around for Case In Point / Vault Guide to Case Interview, but since those books aren't carried by my local bookstore and I need that quickly, I end up choosing this as it has an electronic version. It's no good. FULL STOP. It's like a random summary of a MBA courses, Porter's five forces etc.. But I don't think this book is helping with dealing with case interview at all, rather it's confusing the candidate especially for those non-MBA students who didn't know about those infamous business framework. It's giving them a incomplete and useful illustrations. Disappointed.. 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 If you're looking for a quick mystery read, then this was the way to go.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  After my book club read "Ain't Nobody's Business" we were eager to try one of Wilson Wesley's mysteries.  However, the group's general consensus was that the book was too short, too predictable, and the storyline was not all that original.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading her mainstream novels, though 
 I bought this seat for $40 on sale at toys-r-us, since it stated it would fit "most" bikes.  I followed the directions that came with the seat, and that made it impossible to install on both bikes that I tried it on.  After several choice words and approximately 2 1/2 hours later per bike (5 hours total), I finally had this piece of crap installed, only to find out that both my and my wife's heels grinded against the footrests of the seat.  DO NOT buy this piece of crap, it is not worth any amount of money as far as i'm concerne 
 I been a bone thugs fan for a while now and I have to say this is not all the best hits. The first cd is very nice and worth its value but the second cd is not good. the only good songs from the second cd is resurrection (paper, paper), thugz cry, and ecstasy. the songs that are real hits are eternal,east 1999, mo murda, no surrender, sleepwalkers, handle the vibe, down 71 (the getaway), 7 sign, and bone,bone,bone. this are some of their real hits. The ones I didn't mention on the second cd are boring and I bet u dont want to hear them. this songs should been put on the second cd. I would give this cd a 5 star but I wont with those songs I dont like 
 I have never written a review of a book before, but after reading this book I felt I had too. What happened to this series. The first two books were great, but this book dosen't even come close to being as good. Somebody should have cut about 300 pages from this book. The first two books in the series I could'nt put down, but this book was very difficult to finish. I dont think I will read the 4th volume in this never ending series 
 This cutting board developed a split only 6 weeks after I got it.  It has had proper care and minimal use.  Don't buy it.  Shipping was timely - no problem there 
 This book is very well illustrated but then it just goes down hill from there.  I didn't find the information it gave very useful and there just wasn't very much content to the book.  This is the first flower arrangement book I've bought and I've only had it a day and I'm looking for a new and better one!  Good Luck 
 I am writing this review moments after finishing this book. THE SURROGATE was a very interesting novel and kept me guessing throughout, which is the type of book I find very entertaining. The problems I had though are with the author's insistant use of profanity and sexual scenes. The profanity was way to graphic and completly useless. It seemed as though she through them in for shock value which  did nothing to help the story. Especially the scene where the lawyer described sex with his wife. What did that accomplish in moving the story forward?! Absolutely positively NOTHING! Also, the sexual scenes between Jamie and Joe weren't needed either. The author successfully painted a picture of a couple very much in love but the sex scenes just made it sound tawdry and immature. "His [...] was amazing". Stupid wording. Let their love have meaning. Let it mean more and leave a lot more to the reader's imagination. We will thank you for it later. 
 Unless you are a first timer to the area this book will tell you very little.  While the information regarding the area (complete with maps) can be helpful the information on new restaurants and hotels is non existant.  (I notice they didn't list many resorts including the well known Palace properties).  This can help you with local things but use some other source for where to stay/eat. I also found the web had more information then this book did.  The only difference I can see with this book was that they added "great websites".  Which really consist of about five very generalized sites.  If you want an overall view it is fine.  If you want detailed info (where to eat, where to stay) I would suggest another publication 
 It reminds me of a cheap imitation patch that my grandmother would sow onto a hat. I have several MLB hats and this isn't anywhere near the same quality 
 I am new to web design but am pretty good with computers.  I have been producing and editing music for fun for years.  This book is dicey at best.  There are good points, but overall it is hard to follow and gives a poor explaination of Dreamweaver's features.  Hopefully, the author is better in the classroom than she is in this text or I feel sorry for her students 
 What a pile of vapid tripe. Reading this book actually lowered my IQ. I quess I could've felt stupider, I could've actually paid for this book. If the overexcessive use of the terms "darling", "amazing", and "delicious" don't give you the douche-chills, then you might actually be able to plod your way through this refuse without wanting to take a hot iron to each of the characters' faces. Anyone who likes this vacuous load of landfill fodder probably thinks that Paris Hilton is a great musician 
 Well I went to the concert and the whole time while I was watching it, I was glade they where coming out with a dvd because DVD can HOLD lots and LOTS AND LOTS of information and why would they cheap out and not put every artist with every song on here why I WOULD BE 100$ I don't care I want to see it all. And well I waited months and months, wondering waiting for it to come out, I went there with 3 other friends and it was the thing of a life time. Then it was time the P%$%# @%#T DVD of the century. THank you EMI for destroying a historial document so you can get all your SIGNED Contracts on to your DVD. Well now all I have to do is use my Time Machine and Get a tape ready and tape the Damn concert. Wait TIme machines doen't exist well now I am going ot have to go underground to get it. But wait I still $100 will EMI Release all the videos on DVD or do we have to go underground to get it from someone who tapped it and is selling it. All I can say this is why the internet was invented for INFORMATION EXCHANGE. If they keep information paticularly this Historical Document from people, they will share it over the internet. The video doesn't belong to 1 Company it belongs to the world, the world created this and WHO does EMI think they are by limiting this. I am so sick and tired of this utter B$%# @#$T. No one should settle for this, I demand more and Everyone should demand more also.3 Billion People watched 1 million spectaters. And what does EMI Tell you, they will put the crappiest DVD together and then make everyone take the videos down of there website. I believe I shall find them all and put them up on Wikipedia because it isn't 1 Person who owns the worlds creation. Anyone who believes in this should know what it means to them Every Extra CEnt of this DVD should go to AFrica and it doesnt it and its a Bloody shame. All I can say Is I am making sure this goes on to Every Review for this damned DVD untill something is done about it.   VIVA LA RISTANCE : D -THE REAL LENBO 
 I guess I am the only reviewer who found this book tedious and banal.  It's more a series of thumbnail biographies of pga tour players, linked together through weekly accounts of pga tour stops, than anything else.  Feinstein's writing seems to move along at a brisk enough pace, but after several chapters, I found one event starting to blend into the next, one Q school qualifier after another, one harrowing tournament finish after another, and so on, and so on.  Feinstein's writing verges on being formulaic- it's all written in a sort of breathless, anxiety filled pace, as the nail biting details of who's missing the cut, who's choking under pressure, whose marriage is on the rocks, who's in danger of returning to Q school all gets mixed together in a swill of golf gossip and insider minutia.  What I found missing in this harried chronicle is any sign of the transcendental joy that marks golf at it's best.  It's almost as if Feinstein writes to show us how miserable and unbearably tense the world of professional golf is.  While some of the details he provides are interesting, overall I found the book repetitive and lacking in the sort of poetry that the best sports writing sometimes achieves 
 This otherwise fine collection is marred by Knight's illustrations of a child playing Indian! In the party scene, children wear hats, including a feathered headband. Now, anyone can CHOOSE to be a pirate, or a sailor, or  one can BECOME a prince or princess. But, one cannot CHOOSE to be a Native  American, nor can they BECOME one simply by putting on a feathered  headband. Teachers and parents interested in social justice can point this  out to children if they choose to buy the book. Consider the parallel: if  you are going to allow children to "be" a Native American, then  it is only fair to allow them to "be" a Jew or an African  American, or Asian American, or Latino/a American. We readily acknowledge  that it would be inappropriate to dress up in blackface, etc. The same  acknowledgement and respect is due Native Americans 
 Sorry, Babs.  You can't call yourself a Christian and also be so judgmental about your son or the so-called "homosexual lifestyle."  If we're throwing labels around, we might just as well call it "the heterosexual lifestyle." Gimme a break; it's 2004, lady. 
 Another abysmal reprint of mind numbing market lore from days gone by. Not worth the time to open. Read Gustave le Bon and learn something useful. Line the birdcage with this 
 Buying this DeLonghi deep fryer  has turned out to be our worst online shopping experience. We bought it in fall 2006. It broke down and started to spill oil after several usages. We took it to the DeLonghi's local service in Chicago, which looked more like a trading place for stolen goods. DeLonghi has basically subcontracted its service in whole Chicago area to a rundown and out-of-times local repairing shop. That was in mid-January. Now it is early April and not surprisingly we still wait to hear from the service. Our repeated calls to the local service and the DeLonghi did not produce any results. Obviously,DeLonghi, which is based in Italy, has a very unreliable and inefficient network in the USA. If you live in the USA and has a malfunctioning DeLonghi product, expect for the worst. DeLonghi is not a trustworthy brand here. 
 If you can't use dryer sheets or fabric softener, this is better than nothing at all.  Static cling still abounds, unfortunately.  Many times the balls get stuck in arms of clothing so it takes a bit of searching before starting the next load.  Not a big deal.  I'm glad I bought them, but I still long to use dryer sheets 
 If you ever get the chance to read  The Yearling  by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings--DON'T. A better use of your time would be to lick your car clean. This is the absolute WORST book I have ever read. It drags on forever with unnecessary descriptions of the trees and grass; there is no discernable plot, just a lot of nonsense vignettes; and--most importantly--it is boring. I hope that by writing this Mrs. Rawlings is spinning in her grave, because that would be more interesting than this book. I would not hesitate to give this book no stars at all--but Amazon only offers a one-star option. But I don't give a single star.   Not.  One.    
 I have not read this book.  But I clicked on the link for information about the author, and was taken to his publisher's website.  It was filled with Mr. Capt's books, and many others on (pro) Identity movement, British Israelism, the superiority of the white race, disbelief in a literal hell, etc.  I am caucasion, and I strongly disagree with these cult beliefs, so I would not consider reading books by Mr. Capt other than to see what a twisted version of a topic from the Bible said.  Evangelicals--beware!  Make sure you know what you are getting 
 Parts of this book are very well written, indeed!  Some of the author's descriptions of the Provencal countryside make you want to be there -- right now!!  On the other hand, I felt as though there was more book than we got.  Ms. Huntley's focus on her emotional state of mind and her interpersonal relationships struck me as unnecessary and, forgive me, boring.  I still can't figure out why she didn't just bonk the guide to begin with, concentrate on her travelogue and leave the reader out of her emotional teeth-gnashing.  Her writing is at its best when telling us of her daily trips into the countryside of Provence.  I must admit that Provence tends to draw out the romanticist in most of us and, in many ways, I am sympathetic to her state of mind.  She should spend more than eight days there and then write more about it 
 Cold Mountain is an unfortunate novel.  It is unfortunate it won the National Book award (why did it win?).  The novel has an unfortunate structure; Fraser simply strings along one incident after another, with little connecting thread.  The weight of flashbacks alone drags the novel to the ground (and it hardly gets off the ground in the first place!)  There are glaring anachronisms.  It is difficult to believe that some of the sentiments he puts in his characters mouths could have been uttered in 1864.  This is a forgivable sin, if the novel is well written, if it rises about the banal, if it offers something more than surface.  But this novel is all surfaces and all banality.  Its publication is indicative of some of the pathology of today's publishing world (this will be a BIG novel, this will become a BIGGER film, which will sell more of this BIG novel).  Too bad for us the novel does not justify the claims of its promoters.  Fraser's eight million dollar advance for his next work is probably a clarion signal of another BIG novel to come 
 I agree with S. Haus.  I was also disappointed.  The interiors of the homes in the book are generally dark and unwelcoming (unlike the one on the cover).  I prefer the multitudes of other books that combine accurate colonial decorative schemes with a modern, lived-in feel, rather than something straight out of a tour of Benjamin Franklin's 18th century home.  Not sure why some other reviewers seem to attack the S. Haus review; makes me wonder if they know the author personally 
 After reading Phantoms in the Brain, I was excited to see another book out by V.S. Ramachandran.  Sadly, this book is just a dumbed-down rehash of Phantoms.  There are only a few snippets of actual new material in this book and they're not covered in any kind of depth.  Additionally, he introduces his own personal opinions regarding the human condition that have nothing to do with the studies of the brain.  It doesn't even fit at all into the flow of the book.  Don't bother reading this book if you've already read Phantoms in the Brain.  But if you haven't read it, I highly, highly recommend Phantoms.   
 I love Sesame Street and I love watching it with my 16 month old daughter.  However, I found this video to be a major let down.  The people are so annoying.  I found the flashing lights (used to make it look like American Bandstand) distracting.  I can't imagine that they were good for my little one's eyes.  Fortunately I rented this one from Netflix before buying.  If you want a dance along Sesame video, try Zoe's Dance Moves 
 I'd been hearing about the wonderful writing of John Le Carre for quite some time, so I picked up The Constant Gardener for a fun read . . . and it was anything but.  And while I don't know if this is typical of the LeCarre spy novels, I certainly hope not.  The plot is basically a single man versus international conspiracy.  It's a plot that would normally catch my attention early and have my sympathy from the start. Further, it's a commentary on the abuses of power wrought by corporations (in this case, Pharmaceutical) that are more powerful than governments.  Again, a device that immediately evokes common interests with me, an unabashed liberal.  Unfortunately that's where the book and I part ways.  Justin, the minor diplomat in Nairobi is thrown into an unfortunate series of discoveries when questioning the circumstances of his wife's rape and murder.  Tessa differed from Justin in that she was engaged in pursuing change in the world as a human rights activist, while he was content to follow orders, but say and believe the right things sans effort.  This, I believe is the theme of the work, that culpability lies mostly with inaction and that movements can overcome abuses of power.  Good theme, but . . .  The execution was poor.  Pages and pages devoted to characterization fell short when actions didn't meet the set-up.  As well, Justin's investigation took him around the world to look at a paper trail, not the most interesting tools of the thriller game.  But we, as well as the character, examined the words and trail meticulously to the point where it became a joke how quickly the volume would put me to sleep.  Justin is such a luddite that we, as the reader, are forced to learn about computers, emails, and the myriad electronic communication pathways along with the protagonist . . . LeCarre would have been well-suited to find a heartless editor, because the plot that does exist is not much more substantial than what a novella would handle nicely.  Bureaucracy can be handled in a paragraph where the author wants the reader as frustrated as his bureaucrat protagonist, an interesting irony done uninterestingly.  This isn't to say that LeCarre is a poor writer - his sentence construction is strong and his mastery of the craft evident.  I'm going to try another of his novels just because I believe this was an aberration caused by an author with an axe to grind and no right way to do it.  Another problem was that he telegraphed the plot.  The only one stupid enough not to see who was behind the murder and conspiracy was Justin himself.  While this can work, showing the reader what the protagonist can't see (see Fight Club), in this case it's just painful to have to slough through the machinations of bumbling intrigue with a dull and plodding man.   In summary, I didn't care about characters and I lost interest in the plot and the theme seemed contrived.  I can't recommend it.  - CV Ric 
 At the first two days the product worked just fine (misty and quiet). After the second refilling the humidifier started to make noises (a motor like sound the first 10 minutes and heavy drops sound all the time). - So I had to return it. Secondly, to refill the tank you have to remove it and turn it upside down - Water always get spilled on my carpet during that process 
 Ghyka attempts to show the objects in nature are not randomly formed; he begins the with the concept of ratio and proportion in the plane; the golden section; and then to the regular polygons and geometric shapes in 3 dimensions.  Then he rambles onto hypothesizing why an architecture design may seem striking. In doing so he makes gross assumptions which are to the point of being forced to fit his theories.  The basic concepts that he delves; one can familiarize oneself with by a quick reference on the internet. Hence I do not recommend spending the time and money to read this book.  
 I tried to read this book, but could not finish it.  The book had an interesting message, but it was lost in the inaccuracies, broad sweeping statements, and linear logic.    His comments about Peak Oil were inaccurate.  There are plenty of books (1,000 Barrels a Second, for example) that address the issues accurately with much more thoughtful insight.      With regard to broad sweeping statements he makes comments like the southeast is prone to individuality and violence.  He failed to mention that when it comes to a sense of community and willingness to help their fellow man there is no better place to live then the southeast.  (For the record I am originally from the upper Midwest, but lived in the southeast for 7 years.)  Much of his prognostications about the future are linear, that is if a then b then c.  The author is in his late 50s and I would think by this time he would have figured out that life is a dynamic process that constantly adjusts to its environment.  If the cost of energy is too high people buy better gas mileage cars, drive less, close off portions of the house in the winter, don't use the air conditioner, purchase smaller homes, etc.  If the environment changes people constantly adjust including me, the author, and you.  What bothers me most about the book is that young people with less "life-experience" will read this book and believe this is the way it is going to be.  The author's book is just one more scenario of what could happen in the future.  But if life is a dynamic process, the constant adjustments to the environment makes it really hard to predict what will occur 
 As an expectant mother of bi-cultural, bi-racial, and hopefuly bi-lingual child, I am reading any kind of books which might help me. On the contrary to many praises, this book was a big dissapointment for me. The authors keep repeating the same thing chapter after chapter, and failed to give any concrete evidence to explain why. If you just want to read many bits and pieces opinions from bilingual children's parents, this may be the right book for you. I rather recommend "The Bilingual Family. 
 Quite simply, all the adult characters in this book are downright mean.  What's with the dark gloomy tone of this book for children??  No thanks.  On lessons of life and love, I'll take "The Giving Tree" any day. 
 I have read a number of books at this point on grand unification and theory of everything.  This book in particular deals with superstrings as a means by which to unify the physical forces.  From a personal standpoint I do not like superstring theory as the answer to grand cosmological problems.  The readability is also poor and the writing is disjointed.  Last, I prefer the works of Martin Rees and Kip Thorne to Kaku.  Again this book is very disjointed and does not even present superstrings all that well.  Spend your money elsewhere, on the afformentioned authors, or check out some Feynman books if it is unified force type of stuff 
 Have a Zen Vision M and this thing does not fit. It is about 4mm too wide and 2 mm too tall to fit on the screen. It does not tuck into or slip under the plastic around the screen either. Go figure 
 this movie is one of the 3 ~worst~ movies I've ever seen. these 98 minutes seemed more like 6 hours.  and for chrissake - he's NOT an american 
 Malfunctions: 1. The port for connecting to a PC became loose and unreliable, frequently disconnecting while I was trying to transfer music. 2. The little knob stopped working properly:  it was no longer possible to fast-forward. 3. Finally, the screen cracked for me and no longer displayed anything.  Design issues: It would be nice to be able to access music by ID3 tag (i.e. artist, genre, song title). It takes a long time to start up, generally ~20 seconds but up to ~2 minutes if you just changed the music on it. It's nice that you can delete music on the player without having to connect it to a computer, for instance if you have it on shuffle and you come across something that you never want to hear again.  However, the interface to do this was so inconvenient (including audio playback stopping and long lag times) that I rarely used this feature in practice. The earbuds that come with it didn't stay in my ears well; I bought new ones.  Good things: I loved the fact that it had an FM radio and a voice recorder (the reasons that I bought it). It's easy to access the hard drive from any computer, without any software needed. The large storage capacity proved fully necessary. You can change playback modes with a single button press (shuffle versus ordered, all songs versus current folder only).  My basis for comparison:  I've also owned a Creative Zen Jukebox (which I liked a lot but which I sold because I wanted the FM radio and voice recorder on the iAudio) and, currently, a used fourth generation iPod, which has been working well so far except for some occasional quirks 
 Mick Garris created the Showtime "Masters of Horror" series, so it is quite a surprise to discover that his first contribution to the show could not be properly called "horror" at all, let alone "masterful."  Mick has made a living out of adapting Stephen King novels for the screen (and we all know how those usually turn out), so it's no wonder that this little vignette plays like a short story with all the good parts cut out.  Jamie (played by a mealy-mouthed Henry Thomas) is lonely, divorced, and living on old toast when he begins to experience all of the sensations of a beautiful Canadian woman.  He smells what she smells, sees what she sees, feels what she feels.  (In true "Masters of Horror" fashion, many of these shared sensations involve sex and nudity.)  Ever more obsessed, Jamie tracks this woman down, only to discover her HORRIFYING SECRET!  What is her horrifying secret?  I'll tell you!    [SPOILER ALERT]   She is not a very nice person.  Also, for some reason, she keeps a gun under her couch.  I'm not joking. [END OF SPOILERS]  But seriously, this is just very, very bad entertainment.  In fact, the most creative part of the entire show is little more than a lame inside joke.  At one point, we catch a glimpse of a Stephen King novel, "Desperation," on Jamie's nightstand.  Ho ho!  Garris directed the TV adaptation of "Desperation," which just so happened to star both Thomas and Matt Frewer (who, in "Chocolate," has the only interesting character: Jamie's co-worker, Wally -- scientist-by-day, mohawked rock-n-roller by night).  The story of "Chocolate" is told in flashback by Jamie, who is sitting in a dark room, under a lamp, covered in blood.  He is being questioned by a cop, and his dull, pointless story unfolds as he answers each inquiry.  At the very end, when the cop has heard every, last, mind-numbing detail, the cop gives the penultimate line of the show:  "That's a hard story to sell."  You're right, Unnamed Cop.  It's a REALLY hard story to sell, especially when the salesmanship is this bad 
 I've read all the previous Rita Mae Brown/Sneaky Pie Brown collaberations, so I was excited to see a new one at my local library.  Being a murder mystery fan and cat lover, I've truly enjoyed reading the series.  The best parts are the animals speaking (I love Pewter) and I have a special fondness for Mrs. Murphy because that's who I am (Mrs. Barbara Murphy).  I love Harry, and I don't mind that she's not at the post office anymore.  Her new adventures in grape growing and farming is who she really is--a country girl brought up on a farm.  But I have to say I also forced myself to keep reading this book assuming (hoping) that as I went further, the plot would get better.  I believe it took well over a 100 pages (or maybe it just seemed that long) to get to the "murder".  It also seemed that many of the "regular" characters were missing or barely mentioned especially Miranda, who is a big influence in Harry's life.  I think it was because of the way Ms. Brown went on and on about the biological terrorism, etc--it was like I was reading Time or Newsweek, not a fun, fictional murder mystery.  The winery settings and grape growing were interesting, but some of the conversations that took place between Fair and Harry, or Fair and BoomBoom about the diseases, etc. just didn't seem realistic.  As the story moved along, it did get a little easier to read, but I have to admit, for the first time, it was too obvious who did it and why.  I enjoyed the ending with all of the animals from the barn getting into the mix.  Well, I see another book is coming out early next year.  I'm still looking forward to reading it. 
 "The Politics of Law" is a collection of essays by legal scholars from a progressive point of view, or rather a range of progressive points of view. Every major topic of law has one or two essays criticizing the current legislation and jurisprudence from a leftist perspective. Attention is paid not just to traditional injustices such as racism and access difficulties, but also more modern subjects like gay rights, feminism and the environment. So far, so good.  The essays themselves, however, are by and large very disappointing. About half of them are so general and so vaguely outline areas that may or may not be a problem that may or may not be worth addressing either inside or outside the legal scholarship, and so on, that they are largely useless to any reader but the most uninitiated. The other half tend to be thorough in their critiques, but make far too many assumptions about the nature progressive criticism should take, and often merely assert their critiques with no evidence at all. For example, whether affirmative action is to be considered good or bad from a radical progressive perspective is quite a debatable topic, but in this book it is basically assumed that the reader is an avid proponent. Same thing with constitutional jurisprudence such as Griswold vs. Connecticut and Roe vs. Wade; one can very well make a leftist argument against such creations as a "right to privacy" by emphasizing its antidemocratic constructs, but no attention is paid to this at all.   That seems to be the main problem with almost all essays in the main part of the book (Kairys' own article on free speech is a notable exception): there is a very strong presumption in favor of legal and especially judicial resolution of social problems, as opposed to for example a call for a more thorough democratization. It's probably because of the background of the contributors as law professors and radical lawyers that this top-down legal tendency is incorporated in all the criticisms, but it is not at all uncontested in radical progressive circles.  Finally, there are quite some silly mistakes and poor reasonings. Consistently misspelling Lochner as "Lockner" and implying that the 'imminent lawless action' test and the 'clear and present danger' test are the same are errors that should not be in any professional legal work. Rhonda Copelon's article explaining why the US is evil for not immediately implementing the various UN declarations' assertions such as "the right to the continuous improvement of living conditions" consists of nothing but angry assertions and makes a very amateuristic impression. The constant invocation of "the conservative Rehnquist court" as some sort of conspiracy to take away all civil rights, without any backup or argumentation whatever, is shrill and stupid.  The main virtues of this collection are the broad reach of its criticism and the last couple of essays, gathered under the header "progressive approaches to the law". These articles are more theoretical in nature and discuss the relation between progressive political views, especially radical ones, and legal systems. Particularly worthwhile is Cornel West's discussion of the role of law vis-à-vis radical leftist movements in the United States. The reader would do best to borrow this from the library to read that essay, and not to bother with the rest 
 The first hundred or so pages of the novel are fairly interesting and easy to get through but from there the book seams to go nowhere.  I had a very hard time trying to get through the rest of the novel as it meanders towards its anticlimactic ending.  Yes there is some beautiful writing and keen social observations but all and all it was quite dull.  It was disappointed after reading the previous reviews and hearing good things about this book I found myself trying to like but it was just too slow paced for me 
 "He was cringing, fighting the straps with amazing strength. His hands turned red and then white and the cords of the neck stood out like steel bands. The force of the electrical current was so powerful that his eyeballs popped out and rested on cheeks.  Finally, he caught the fire. His brain was boiling."  Shocking?  This is the description of the sufferings of prisoner being electrocuted.  In U.S.A.  In XXI century.  Taken out of context - what does it say about Americans?  Is that a true picture?  
 This is the only one of the series that I've read, and now I doubt I'll bother with the others.  Conant has hung a bunch of red-herring plot twists and turns on a simplistic semi-mystery that in the end is nothing more than a guilty-family-secret story.  Nazis, eugenics, dog shows in the thirties, a Rockefeller heiress, the Isabelle Stewart Gardner museum -- all turn out to be irrelevant to the story line... 
 I don't know if I just got an old/bad copy of the set, but for one thing, the episodes are misnumbered and out of order. More perplexing, however, is that some of the audio track is missing. For example, in ep. 1.08 (dunno what # it is on the DVDs), Apophis has no voice at all, even though his script is still shown on the CC. (DVD has no english subtitles, but the TV's captions work). He can be heard if it is switched to the Spanish or French audio track, but not in English 
 This was my first Ruth Rendell novel.  I picked it up after seeing her name appear with very high praise on a list of top psychological thriller reads.  Based on this novel, I'd call her more of a literary fiction mystery writer.  The action doesn't really pick up until the half-way point in the book, but then steadily increases to the strong ending.  I rated the book so low because I thought too much of the book (likely half) was superfluous narration to fill in the main characters's history.  I think I could have understood the position of both main characters without so much detail.  If it hadn't been for the list of thrillers to read, I might not have finished the book.  It began without a "hook", prompting me to read on, but I kept thinking that there must be more if she is such a prominent author.  Some day I might try another Rendell/Vine novel, but I'd make sure it came with plenty of hot reviews and a quicker pace 
 Like the other reviewer of this cd, I am also a fan of Buffalo Tom. Unfortunately this doesn't sound very similar to BT, in fact it is a bit dull.  None of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick - after you hear it you instantly forget it. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair, since I only played it 3 times, hoping it would grow on me.  I'd recommend "Up Here" instead of this one, it's much more listener friendly 
 nice and handy, but i don't like the spiral format. pages are flimsy and begin to rip and shear off shortly  after purchase even with careful moderate use. just a waste of money. the only difference between the quick and the desk is the inclusion of the coding chart with the desk reference. 
 This book was a complete waste of time. I was looking for some help and some direction in my life, and it gave me nothing but common sense. I would invest in a different book if u are interested in this one. Plus, it is way overpriced and over 10 years old. 
 I bought this book 2 years ago - almost to the day...I have the receipt stuck in the book...I can only seem to force myself to get to page 50 and then I just can't stomach anymore and I put it down for 2 more years. Maybe this is a piece of art. Something to be treasured and something that should change your life. But pleasure reading shouldn't be this painful. I wish the store would take it back - but I think I've probably had it for too long 
 I would like to give this version 5 stars, i love the movie, but this is the Dimension release which only offers an English language dub. If that's OK by you, then this is the cheaper version, but if you are a purist like me, you'll want the Cantonese/Mandarin version with English subtitles 
 Since this seems to be the subtext of the book Are Men Necessary, I think it should have been the title.  I read her excerpt from Are Men Necessary: "What's a Modern Girl To Do." I am giving it two stars because as a graphic designer, I like the 50s-style book cover illustration of the woman in the red dress reading a book in a subway train while the male passengers are watching her.   I am a single woman just like Maureen Dowd. But I think I know why she is having trouble dating.  She only goes out with rich, powerful men; usually celebrities, Republicrat or Demopublican politicians, and Beltway journalists sycophantic to them. These men probably really don't want a smart, talented woman. Why would they, when they're used to dating women who are just as shallow as themselves, and, if they're Beltway journalists, don't seem to dare criticize the Bush Administration like she does? For this very reason, her making fun of the Bushies and John Kerry in her columns probably alienates these men from her even further. I wouldn't be surprised if these very same men loathed Stephen Colbert and anonymously left death threats on his voicemail after he ranked on George Bush at the correspondents' dinner last April. Although her columns do sound bitchy and childish and no less superficial than her dates do; since these articles dwell on the politicians' personalities more than their policies.  I live in San Francisco, and do computer art and consulting for a living. I'm sure this requires more brain-power than writing a fluffy book complaining that men don't like smart women. I've been to Burning Man. I'm in the Green Party. Why am I mentioning these all-too-personal-and-irrelevant things? Because if these men don't want to date Maureen Dowd because she's too talented as she claims, they would probably not want to even think about dating a semi-hippie computer geek like myself. If she's really too smart for them, they'd consider me too much of a freak.  But I accept this. I guess it's much easier for me to not lose sleep over the fact that elite men are probably not going to like someone like me than it seems to be for Maureen Dowd. Because these men are not part of my world, but hers.  I'm not surprised she assumes that all men hate smart, talented women. It's because these are the only types of men she associates with. Fortunately, there are lots of decent, thoughtful, hard-working men out there who are not nearly this petty. But if she really wants to find them, she'll have to get out of her Hollywood-Beltway ghetto/ivory tower and into the real world.  To summarize, "What's a Modern Girl To Do" is nothing more than a sour-gripes-fest complaining that she can't get a rich, powerful man. Well, I can't either.  Maureen needs to hang out with a different crowd, like I do 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 Some reviewer here said that the astros didn't score any runs. That is inaccurate. They did score many runs, but didn't win any games. I was at game 4 in Houston where backe was awesome but we couldn't score. Our offense just didn't do the job. But I'm still proud of the stros for the amazing run down 15-30 and left for dead all the way to the series. GO ASTROS. There are die hard astro fans out there like me 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 I work for a book summary company.  One of the books selected for summary is this book.  When you have the world famous author who made the startling expose on the Watergate scandal and Assistant Managing Editor of Washington Post, write about the eventful hours following the 9/11 attack at the World Trade Center, your expectations are naturally very high.  But Woodward lets you down, as this book leans heavily on transcripts of National Security Council meetings and extended interviews including over 4 hours of interview with George Bush, to reveal the layers of decision making process that followed the cataclysmic incident.  By providing the details of the close-door meetings amongst the key central players, we do get to size up partially on the personality of those involved.  We are privy to the arguments and ideological differences amongst the principal leaders as President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, CIA Director George Tenet, and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, forcefully put their weight and power behind their viewpoints and decisions.  We are treated to how the CIA successfully waged an intelligence war against Afghanistan leading to the fall of the Taliban.  Beyond that we get precious little in terms of clear opinion on the dynamics of the decision making or the wisdom behind it.  A mere reportage of the collection of meetings and interviews are best served in a newspaper, and thus could ideally have found its way into Washington Post.  In the publication of a book, we expect a renowned media investigator as Woodward to undertake a more serious study such as on policy matters or the depth of leadership involved or an incisive analysis of personalities and so forth.  This is a rather tame book and hardly adds anything of great value, and much less so to the trailblazing work that Woodward is capable of.  
 I was forced to read this in 10th grade but could hardly bear reading it.  Initially, I'd had high hopes for it, because we'd read such intelligent, intriguing novels earlier in the year, including "Lord of the Flies" and "Catcher in the Rye."  But what a bore it was! Old Santiago goes out to fish, hoping to catch the "big one" (drawing on the innate male desire to always catch the best, biggest thing.."that must mean I'm macho, a real man!"), blah blah blah, can't catch anything, blah blah blah, and when he finally catches the big one, it is eaten by sharks. The stupidest book ever. I've never been a Hemingway fan, and this book steered me further away from his work.  A pathetic book by a pathetic man 
 We found out too late that this was a bootlegged copy!  Beware 
 After reading this book's predecessor, "Travelers' Tales:  Food," I had been eagerly waiting for the next volume of stories.  This book falls far short of the standard set in "Food."  None of  the stories are particularly memorable, enlightening or even entertaining.   Many have little to do with travel experiences.  While I really love the  Travelers' Tales books in general, this one was truly dissapointing 
 As a 23-year Marine pilot myself, I thought Weber's work would be of special interest to me, but it was a big waste of time, forcing me to scan the last few chapters just to get it over with.  His special anti-terrorist team spend more time worrying about themselves while they break up their equipment, all the while coming up with "cutsie" conversation--and they don't accomplish a thing--but Uncle Sam pays them handsomely.  Even his side stories (which rarely affect the story line)about how terrible and scary it is to fly military aircraft are filled with supercilious thoughts by the pilots who are about to die.  In Chapter 27 (of 34), he brings in a totally new character who smashes up his plane on a carrier landing.  He lives, but is never mentioned in the book again, nor is the incident connected to the story.  Weber does, however, emulate W.E.B. Griffin in one respect--all his characters are either independently wealthy or have super-wealthy donors, so they need not worry about any expense whatever.  And they are all officers.  No mention of the grunts who make everything possible  Weber is touted as a "Marine Pilot", but no mention of what he flew, or where---???? 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 I love chick-lit and this book was just average.  It took me a really long time to read because it was a book I could easily put down.  
 Anything Goes is a fabulous musical from the stage of the 1930s containing show girls, gangsters, and romance. However, this film version has very little of the above and therefore has only mild entertainment value.   Bing Crosby and Donald O'Connor play stage stars, both enjoyable in their own right. They need a female lead for the show, so they split up in search of one. Crosby digs up Mitzi Gaynor and O'Connor finds Zizi Jeanmaire, neither of them expecting the other to find a girl. Herein lies the problem. Both girls believe they will be starring in the show. Steps are taken to let one of the girls down easily, but both men fall in love with the other man's choice of a star.   With songs from the original musical peppered throughout, the songs lose their meaning in a different context. The choreography is uninspiring and that singing is not all that great despite the major names featured. This one is a real bomb 
 Don't fall for this. The authors are conservative propagandists who engage in the kind of fake scholarship that the American Enterprise Institute and its ilk specializes in. Remember when you were first learning to write a term paper and the teacher said "don't make the facts fit your argument; your argument has to rest on the facts"? Well the authors were busy running for class president and missed that little lesson. In their world, there is no reason to worry about discrimination laws, or social security, or poverty relief because no-one is ever destitute, excluded or unable to get decent work. Anyone with a passing acquaintance with reality can recognise this for the class warfare that it really is 
 The book is extremely vague.  I thought the book would contain plans to construct forts, playhouses, etc.  This is not the case. The book has drawings with a few overall dimensions, but lacks specifics.  It does not contain plans, materials lists, etc.  This is not a "how to" book.  
 I didn't like how the author has chosen to label the character's anxiety as his "autism".  This book conveys the message that his autism is the label of his bad feelings or his feelings that are out of control.  I wish the author had chosen a different word to describe the character's feelings, such as anger, impatience, or anxiety.  Instead, they are labeled as his "autism".  It's an uphill battle to fight against the negative impressions of autism.  My message to my kids is that their autism is part of what makes them interesting (and it's true).  
 I recently returned from a 3 month tour of Europe and took this book with me. While it did have a number of major European cities in it the actual information about them was definetly lacking. I found my self usually better off with out a book at all as opposed to only having this one. Several other travelers we met felt the same way and some were lucky enough to have Lonely Planet guides. For the money spent I'll stick to them or Rick Steves in the future. i.e. This book would take you to the train station/ subway but then fall short on what the heck to do to get a ticket!!! Which is important information stranded in 20 different stations/ subways a month each with different customs. Frommer's did do an excellent job of pointing out all of the gay and lesbian districs and bars in each city and the gay friendly hotels and shops... but they also have a strickly gay guide to Europe as well. The amount of space used for this information could have been better allocated for more pertinent information. I'll have to give a thumbs down on this book. Take something else with you or take nothing at all 
 I am not sure if these Reviews are from 'Paid' people but  If you atteneded any of her seminars from Learning Annexe, you will find out that she is basically selling you $6,000 seminars using this book. I have been to one of her seminar and it is all confusing and it will sure confuse you.  BUT , if you pay $6,000 , you will know what Martha beck is saying.   I was conviced that this is 'NOT' what you expected from her book or seminars.   Keep away from this Stuff, there are lot of useful / helpful people / books on amazon. Her seminars are so confusing that after spending 3-4 hours , you will try to find out 'What I need to do ' ?.  You are paying for her 'Marketing Ideas' by buying this Book..   Keep Away ,  
 Circlet/Tan would do well to consider quality over quantity, with far too many mediocre books coming out of late. Seeking talent, not just filling space, would improve upon this and several other collections 
 Ha!  This is almost as good as Norman Leff's combat jujitsu book.  Here the production value is better, and obviously our heroes are athletes. I like this book a lot for the same reason I like kung fu movies.  Here is the secret to the ninja fighting success of the old days.  When you attack someone from behind or while they are asleep, or from a distance with a projectile weapon, you have a high probability of success.  Why?  Because your opponent can't really fight back very well.  Reading this book has helped me to understand why ninjas preferred to kill people or beat them up while they were unaware.  The sad fact is that people buy this book and its premise.  They think it is a worthwhile art for self-defense instead of seeing it as the great joke that it is 
 let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with "natives"?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive "guesting" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer.  
 I found this book similar to modern movies that are all special effects and no substance. Almost everything is told in an over dramatic way. The author tries to build excitement by creating it himself, rather than just telling the story. This book pales in comparison with astronaut Michael Collin's excellent autobiography, "Carrying the Fire". 
 Before browsing through Dear Donald, Dear Bennett, the reader should immediately peruse a copy of At Random, Bennett Cerf's memoirs, so he has a chance of understanding what he is reading in this book. I can't believe Random House would treat the personal letters of their founders in such a shabby fashion. Virtually no footnotes, no annotation, no index---nothing. They might as well be putting out the memoirs of Anna Nicole Smith, rather than the keepers of one of the great literary storehouses of the twentieth century. Before spending any money assembling this volume for publication (if indeed they spent any at all!), the editors should have acquired a copy of The Noel Coward Diaries and followed it religiously as a guide. In that volume, Graham Payn and Sheridan Morely obviously spent months poring over every inch of copy, meticulously footnoting each and every name and archane reference so that upon completion, the reader would easily be able to tell the difference between Bob Menzies and Bobby Andrews, the Duke of Kent from the Duke of Windsor, and easily tell whether Sir Noel was writing about Elizabeth Taylor the film star, Elizabeth Taylor the English novelist, or Elizabeth Taylor the non-celebrity dear friend to Coward's inner circle. Here, the editors (who are unnamed and rightly so) merely say that Saxe Commins was a senior editor at Random House and Robert Haas a partner without furthur definition. (More time is spent discussing the typeface of this volume than virtually anything else.) Most readers of these letters would be interested in the details such annotation would provide. Yes, the letters do paint a wonderful picture of the day-to-day operations of the company, the trials and tribulations of America at war, and the deep affection between the two men. It's a shame the present-day editors at Random House did not see fit to put together a better tribute of their founding fathers 
 This wasn't such a bad novel, and I kind of enjoyed it.  Not great, but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly.  However, the ending really killed it for me.  It's too unnecessarily long.  Once the major conflict is resolved, the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah.  I wish I'd just put the book down after the rain because I would've left with a feeling of at least entertainment.  But after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications, only pages of explanations, I just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book.  Would've been three stars if it'd just known when to end 
 I purchased this item a a reputable retailer in New York, NY (B&H Photo).  You couldn't beat the price of $139.95 plus tax for a 5GB mp3 player with FM tuner and speakers.  I had a problem with the set up.  I was not able to install the music management program to get my music onto the player.   The player did not come with any CD so I installed the software as instructed by Virgin's "customer support."  and as per the quick start manual.  I also updated the player with the latest firmware as per the instructions of customer support.  I still could not transfer my songs.     I've e-mailed them twice within 24 hours detailing my situation but all they wrote back was to do the same thing all over again as I explained abve.  They kept referring me to the web site but there is no link for the management software.  It only have the firmware updates and the player desktop update which does not contain the music management software.  The only thing that works is the FM tuner.   The player along with the speakers is a great deal for the money.  However, given the fact that I cannot put my music on it doesn't make it worth it 
 The movie is awesome - 5 stars.  HD DVD transfer looks grainy (digital noise) and the colors are off and washed out. As crazy as it sounds, it looks worse then I remember it on VHS. Anyway, the standard DVD is better than this on an upconvert DVD player.  Really dissapointing.... 
 For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it 
 As a child born to the same type of immigrants she bewails in her book, Malkin is a quivering mass of hypocrisy.  She and Annie Coulter would make a great couple 
 The Third Secret is another entry in the Vatican intrigue genre. It has the usual elements: Vatican conservatives the usual bad guys vs liberal Catholics the usual good guys. The "Third Secret" refers to secret revelations given to Marian visionaries at such places as Fatima and Medjugorge, the existence of which is historical fact. If there is any suspense in the novel, it is not with the plot which is remarkably predictable and derivative. The only thing that kept my interest was waiting to find out the actual content of the third secret(s), at least according to the novel's author. In the end, these proved to be rather predictable too, given the author's religious inclinations 
 I'm a Cho fan, and consider "I'm the One that I Want" to be just about the best stand-up act ever made... If you like Cho, you definitely HAVE to see that one, her first release. This second one is quite possibly the WORST stand-up act ever made. The lady definitely goes to extremes.  Where to begin? The lighting is poor, she looks like she's had a few too many, her jokes are stale reruns, and she's just plain off. I don't know what happened here, but she obviously does not understand the concept of Quality Control.  I made a special trip to Atlanta to see this one, being a big fan, and this is one of the ticket purchases that finally made me resolve NEVER AGAIN to buy movie tickets and just wait until things come out on DVD and I can rent them cheaply. Because, most movies are crap!  Two stars instead of one because of probably misguided and irrelevant residual gratitude left over from her first stand-up DVD 
 I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it 
 After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone, I purchased.  Here are the main issues I have found with this phone:  1) The buttons are too small, particularly the main control button.  You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time. And, believe me, I do not have very large hands.  2) If you have quite a few contacts in your phone, you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact.  You will notice that if you are not careful, you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly, so if this is you, be aware.  3) You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message.  VERY INCONVENIENT!!  There is no indication to show this on the top screen, only the inside screen.  4) On occasion, the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely.  What you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again.  Not optimal, and I probably just got a bad phone, but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent, so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola.  NOTE:  I have no personal vendetta against Motorola, but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I bought into before purchasing 
 The book is very out of date. Don't bother trying to find any of the restaurants or stores listed. They have probably closed or changed their names. Of about 10 establishments I tried to track down, 7 were not there or had wrong directions. There is no update on their web site 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 I have taken a look at all the main translations out there and have to strongly disagree with the other reviews here that Bloom does the most faithful or "best" translation.  I have a few reasons to be suspicious about Bloom's work here:  1. As a student of Strauss, Bloom learnt well the power of esotericism. That means to me he is both aware of (and possibly) uses esotericism as part of the translation. I didn't like the idea of ideologues such as the Straussians having anything to do with a text that is already pregnant with esoteric meaning. Read Strauss if you wish (I did) to develop one's understanding of The Republic but read another translation as one's reference. It will help you come to your own conclusions about this towering and radical work of philosophy.  2. I've applied a very quick litmus test of "safe" translations by going straight to 362a of the text to determine whether the translator has used the word "crucified", "crucify" or similar when referring to the punishment meted out to the just man. Some texts go further by "clarifying" that the translation should "literally" read 'impale' and from my point of view, use of the concept of crucifixion is way too close to what is to my mind a completely unnecessary and misleading Christianisation of the text. Interestingly, Bloom is credited with removing the long standing tradition of Christian-Platonic readings via the Straussian re-interpretation of Plato. However this version of The Republic by Bloom repeats this very significant mistranslation and puts into doubt the whole project undertaken by him.  Similarly, I rejected the penguin/Jowett versions that come from this same tradition.   So, what are my recommendations? I have to go with Grube/Reeve versions. They are atheistic/pantheistic, uncoloured but still poetic and powerful translations. One of Reeve's versions comes with the dialogue broken up against each character to assist with reading [...] but either version is excellent and I strongly recommend them over Bloom's version.   
 I expropriated this book from the Princeton History Department, where it was forlornly residing underneath a "Free To Anyone" sign. I got what I paid for. It's crap, and babble, and everything else that uniformly applies to anything written by a deconstructionist, structuralist, or similar academic mountebank. If you come across a copy, skim it for laughs. (Trust me: you won't have to get past the Introduction to find some uproariously awful sentences. 
 Really, I could write this book. I don't know why it has so many good reviews. The premise of the book is fantastic, but the book needed to be given to another writer. So many predictable and well-used novice symbolisms in this book. The characters aren't really likeable. The only reason I kept on reading was that I kept on waiting for the big climax. There was none. The ending was very poor. The beginning chapters went on and on and on...I wouldn't bother reading it. 
 I bought the CD because I was looking for piano music and this one was highly recommended by reviewers. Well, it sure is one boring piece of work! I somehow missed reference on the music style. So, to you all who may be doing the same mistake: it is a blues music for bars. Nothing great nor special about it really. It has something specifically American about it that I find difficult to relate to: too common, too simple, too simpleminded, too shortcoming. Sorry, but using piano for instrument doesn't make the music special; the melodies could have been played on harmonic or accordion instead and sold as folk-music 
 This is one of those movies that is on the AFI's "Top 100 films of all time" list. In my opinion that list is bogus. Only about a quarter of the films on that list deserve to be there. I don't think Easy Rider is anywhere close to one of the top 100 films of all time. Easy Rider seems fairly pointless. Billy(Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt (Peter Fonda) drive around on their choppers, pick up a hippie, and drive around some more. That sums up the first half of the film. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly boring, but it isn't exactly a great story either. To be honest this movie doesn't really have a story.  Dennis Hopper directed this film and the word is that he was completely stoned out of his mind. I can believe that. There is a scene at the end where the Billy and Wyatt drop some acid and go on a little trip with two hookers in a cemetary. To me it seems pretty easy to shoot an acid trip. Just shoot random stuff, cut it together randomly and voila! You have your scene. Or better yet, give the camera to a monkey. The out of focus shots and frenetic animal jerkiness will only add to the overall aesthetic of the scene. Its ok for the first 20 seconds, but anything longer than that gets monotonous.  Jack Nicholson is amazing as usual. He is so good, so convincing, and has such presence that he completely steals every scene that he is in. The other actors are good too in their own ways; Dennis Hopper made me laugh several times, but then again watching stoned guys do stupid things will usually make you laugh anyway.  The cinematography is very good. László Kovács does good work and he captures the scenery very well. God knows there is plenty of time for that during the course of the movie. There is a little incongruity towards the end when they try to match 16mm footage with the rest of the 35mm film, but other than that the picture is good. There are some weird things done with the editing that I didn't really understand or care for. There is a reoccuring theme of stuttering images before cutting to a new scene. It kind of seems like a film student experiment that was left in the film accidently.  I'll bet this movie was great back in the days of hippies and woodstock, but now it just comes off flat. It does give some insight into that time period, but there are many other better films that can do the same thing and tell you a story at the same time.  My rating: 2 of  
 The authors mistakenly believe the reader would be interested in ad nauseum details of their personal partying!  Nothing new or inspired in this tiny book 
 Who indeed?  This so-called Sherlock Holmes mystery is, quite possibly, the single worst film I have ever seen in my entire life.  Blandly written, appallingly over- and underacted, and unmemorably directed, "Hands of a Murderer" features such "delights" as a Watson with no personality whatsoever, a Sherlock who is actually stouter than Mycroft, and a laughable denouement.  I also found strange Moriarty's passionate "romance" with his female associate.  Since Moriarty is Holmes' mirror image, so to speak, writers should treat his love interests with the same delicacy they would treat Holmes' -- hinting more than revealing, and involving fascinating, intelligent women, not hammily acted hypnotists.  Most incredible of all, though, is the moment when Watson refers to Holmes as "Sherlock" -- something he would never, ever do in any book or film written by anyone who had read the Conan Doyle stories with any attention whatsoever.  Edward Woodward (of whom I still have fond memories as "The Equalizer") plays Sherlock Holmes as though the role is a straitjacket pinching him in uncomfortable places, forcing him to walk and talk strangely.  There is one good thing about this film:  it has quadrupled my already vast appreciation for the late, great Jeremy Brett 
 The book starts out well enough when banker Ben Hartman, in Switzerland on business, runs into an old college buddy who tries to kill him.  Then through a series of accidental discoveries, narrow escapes, and unbelievable coincidences, Hartman learns that practically everybody he knows, and everyone new he meets, is involved in an evil cabal bent on world domination. When you finally find out who the criminal mastermind is, it seems like something only Austin Powers' nemesis Dr. Evil could have pulled off.  Without giving too much away - I have to say that the ending involves the hero attempting a daring rescue from the villain's heavily-guarded, secret mountain lair.  And of course there is a scene where the villain feels the need to carry on a long monologue to explain his evil plot to the hero.  Yeah baby, yeah 
 I thought the "mafia did it" theory had been thoroughly discredited by now. Actually, it has been discredited. With all due respect to Mr. Palamara, this book is hardly the best book on the JFK assasination. It's not even close to being the best. The best book on the murder of JFK is John Armstrong's 'Harvey & Lee', a thoroughly documented tome that proves that there were two people using the name Lee Harvey Oswald, one a native Russian speaking man who's family came to the U.S. and who was put into a "false defector" program run by the State Department and CIA (Harvey), the other the real Lee Harvey Oswald (Lee) who was working with Ruby, Ferrie, Shaw, Bannister and others in gun running and anti-Castro activities and who helped set up Harvey as the patsy. Armstrong's book puts everything into perspective. Ultimate Sacrifice is barely worth your time to read. 
 great product. fun and educational, but this rubik's cube is very fragile and is hard to turn, so be careful. even if you only know how to do the original rubik's cube, this is not extremely difficult 
 Although not nearly as heinous as Richard Avedon's "In the American West", Stephen Shore's "Uncommon Places" earns an honored place in the annals of overrated art. Its sole interest is its time-capsule appeal.  Imagine if you will, taking a camera across America and shooting ugly buildings, roads, humble homes, and desolate scenery with nary a concern of cohesiveness or narrative. Make no attempt to include a theme, other than perhaps a New Yorker's condescension much like the lyrics in the Talking Heads song "The Big Country." You then have this book.   Perhaps 15-20 of these photgraphs hold some genuine magic. The rest are totally ridiculous. Much better is Eggleston's "Los Alamos."   Even the title is grating 
 The book's stated theme, "inside the great recording studios," is a tantalizing one. Unfortunately the authors rarely deliver the reader inside the temples themselves. Instead, they spend an inordinate amount of text rehashing introductory material about artists, songs, labels, musical genres and scenes. It's not necessarily uninteresting, but it leaves readers in the lobby, rather than actually taking them into the studio.  Worse, the writing is hugely uneven. The chapter on Atlantic is just that, a chapter on the Atlantic label, with tidbits about the studios they used. The chapter on Columbia, on the other hand, does a nice job of communicating the label's producers' emotional attachment to their studios. The text itself ranges from well-written to hyperbolic ("It is indisputable: there is no one label that had as much impact on the development of rock from the 1950s to the 1970s as Chess.") and overly clever ("Everyone wanted in, and the [Chess] brothers, refashioned as record men, kept adding more pawns to the Chess set.").  What this book does accomplish is a grounding of hit songs at their physical points of creation. It untangles the juxtaposition of Top-40 radio and strips away the music industry's placelessness by re-contextualizing songs with the writers, producers, engineers and musicians who created them. Who knew that Eric Clapton's "Layla" was recorded in Florida, within the same studios that reverberated with Hank Ballard's "The Twist," The Eagles' "Hotel California," and The Bee Gees "How Deep is Your Love?"  The book's photos provide intimate views of studios in use (not to mention, under construction), it's a shame that the accompanying text isn't as fully detailed on the technical and artistic inner-workings of these "temples of sound. 
 The music is right from the movie, however I was hoping for more of the instrumental music vs mainly lyrical 
 Just not that impressed with this book.  The write-up was much better than the book itself.  Superficial.  Will be selling my copy as used 
 Why would someone with such a low opinion of motherhood and babies have an obsessive need to bear offspring with a husband she doesn't live with and who, by the way, is the age of some great grandfathers? From the eye-catching title, I was expecting a humorous story about an older mom juggling career, marriage and motherhood. Instead, I found a disturbing glimpse into the life of a woman so unable to connect with her husband and children she lets readers in on her fantasies of killing them. Someone please alert social services!  
 Okay, I don't really know what to say about this book. But I try to teach myself how to do some problems out of the book and sometimes it's plain confusing. In the examples they give you steps but they don't really explain why you do the steps. They basically give you answers and it's not really a good book to learn from. A good teacher who knows how to teach would be good to add on with the book... 
 I got an email today to review this book, but I never received it.  I have contacted the customer service department 
 This is essentially another attempt at seperating profound German thinkers who were somehow idealistically affiliated indirectly with Nazism, from Hitler. Whether it be Nietzsche, Wagner or Strauss there is simply an ocean of oxymoronic literature devoted to *pretending* every free thinker and artist in history adopted the same judeo-christian "equality" ideals as a generic "free tookie" college marxist, in reality national socialism is a direct reality of Nietzsches bright fantasy, merciful lost Europe rallying in for once the defense of its own beauty rather than dwelling in self hatred and the worship of failing ethnicities, abolishing slavery thus being blamed for it, abolishing gender inequality thus being blamed for it. Nietzsche was a worshipper of beauty itself rather than the self loathing linear 'philosophy' of other westerners.  Nietzsche is often said to "oppose anti-semitism" to justify his hypothetical opposition to Nazism, yet in his own words describes Jews as foul smelling creatures (this is not to mention National Socialism has pro and anti jewish sects. The obvious proto-Nazi mental state of himself and his sister creates an obstacle for typical minded modern readers who are shocked initially by Nietzschean philosophy, thus an entire industry has been built around "disproving the racist lies" etc. For another example see the industry built around disproving the Bell Curve, another case of actually intelligent racism being flooded by leftist extremists, like Kathleen Higgins and Robert Solomon.  Anyone who truly understands Nietzche and comprehends genetic elitism, natural selection on a spiritually endorsed level, is better off buying pure translations of his work and cutting the introductions and editor notes out with a pair of scissors-thats what yours truly does.  This is, in all ways, another off shoot of the watered down politically correct anti-racist "nihilist" teenage movement, only for adults who appreciate nietzsche yet belong to a group he found unworthy 
 Well, This dvd is pretty bad, like everyone else said. It's 4 episodes recapping the previous 14, with narration from each character in the background. I believe they had to make these eps due to the fact that they needed to save some money in japan since they weren't getting high ratings on the anime series. Anyway, I didn't buy this dvd, because I have the japanese box set instead, which saved me a lot of $$. I watched each episode, and I must say the only part I liked was the opening and ending theme. Other than that, there really is no need to buy this dvd unless you are truly a die-hard wolf's rain fan. But, don't be surprised if you watch this dvd for 5 minutes and then throw it out the window. I really highly recommend renting this before you buy it, cause otherwise you are wasting your money 
 I cannot recommend this book. It's the same old stuff, an establishment archaeologist clinging to 1930's theories. He closes his mind to paradigm shattering works that render this book obsolete--works like "Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings" by Hapgood; "The Origin Map" by Brophy; and "Giza Powerplant," by Dunn. Instead of addressing the theories of researchers like Z. Sitchin, he unscientifically dismisses them with an unscientific smirk and a laugh, exposing an unwillingness to inspect anything that violates his establishment prejudices 
 Spiritual memoirs tend to follow the same plot line.  It's the boy meets girl story with God substituted for the girl.  There's nothing wrong with the formula, the author's job is to make it fresh and interesting.  Dan Wakefield doesn't get the job done.  The structure of "Returning" is linear, the pace is ponderous, and the insights only moderately interesting.  In fact, the entire book is an exercise in moderation, written by a moderate talent, who, on the evidence presented, has lived a moderate life.  It's no wonder Bill Moyer's, a paragon of moderation, liked this book.  There are parts of this book where the author could have revealed more.   The account of his nervous breakdown is scary, but all too brief, and on too many occasions - bouts of adolescent [activity], unsuccessful psychoanalysis, addiction to alcohol - Mr. Wakefield seems like a kid in a confessional.  He rushes through his sins in order to be unburdened, but also undiscovered.  It doesn't work.  If we give the penitent the benefit of our attention, he should give us the benefit of a compelling story 
 I was a charter subscriber to this magazine when it started up publication.  It was a breath of fresh air in a stagnant field of almost universally wretched photography magazines.  Over the years things changed.  Columnists died or moved on.  Editorial directions were switched.  Articles that once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers.  When digital photography became dominant in the marketplace, "Outdoor Photographer" was in the vanguard, pushing every gadget and Photoshop manipulation plug-in that popped up.  The magazine became a wasteland of promises of better pictures if you just buy _____ (fill in the blank with whatever the current trend might be).  What I thought was ironic at the time was that the best photographs they printed were being done by photographers using the least sophisticated equipment.  Photographers using film (!?), a lot of large format guys, occasionally some black and white and stuff made with cameras just about any serious hobbist already owned.  But these portfolios began to dwindle from occasional to rare to almost non-existent.  At some point, my interest in this garbage lapsed before my subscription.  The magazine made a once monthly trip from the mailbox to the trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it.  "Outdoor Photographer" impresses people who measure quality photography by whether or not the equipment used in production cost the equivalent of the gross national product of small third world countries.  It offers little in the way of nutrition to a hungry mind.  It's empty calories, just making you want more and more while starving your potential.  It truly is wretched.  
 i'll admit i havent even read the book. perhaps i will in the future, but a few incorrect "facts" fly out while just gazing over the material available online.  the most glaring is that "Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney was Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney's Aunt." get with it she was his mother, obvious she named her son after her father. anyone who has read either's biography would know that. and for other sources John Hay Whitney "JOCK" was his cousin not his brother 
 I happen to think the pictures in this book are beautiful.  I wish I could achieve the same level of competence with color.  By buying the book, I hoped to improve my ability to quickly make sound color choices, but try as I have, I just can't get the needed information from this book.  I have purchased quite a few books on painting, and some have really helped me.  The really frustrating thing is that it's obvious she knows what she's doing, but equally obvious she has a hard time communicating it.  If you already understood the topic, I'm sure you would get some comforting reassurance from seeing that which you have grasped reaffirmed.     If you are not already a good artist, it's pure misery to try and figure out what she is saying.  I have read every word and studied every picture in some cases 3 to 5 times, and I have taken little away.  I'm sure that if she were watching me paint, I would eventually understand what she is teaching, but I was not able to get much from the book.  I did enjoy looking at the pictures, but the text is pure torture 
  Warning: Stay away from this Terk SIR-EXT50 extension cable, I've had to purchase 3, thats right 3 cables in 20 months.After the 1st died (9 months) I brought it back to Best Buy for an exchange. Was told I must exchange with Terk. Returned to Terk by certified mail, never received response or exchange Terk does not back this product up. Went to Best Buy & purchesed another, died yesterday after only 10 months of use. Now I'm on my way to Radio Shack to try out the MONSTER sirius 50ft Extension Cable. Wish ME Luck 
 This book is the most ridiculous collection of foolishness which I have ever taken the time to read. I am appalled that Mr. Brown did not employ adequate resources to verify many of the allegations made in this book.  For example, I found it totally unacceptable that Mr. Brown alleged that three past U.S. Presidents were Freemasons, when they definitely are not.  Although this is quite an easy area in which to find proof, Mr. Brown calls Presidents Clinton, Carter and Reagan Freemasons, when none of them were so affiliated. I am persuaded to believe that he knew of these falsehoods when he wrote them, because whenever he mentions anyone who actually is a Mason, he is careful to mention which Masonic Lodge they were a part of ... not so with Clinton, Carter or Reagan, because NONE OF THEM WERE MASONS!  He also spent much of his time criticizing the Freemasons, which is obviously an organization that he doesn't understand. More specifically he miss-understands the fact that each Masonic lodge is independent and beholden only to it's own Grand Lodge, such that there would not be much if any cooperation or communication between the various Grand Lodges to the effect that you could get all Freemasons to "conspire" in any complicated effort.  He has obviously taken every negative rumor against Masonry to heart, and synthesized them into this book ... even though the book is not actually "about" Masonry.  It appears to me that Brown's real problem with Masonry is that it is not a "Christian" organization, which they don't purport to be, even though the majority of Masons are Christians.  The book is also garbage where he actual writing is concerned.  The number of times Mr. Brown uses the phrase "illuminati ruling class conspiracy," is sickening, and he makes up words like agentur(s), which he uses synonymously with the word "agent." Every person of any stature is an "agentur of the illuminati ruling class conspiracy" to Mr. Brown. This is the first book I have read which I have disliked to such a degree to write a bad review, and I would dissuade any person from reading this book who does not already have a basis in the reality of the subjects of which Mr. Brown speaks, or else knows when to go to Google or Wikipedia to double check the numerous false allegations or look up the words that this guy has created.  I was thoroughly disappointed, don't waste your time, this is one for the trash heap! 
 I didn't realize that this movie is basically all in German with english subtitles. Second, it is mostly about Erik Zabel. Yes, the scenary is nice and the music is good, but I wouldn't buy it again nor would i watch it again. 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 I will not waste time with a plot rehashing.       This book was a nouveux piece of trash.  I had the unfortunate experience of not only reading this book but being is Ms. Boyd's creative writing class at Connecticut College.  I feel the author garnishes attention toward her writing by attempting to  write outlandish plots...she conducted herclass the same  way...anything for attention, Blanch.  I am an avid reader of literature  and this book hardly qualifies.  Superficial it is.  If you would like to  read a good book revolving around the south, I recommend anyone of the  following, YaYa Sisterhood, New Orleander, Crazy Ladies, or Dorothy  Allison's work.  Do not waste your precious time reading these pointless  attempts at humor and life.        I would have given this negative stars  but I could not.      Most people are not amused by the brash, senseless,  and pathetic tone of this book.  As I said before, it hardly qualifies as  literature...maybe a 90's version of a Danielle Steel novel 
 I really really really really like Allison Moorer.  Have been a fan since her first record, have road-tripped to see her numerous times, and love her songwriting and singing.  That said -- "Getting Somewhere" is by far the least satisfying of her records.  No memorable songs.  Over-produced.  No "guts", as another reviewer said.  When the Allison Moorer/Doyle "Butch" Primm songwriting team called it quits (in more ways than one), their Lennon/McCartney-caliber teamwork was lost.  Not that Moorer sounds like The Beatles, but Allison and Butch complemented each other well when composing music.    This CD is not only unmemorable but I doubt I would care to ever listen to it again.  Such a shame.  I've never had anything negative to say about Allison in the 8 years I've been a fan.  But this CD left me cold.  It hurts a bit to say this, but I cannot recommend this CD.   The closest analogy I can think of that relates to how different this CD is from her earlier work is the B-story line from an episode of "The Larry Sanders Show".  In that episode, Sanders' head writer Phil (played by Wallace Langham) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy.  As a result he lost his edge.  When he was a miserable person he was an edgy, cynical, funny jokewriter.  When he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job.      Same with Moorer.  Since her recent changes in her social life she has started "singing a sweeter tune" in her life, but it came with a cost.  She doesn't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that "other" songwriter who was so good -- a little edgy, sad, sometimes bitter, or at least that's how I interpreted it.  Granted, that wasn't her entire oeuvre, but it is what made her songs special for me.  Now she's happy and she might as well be writing songs for Barney the Dinosaur 
 Healthy? I don't think so. Every meal she uses a lot of olive oil, butter, and salty additives. then writing a recepie for "Hamburger Salad" Basically garden greens from a bag, and a couple fried hamburger patties placed on top of the greens, with cheese on it. Oh my...Quick, easy and "Healthy" meals. I don't think so 
 I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable 
 This book is the only detailed guide to the Ventana wilderness.  It is very difficult to follow and you definitely sense that it has not been updated since 1987.  The topo maps in back are hard to read and you constantly have to flip back and forth to see where you are going.  I give it a 4 because it is the only book out there, but in terms of usability it is a 1. My advice:  buy the book and call the ranger station to get the skinny before heading out into the wilderness.  Also, I will definitely refrain from pointing out my favorite hiking destination...it is a jewel 
 The title of the book is attractive. That's why I purchased a copy.  Other than that, the book could be easily summarized on one page with a couple good suggestions.  Otherwise, it feels like a con-job, and a waste of money 
 I just purchased this book, and I was really excited when I received it.  However, after 5 attempts of trying to install the CD-ROM, I gave up, and... the worest thing is, I tried to visit the website the book provided, in order to get to contact with them & ask for help... I was not allowed to view the page... cuz they blocked a lot of IP address, and the cable company that I have is on their list.........   If you want to get a USEFUL CD-ROM for drug reference, don't get this book... it will cause you a lot of headache & troubles.  Get Nursing200X drug handbook published by Springhouse.  The software is good, and I never had any problem with it 
 Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does. 
 This is a good cookbook for the beginner chef.  Recipes are pretty straight forward if bland.  If you have any cooking experience, this cookbook will be a bit boring.  A great cookbook is the Bride & Groom First and Forever Cookbook.  Very tasty 
 Thankfully this book is not very long, so my disappointed is only so deep. It must be said that if Samuel Huntington did not write his "Clash of Civilizations", then this book would not have written or published. This is an attempt to argue Huntington's theory, which is fine, but in the wrong method. Entitled "Identity and Violence", Sen covers very little on Identity and even less on violence. Sen states that we all have multiple IDs. He then restates it. And then again. And then again with the added ideal that focusing on one ID is dangerous. He repeats this too many times.  What Sen fails to address, recognize or grasp is the concept of an Identity. What is it? Why do we have them? What influences IDs? What are the connections between ID and violence. What is violence? Why is it used? Why is it bad? Is violence bad? Just way too many questions about Identity and Violence are left unanswered, unaddressed, and avoided in a book called "Identity and Violence" 
  Oates is fond of taking iconic figures (Marilyn Monroe in Blonde) and watershed events in American history (Ted Kennedy's Chappaquiddick incident in Black Water; the Detroit riots in them) and novelising them. Usually Oates is dead-on in her re-workings of fact but in Blonde, she misses the mark. I know some people who read this long, stumbling book and liked it, but they were major fans of Monroe. Personally I found the story uninteresting, the message of tragedy and blame unworthy of the intricate genius of Oates, and the Marilyn of the novel less exploited and pre-programmed to failure, as Oates wished her to seem, and more of an annoying fool too hamstrung by her own inability to learn from mistakes to successfully manage her own ambitions. Joyce Carol Oates is still one of the greatest writers in American letters, but in Blonde she fails to deliver a work that meets her own lofty hopes for the ideas out of which it grew 
 Better just to throw it away rather than saddle someone with a mistake I made. Thank goodness, it was not costly...do not waste your money on this toy tuner...this tuner is not sensitive enough for any use at all..Cannot buy a worthwhile, more costly instrument? Go to Guitarplayersclub.com, a site Fender put up for ama and pro players alike....there is a tuner there, FREE that comes very close to the expensive one...Exception? No where to put your quarter..... 
                  As you can tell by the header, I was disappointed by this movie. Since Kurt Russell plays the lead, I should not have been surprised, because the parts he plays are generally rather predictable and simplistic (Tango & Cash, Snake Plisskin, etc). I just don't picture Kurt as lead actor in a gritty, realistic drama...but, eternally the optimist, I hoped that this might be the exception. It wasn't.  The story involves two LA detectives, one a grizzled and thoroughly corrupt veteran (Russell) and the other a somewhat principled but weak-willed and easily manipulated rookie, Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman). Russell's character (Eldon Perry) is controlled and protected by an exceedingly corrupt superior officer, Jack Van Meter (nicely played by Brendan Gleeson), who uses Perry to further his profitable and flagrantly illegal interests.   If you have ever watched "The Shield" on FX cable network then you will be familiar with this general setup....a morally ambiguous detective is used to further his superior's agenda.....but here is the problem: The Shield (a television series) is vastly superior in every way: plot, acting, characterization, dialog, direction, etc. to this feature film. It is like comparing filet mignon to cheap hamburger. Once you see a quality, nuanced drama like The Shield, this movie and all like it are rendered unwatchable.   Characters in Dark Blue are caricatures with almost no depth. They guzzle whiskey and laugh about their flagrant crimes. The plot and dialog are contrived and unrealistic. There is no subtlety....no intellectually stimulating complexity. Eldon always does exactly as he is told: if mass-murdering thugs (employed and protected by his superior) are to be sheltered from arrest, simply go out and murder a couple of stray ex-cons and let them take the rap (posthumously) for the real criminals. Never mind that neither of the ex-cons is even close to being a plausible suspect. No one would be fooled by this ruse, except perhaps in this mindless movie.   Eldon gets his partner Keough to perform one of the cold-blooded murders ordered by Van Meter, and thus begins their downfall, because Keough has a spontaneous change of heart and suddenly cannot accept the guilt of his actions. One minute he is guzzling whiskey with his cronies and laughing about lying to a shooting review board, and the next he is overwrought with guilt. Not at all likely in real life, but it suits the plot.   Things gets even sillier when the partner (Speedman) then teams up with the assistant chief's (Ving Rhames) predictably beautiful ex-mistress (Michael Michelle) to try to arrest the real thugs and use them to bring down the whole perverted mess. Heaven forbid that he simply come forth and provide evidence to accomplish this end. What follows is a lengthy, confused, and poorly choreographed pursuit of the thugs and a predictable gun battle with equally predictable outcome.   The ultimate farce, however, is reserved for Eldon himself, who drives around South Central Los Angeles during the peak of the Rodney King riots trying to find and arrest a black suspect....which he easily accomplishes....and then drives away without a scratch. This reaches the level of surrealistic absurdity and is an insult to the true horror of the riots.  Equally unconvincing is Eldon's spontaneous change of heart at the end of the movie, during his promotion ceremony (such irony), when he delivers a rambling, preposterous and unconvincing indictment of his father, himself, and his evil superior....which is simplistically and immediately accepted (in true movie fashion) by all who hear it, and who then immediately jump to arrest and condemn the naughty superior. This is silly, implausible, and an insult to any viewer above the age (and maturity) of a 10-year old. Jump up at your next promotion ceremony and deliver a rambling condemnation of your superior and see what happens. This type of naive nonsense occurs in only one place: the movies....bad ones.   If you were thrilled by Tango & Cash, and thought Snake Plissken was a brilliantly-portrayed anti-hero, then by all means hit the "Buy It Now" button for this DVD. But, if you want complexity, subtlety, realism, plausibility, and infinitely superior acting, plot, characterization, and direction....do yourself a huge favor and use your money to either subscribe to FX on cable, or buy/rent DVD's of The Shield series....filet mignon is always better than cheap hamburger 
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 This is not a good book for learning Java3D.  The author buries Java3D in so many layers of his own code that you can't even recognize it.  The one useful idea I got from the book was to not compile the scene graph so that I can add and delete objects from the scene during run time. Skip this book, the Java tutorial is better and its free 
 This book was a definite let down fo me. This book was good but not terrific. after reading best sellers like Why we want you to be rich by Donald TRump and God Doesn't run a $2 Shop by Sage Saint Francis i found that this book just was not in the same leauge. i mean those two books changed my life, and actually got me the result and financial freedom i was after but they are not for everyone. When Deepak started to explain the law of Karma it just struck me 'what [lant is he from!' we would all like to believe, and many do, just as i did, that the world has a 'scoring system', that it keeps count, and it rewards those and comes around to those accordingly...yeah right! Let me tell you if me and the Pope both stand outside in the rain we both get rained on! the world does not play favorites, and it does not discriminate. I am talking about that 'something' and the world does not discriminate people do! basically since i woke up from this idealistic rubbish, took off my rose coloured glasses, i began to actaully get the results i want. Just look at Princess Di, Steve Irwin and Martin Luthur King...what happened to Karma there!? This is badcially what the book is about, as if there are '7' laws...yeah right...Wayne Dyer says 10, the bible says 10...whats next? This just isn;t reality, it is subjective idealism... I do not feel this is the authors best work, however i still believe it is a good investment and a descent place to start 
 Having worked on Wall Street for 25 years, by and from experience I can assert that ANY economic behavior by any human does entail a marginal error toward/from the misinterpreted phrase "zero sum game.Simply research historic Federal Reserve monetary policy to understand this, let alone structured finance! Prof. Thurow's point is that the US political economy, its citizens, and those "elites" who make its policy are asymetrically informed. Sooner or later, the US has to restructure its misapplication of redistributing wealth; hence the shock of the 70's, the long-term mess Regan has left; the stock bubble of the mid-90's; the current housing bubble.  Another shock a la 1973 and 1978 might redirect this country's "elites'" thinking towards more long-term pragmatic lines 
 I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book.  The acting is okay. The settings are okay. The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste 
 This music is boring. All tangos have the same tempo. No milongas. What a shame! Trying to do routines to this music would be  a waste of time. This CD sounds like background music in a lounge. 
 The chocolate war  The chocolate war was one of the best books I have ever read...NOT! The chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene. The boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused, but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot. I would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate. I don't think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level. This story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out. I think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of Archie. Archie is a suspicious character that knows every one. I wish this book was more school appropriate, but it isn't and was a horrid book. Therefore, this book would be great if the author published a book with the Sam story but more school appropriate situations and words 
 I read the first two chapters, scanned the rest, and decided not to waste any more time; there are too many good books to read. The premise of the writer (de Becker) is that intuition is correct where rational thought fails. He tells the stories of the lady who was attacked in a dark parking lot, the lady whose boy died during an operation, and the one whose son was getting a lot of attention from a pervert. In every case the lady had reason to fear for her or her boy's safety before a bad thing happened. To de Becker, each tale is proof that intuition was right and reason went wrong. The author does not cite his sources, but makes it clear that he is the world's foremost consultant, and gets these stories from people who attend his lectures and TV appearances (on Oprah!). The book might be better if it was all stories, but it is padded out to 321 pages with a lot of hot air. It never happens that anyone is taken by surprise, or has an unfounded suspicion. Becker gives us a slanted, unbalanced view, in trying to ratify the bold claims on the book jacket (how to know if every person your child will ever meet is a threat). The evidence is cooked. The thesis must be rejected. I offer the alternate hypothesis that de Becker pads his pockets selling bogus books to gullible parents. 
 I found this book very exasperating indeed. While it may be a good referance work, the non-specialist would find it very difficult to read  full tilt like a novel. While detail can be a strength, in this book it  overwhelms the reader: the writer simply MUST cite every letter Einstein  wrote and every reply he received! It is a tedious exercise. The science is  dry, clinical and extremely difficult to follow. The writing (translation?)  is mediocre and the editing is even worse. Forget this book if you are  looking for a passionate, clear, focused and above all a readable account  of Einstein's life and thought. There must be better biographies around 
 Well, I just received Gavin Lambert's book on Natalie Wood, and after trudging through this monotonous, overblown biography, the conclusion is as follows: it's boring as hell!  (I can't say I haven't been warned). This is the "wonderful" biography of Natalie that is supposed to set the record straight?  It boasts 78 photos, but instead of being included in a glossy pictures section, they are widespread on various pages in the book so that they appear grainy.  It seems to me that it was written as a rebuttal, and to paint Lana Wood as a greedy, vicious person (she was obviously not interviewed), and to make childish slaps at her, when she was not given the opportunity to tell her side of it.   Robert Wagner seems threatened by anyone who knew Natalie before he, Lambert and Mart Crowley did - dismissing all of the people Natalie befriended before who offered their insights in "Natasha: The Biography Of Natalie Wood" as vultures who barely made her aquaintance and who are weaving fantasies about her.  Basically, Wagner is uncomfortable with the aspects of Natalie's life that he was not involved in.  It doesn't really attempt to get behind Natalie's persona any, like "Natasha" did, and of course, it doesn't acknowledge Natalie's love for Jimmy Williams, her first boyfriend, the rape by a famous actor, or what happened on the night of her death, hastily tying up loose ends and making her death sound so simple.  Lambert wrote this book for Wagner, there's no question, and Natasha and Courtney are hardly mentioned at all.  Did Lambert actually do any in-depth research?  As well, there are allegations that Nick Gurdin may not have been Natalie's or Lana's father, and then there's Natasha Lofft, who has not proven with DNA that she is actually Natalie's half sister, but Wagner and the girls have no problem believing that she is, but they dismiss Suzanne Finstad's book as speculation and trash? I'll believe this claimant's story when I see proof! At least Finstad was able to remain somewhat objective and unbiased, since she did not know Natalie (and she did try to get Wagner's input, but he refused) which is obviously not the case with this pathetic attempt at a so-called "definitive" biography. Much of the book appears to be written quickly, but at least it does name the film Natalie turned down, which was reputed to have the actor who raped her in the cast.  And of course, it has to dispel all the allegations of Wagner's sexual orientation, and what played the role in the demise of his first marriage to Natalie.  As much of a disappointment as this book is, I'm glad I purchased it so I can compare it to "Natasha" and Lana's book to try to decipher what is closer to the truth.  At least I didn't have to spend too much money on it!  Whatever the truth, I hope that Natalie is at peace. 
 This book reminds me of a false advertisement: pick it up and it sounds interesting, even those first crucial lines pull you in and then... Then we are pulled along on a tortuous journey into a writer's ego.  This book is written in the kind of style that you want to be beautiful, even lyrical - Instead it's more often confusing.  By page 17 I was skipping forward in hopes that it became more compelling.  There is a languid air to Mr. Jordan's writing, which is fine as long as we care about what happens or why.  Why the main character is killed by her childhood friend (no suprises, we know the killer's name on page one)is perhaps the clearest paragraph and half of the book. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until page 268, by then I was just glad to be done with it all.  Mr. Jordan's screenplays are wonderful, but this book is pure self-indulgence.  
 This book is very light for those who are engaged in Science of the Mind or Louise Hay's readings. It doesn't say anything new to what we already know. I wouldn't recommend buying it. 
 While the pictures in "The Jewel Box Garden" are great and may provide the reader with some inspiration, the author's condescending and judgemental text is pedestrian and fails to provide the reader with any original ideas regarding how to think about and plan a great place in a small space. 
 This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales 
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage 
 I was tricked into buying this Soundtrack because the label that keeps it sealed had "Ghost in the Shell Soundtrack."  The problem is that nonoe of the music from the "Stand Alone Complex" series is on it.  Most of the music is cheap techno, none of the good stuff from the series.  The songs are thankfully short, but only one is even worth listening to.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM 
 This is utter rot. Another stinker from the withered pen of MCall Smith. Plotless, overly peppered with Mr McCall Smith's book of quotations, up-tight, and worst of all - boring.  Mr McCall, don't give up the day job 
 A Child's Golden Book of Ayn Rand... Why in the world would someone take the time and trouble to publish a book without acquainting himself with the facts of his subject's life?  This book is a superficial, riddled with  errors and worthwhile only for the photos 
 It's pretty rich for Pat to write a book about the ten commandments when he doesn't even follow them himself. Last time I checked, "Thou shall not murder" was one of the big ten. 
 When I realized early on the time I would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept, I resolved that I would alert other readers.   Generally I enjoy this author's works and anticipated this latest tome. I was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it's clues or probable developments. Everything was telegraphed and nothing was original. The conclusion was so lame that I was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue.  My advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next 
 The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.   Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who Meredith is, and what she looks like.   Meanwhile, Princess Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry.   Jesus wept.   And for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope, she's just incognito, baby.   At which point I almost threw down the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels, including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually 
 Although I agree with much of what Ms. Seaman writes about synthetic estrogen, (made from mares' urine,) and progestin, (synthetic progesterone), I strongly disagree that all estrogen is potentially "dangerous" to the female body.  (Pls. see Dr. Uzzi Reiss's comments on bio-identical estrogen in his wonderful book, Natural Hormone Balance for Women, in which he, (Dr. Reiss), states: "Currently estrogen is "under attack" as a major risk factor in the epidemic of breast cancer.  I find this ludicrous.  Estrogen is the hormone that distinguishes women's unique gender.  After 2 million yrs. of human evolution, could the female hormone suddently have turned into a serial killer?  Would nature suddenly decide to create a one-gender species?  Of course not.  Incriminating estrogen is as logical as saying that your liver is the cause of liver cancer." (p. 28 of Dr. Reiss's book).  I thoroughly agree with Dr. Reiss.  I, (along with something like 70% of women in menopause), had terrible symptoms of insomnia, lack of energy, lethargic depression, muscle/joint pain, and minor anxiety.  It took me two yrs. of physical symptoms to finally discover bio-identical estrogen, and I consider it a "lifesaver."  It has literally given me back my sense of who I was before menopause.  Within 1-1/2 hrs. of taking the hormone, I became in control of my mind and mood again, regained my stamina, slept better than I had in 2 yrs., and within a few days started to lose the excess wt. I had gained. My recommendation is that in addition to Ms. Seaman's book, readers might like to read Dr. Reiss's book, (from a purely clinician point-of-view,), rather than just a political one. Hooray for Tri-Est!! (name of the bio-identical estrogen formula I used).    
 I was extremely disappointed by this book/pamphlet, being misled by the other favorable reviews.  It is completely lacking in information.  It has 51 6"x8" pages with huge font and too many cartoons.  It successfully defines what is good and bad posture, but does not provide excercises to improve it (it simply states to "practice" good posture).  There are much much better alternatives.  I have read "Posture Alignment" and recommend that, and have heard of great reviews for "Posture, Get It Straight!" 
 This was a mess. This movie gave me the feeling that I was was watching a really bad made for tv film. I was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was. Everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. Viggo Mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan. All in all, this film was predictable, formulaic and a bore. Please save your money for something worthwhile 
 This has the potential to be a great toy.  There are two squeakers that make two different sounds, and also some crinkly stuffing in part of the dog.  However, in less than an hour, my dog was ripping the stuffing out, and that was after I had amputated the chewed up ears and tail.  Even though I bought his on sale, these things cost too much to last less than a day 
 I have read three books on the subject and this was the worst.  There is very little info in big type on this books 130 pages.  The interview questions are basic and there aren't many of them.  All these books are over priced but this one is the worst I have seen 
 Your web-page is misleading.  It quotes, and the image displays, the Middle English original of the poem. The inside pages shown are from the Middle English edition.  However, (and the modernized title should be a giveaway, but it wasn't) the edition on this page is in modern English -- a translation, not Chaucer's poem.  You need to clean up this page, take away the Middle English quotations, state that it's a modern translation, and refer the prospective buyer to the actual, modernized edition -- which the buyer may or may not want (in my case I did not), with assistance in finding the actual Middle English masterpiece 
 If you're planning not to buy a book, this is just the book. A well-to-do Brooklynite suffering from post-bourgeois angst (sometimes called idealism) moves to Vermont (does this storyline sound familiar?!?) to live simply and be a minimalist, something literally thousands, if not millions of other people have done (indeed are doing), except she decides to write a book about it. I'm not sure I quite I understand the splendidly ironic, oxymoronical (if not hypocritical) logic of consuming anti-consumption, but hey, there seems to be quite the market for it 
 You get a view into 60's white america. The only people of color in this book are a policeman, and a caricature. I don't have a problem with other Seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe. This is set in everyday life, and I think its best left on the bookshelf, it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair, not to mention various shades of skin colour. The rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one-dimensional "white" depiction of the world 
 I am a huge Tananarive Due fan---My Soul to Keep is one of my favorite books and The Living Blood is not far behind.  So it pains me to say just how disappointed I was with Joplin's Ghost.  It is clear that Ms. Due has given up her true voice to keep up with urban drivel that has, for some unknown reason, become so popular as of late.  Joplin's is an easy read--which is not a good thing, as it lacks the dimension and coplexity of her previous works.  The Joplin piece was interesting but the rest of the story tries to be hip and falls way short of the mark. I hope that Ms. Due finds her way back to her voice. 
 Knowing Gods word and that he changes not for our sakes I really really felt that this book at some point can be very misleading against Gods word even against Jesus teachings and instructions which he laid for us all saved or not yet as of saved Jesus love teaches that God loves everyone and that he pleads with us to come to him with our problems and give him our short comings and ask him for forgiveness when we sin against our own souls and against the father however this book Echoes of the souls states that if you don't get it right the first time in this life then guess what you can take care of it in the next life time as if God has granted us not just 9 lives but several which is totally against Gods word the Bible Say's that it has been appointed once for man to die. THE FATHER also lets thoes who hear his voice and even those who disobey his voice know right off that he sends false Prophets / Psychics  to test our love and loyalty to him please read Deuteronomy 13.( I AM NOT CALLING THE WRITTER A FALSE ANYTHING I JUST DO NOT AGREE WITH THE THINGS SHE WROTE) The Bible also says to test the spirit weather if it is actually from God or Not,  The thought of believeing in a reward for good behaviour is one thing we should all hope for but the thought of being rewarded with Good for hatred behaviour and murder, and sexual immorality and child molestation, Pediphila,adultry, Satanism etc . .  ROMANS 1:22 - 32 without true repentance and forgiveness is rediculous the book suggest that you will receive as many lives as you need in order to complete what is already been put inside of each soul sence the worlds ever exsisted  COMMON COURTESY AND RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER AND LOVE AND NOT TO LEAVE THIS EARTH WITHOUT KNOWING AND ACCEPTING THE TRUE SACRAFICE FOR OUR SINS WHICH IS JESUS OUR LORD, SAVIOUR, AND OUR BROTHER   The Bible says there are vessels of good and vessels of evil and vessels that God created for destruction How do you get your people to repent ? Make an example out of thoes who would not listen to you HELL IS REAL and you have but one chance to get it right he is God and he can do whatever he feels will get his point a cross for those who hvae embraced this book and live life FAST and Corrupt and IMMORAL and do not believe in a Hell this scripture is for you LUKE 16:19 this man begged to have a second chance just to atleast go back and warn his brothers which was not granted to him he went to HELL Period and was able to see paradise from HELL which made his torment worse.  For thoes who believe in a heaven and a Hell but fully agree with the contents of this book this scripture is for you GALATIONS 1:6 - 9  For thoes who are strongly wondering why would God or Jesus allow such revelations from this book these scriptures are for you DEUTORONOMY 13:1 -  and LUKE 22:31 Satan has the right to test your loyalty to the Father God to see if you are a child of God or of something else in nature. If you are a child of God you will make mistakes on a dailey basis trust me but you will also grow and learn and excel above your mistake and will have your sins forgiven in Jesus name and will be called a Child of God  This book attempts to explain Homosexuality and lesbianism as follows  A Boy soul can end up in a Female Human body and a female soul can end up in a boy human body   I look at it this way either you believe in God or you Do not GOD DOESNT MAKE MISTAKES LIKE THAT HE IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY  HE CREATED THE SOUL AND GAVE IT A BODY AND THE SOUL AND BODY A LIVING SPIRIT and given FREE WILL The best gift of love God gives all of his Children is the will to love him or reject him this is the right to choose  Now I am not saying that a young man cannot develope at some point more female traits in him then male I must go back to genetic with this one which is the fact that during ovulation there are 2 eggs released in a womans body not one remember in the Bible ADAM saw that each beast had a mate and after realizing that God put him to sleep and created WOMAN in so doing I believe that the woman of those days to quickly populate the earth had the ability to produce in every birth TWINS  In the situation of a man having more female traits then Male is simple in a single birth the contents of the second child in early stages of uteral in some cases are consumed in the 1st childs genetic code therefore the child is left feeling more female then male and grows up being put down for it NOT THE CHILDS FAULT AT ALL But here is a SCRIPTURE EVEN FOR YOU  EXODUS 15:25  HEAVEN IS A PREPARED PLACE FOR A PREPARED PEOPLE.  And with that said I leave this  Romans 12:1 - 
 The CD mistakes are unforgiveable.  I would say until they release a completed downloadable examples of entirely workable examples DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!  I did visit the errata site and followed a few of their examples on how to build things.  Got a couple of things to build, but when exploring the world in the example of chapter 15, there are bugs and holes in the display or render errors or something.  Or maybe this is the way that it was engineered.  I think when they provide proper support for this book I will probably give this book 4 stars, because I think it is well written and goes over the topic of Game Engine programming very well.  Too bad they did such a poor job of quality control.      
 This book is an insult. Sure, there are some facts about this television series, but the book seems directed at people whose IQ would never permit them to understand what is going on on-screen. The print is large with huge margins and wide spaces between lines of print. Had they printed it in regular format, the 300 pages could have neem accomodated in 200, which seems a blessing when one thinks of wasted trees. The language is on a 6th-grade level. This is bad enough, but why didn't the publishers provide even minimal proof-reading services? The book is chock-full of typos and grammatical errors that would embarrass anyone. There are even sentences that simply stop in the middle and hang there on the page looking like a bloody limb hanging off one of the palm trees on the beach of the survivors' island.  This book is a true embarrassment and shame. The writing is all right - no better - but the quality control is simply non-existent. How can anyone be this uncaring?  There are other Lost books on the market. Any of them would be better than this one 
 I'm not Christian. I'm Agnostic and I picked up the book because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to learn something about Christianity.  This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. Let me be clear that I am saying nothing against religion in this review. I cant judge that, but I can review this terrible writing. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to have no concept of motivation, logic, or storytelling. It's as if when writing the book they had ideas of where the characters should end up, but then used the first idea that popped into their heads about how that should happen with no critical thought at all.   As stated before, the names of the characters should have given me pause, the most egregous being Chang Wong, a name so stereotyped that I cant believe the authors have ever met an Asian. At this book in the series the world has devolved into a right wing nutjob survivalist fantasy, where the TribForce(...) is living literally underground, in rebellion against the New World Order(who call themselves, wait for it: the New World Order).   The final battle of the Apocalypse is fought on ATV's and horses.  Jesus. 
 I usually enjoy James Pattersons' Alex Cross stories. I am not a die-hard fan, but I have always found myself entertained when reading most of the previous novels. But London Bridges hit rock bottom almost from the very beginning.  The story is made from the same formula the past 3-4 Cross-stories has been, and you can almost guess what will happen in the super-short chapters.  First we are inside the mind of one or more of the villains while they commit some gruesome crime, and the plotline is laid out. Then Dr Cross enters the stage, usually semi-depressed over something in his private life, a condition not made any better by the crime he is called in to solve, again usually with a bunch of colleagues, who can be detectives or federal agents, depending on where you are in the series. This time he is upset because of his youngest son, who lives with his mother in Seattle, a long way from Washington DC, where Cross resides with his older kids and his grandmother. Cross is also upset because he has to break up a date with his girlfriend Jamilla, a detective living in San Francisco, in order to get to the scene of this novels 'basic' crime.  This time the villain The Wolf has blown a trailerpark community off the face of the earth, and threatens to do the same to some of the world's major cities, if he is not paid a gazillion dollars and if some political prisoners are not set free. A deadline is given, the clock is ticking and Cross travels from America to Europe and back again and then to Europe and then to USA again within a week or so, in order to catch The Wolf and his fellow thugs, each of the thugs acting out their piece of The Wolf's big puzzle and way to world dominion.  The last 10 pages are utterly confusing, there is no tail nor head, the story seems to be all over the place, and at last you really could not care less if Cross and his whole family will actually survive the ordeals.  This book is not recommend for anyone excpet die hard Patterson/Cross fans. It does not live up to the expectations, but if Patterson can write 5-6 novels a year, then maybe there is an explanation for this book's lacking in quality 
 While slogging through some 450 pages of "Metropolis", the reader may wonder exactly what Elizabeth Gaffney is trying to convey in this plodding saga of post-Civil War New York City.  At its core, it is the tale of a young German immigrant on the lam after being framed in the arson of P.T. Barnum's American Museum.  He soon finds himself in the throws of the "Whyos", a secret Irish gang of New York's infamous Five Points, through which he finds work first on a road crew, later as a sewer man of New York's famed subterranean maze, and finally as a member of the construction crew building the Brooklyn Bridge.  Such ambitious fare certainly holds much promise for the historical novel fan, but Gaffney clutters the plot and the history with a ham handed dose of feminism and related social topics.  To make matters worse, the utopian Whyos who, we are to believe, have maintained their stealth and secrecy by communicating through a complex language of song.  While Gaffney portrays the Whyos as tough and ruthless, these ludicrous singing bandits seem closer to "The West Side Story" than to "The Gangs of New York."  Our young German hero - let's call him Frank Harris - the last of his several aliases - falls in love with the redoubtable Beatrice: pickpocket, whore, sometime murderer, and mol of the Whyos boss.  But in Gaffney's New York, girls like Beatrice are the salt of society, the true brains and fabric of both legal and illegal New York, held back only by men and the puritanical Victorian social mores of the day.   The book could have survived all of this, were it not for Gaffney's total lack of atmosphere, suspense, or pace in the story.  Fires, explosions, murders, are conveyed with the drama of a Brooklyn Bridge machinery technical manual, and while despite endless pages describing the thoughts and feeling of Frank and Beatrice, they stir as much inspiration as a trip with Gaffney through New York's sewers.  From the breathless praise lavished by Publishers Weekly, Booklist, and others, "Metropolis" was a novel I was really looking forward to devouring.  It is unfortunate that this book was so well received critically, but I suspect the reviewers were more enthralled with Gaffney's oh-so politically correct social commentary than in any true literary or entertainment talent.  Boring, disjointed, and unfocused, in the final analysis "Metropolis" is a good book to leave on the trolley. 
 I read this book because it won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1983.  It is, I believe, the least intersting and most esoteric book I have ever read.  It reminded me of my reading of Fin-de-Siecle Vienna, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1981, and which I long wanted to read and then when I read it I found it a chore to read, and greatly welcomed the last page.  The last chapter of Transformation made no sense for me at all, and reading this book's only significance is that I have read another Pulitzer Prize winner in history.  I thought I should warn persons who might be overly influenced by the other 3 reviews and might think this would be a great book to read 
 The author frequently uses illogical unsupported and misleading arguments. I simply felt that she was working far over her head and was not familier enough with the related subjects such as magic, alchemy and history to be  writing about it. The book is full of misconceptions and poor logic and is  simply not appropriate for new students. If your looking for a good Jungian  Tarot book, look at Lee Irwin's Gnostic Tarot. Much much bette 
 I bought an Extreme Card for my G4 from ameris and it was faulty didn't load and wouldn't let the computer come on.  Sent a note on the feedback and didn't get any response.  Looks like I will have to eat the card and the cost.  Not very happy with the vendor that amazon let sell the product on their site 
  this is the first book i didn't finsh in a very longtime. in general i like patterson but this book just tanked. very fast read but it just too far fetched 
 The Ediacaran fossils are an interesting chapter in the history of life. They are also an interesting chapter in "The Garden Of Ediacara." Unfortunately, this book appears to have more material in it about Mark McMenamin than it does about the subject matter. Is it truly necessary to show a photograph of a hotel in Namibia or the author's official Mexican fieldwork badge in order to discuss the first complex life forms? I don't think so. The reader truly has to pick and choose what paragraphs to read in order to learn about Ediacaran fossils as opposed to the author's travelogues. Much of the material is simply extraneous. Proper editing would have made this book much more interesting and pleasurable 
 Mikhail Bakunin is often called the father of anarchism. To say the father of a theory, based on pure unrestricted freedom, is a man who has no belief but in socialism and the necessity to tear down religion/faith brings shame to anarchism. Many great quotes and thoughts can be taken from this book; on the other hand a multitude of delusion can be taken as well. To have the freedom of faith, to live as you choose; that is anarchism in its purest form. Bakunin's main attack against god(s) is their usefulness to the ruling party. A party that rules will pervert anything to keep that rule. So should a party use the name of anarchism, is that to say Anarchism is a tyrannical theory? Anarchism, faith, and religion are but words. The intention behind the belief is where a man should look. In Bakunin's world we would not have religion, or faith; we would not own property; we would work for the good of the whole at the expense of the individual. Our world would enter an atheistic priesthood, forfeit of all individual rights. Tyranny wears many masks. Bakunin's anarchy, his socialism, is nothing more than control. The greatest oppression an anarchist can ever force upon his/her person, is the belief that anarchism and socialism go hand in hand. In every theory, in every great thought for freedom, there will always be those who pervert a name, a word, a doctrine. I recommend this book as an example of such perversion 
 People of all groups, ethnicities, religions, and races commit cons, steal, and such.  To paint a whole ethnic group, Gypsies (Romani folk) with the same broad brush as the few among them who commit crimes is no more valid than to call all whites "oven tenders" because of the Holocaust or call all corporate officers "embezzlers" because of Enron or to call all men as rapists because a few have done so.  These sorry characterizations merely illustrate how twisted the slanderer's own views are.    While the grain of truth is that some people of all groups might con other people, the larger truth is that all groups have their share of criminals and no group has a monopoly on virtue.    Marlock clearly has written a book that is quite racist and wrong in spite of the grain of truth that some few people are indeed criminals.    Marlock tries to cover his tail by saying that he does not mean "all" Romani folk but then he goes on to make it quite clear that means "virtually all" but can't say so, without legal liability issues.  It's pure CYA and then he goes on and on with his racist slanders.    Yes, cons do exist and this book describes many of them.  No, they are not "Gypsy crimes" but just crimes and are committed by people of all ethnicities.  Too bad he doesn't just stick to describing the crimes and never mind discussing his racial hatreds.  Marlock's agenda is clear.  If he only wanted to protect innocents from crimes, he would not focus on a single very-small group of people.  The number of Romani people in this world is miniscule compared to the number of criminals in the world so his focus on Gypsies illustrates his true agenda here is merely to demonize a tiny, relatively-defenseless group of people.  The Furer's Reichspropagandaleiter Minister Dr. Goebbels would be proud of Marlock as one of their own, I am sure.  
 First of all, I did not exactly 'read' this biography. Instead I purchased the CD version which I distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (I have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way, and still been able to read many more technology related books).  I had great expectations from this book, having recently enjoyed three biographies of Lincoln. I have to confess that I was sorely disapointed. I found the research of Mr McCullough to lack the kind of details that I have enjoyed in biographies from Walter Isaacson, Richard Carwardine, or Doris Goodwin. I do not seek a beautiful story in a biography, but rather a reliable source of facts that I can use to form my own opinion of a character. In this context, I find Mr McCullough's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of John Adams and his contribution to America. I also enjoy direct quotes from letters, speaches, autobiographies, as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period, the relationships to contemporary characters, ...) surounding a promonent figure. Usage of the English language in politics has dramatically evolved since Mr Adams' time, and I missed 'hearing' the voice of John Adams. Instead, this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author. Finally, having read other biographies of the founding fathers, I was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between Adams and Franklin.  All in all, my lasting impression is that Mr McCullough did a great job at bringing John Adams and the early American Revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions. Had I known that, I might have passed on this biography and instead explore Mr McCullough's fictional work 
 Danielewski is a little like "musician" Puff Daddy: he really does very little work on his own but is an expert at appropriating ideas from the avant-garde and then rearranging them in a comfortable, easily consumable form. "House of Leaves" has more in common with Stephen King than it does with Ballard, Burroughs, Poe, or even more radical artists who use the methods MD steals, like Samuel R. Delaney.  If having to turn a book while you read seems "cutting edge" or "daring" to you, then jump in. Otherwise, you should go buy some Jeff Vandermeer of China Mieville -- two artists less concerned with empty stylistic tricks and more focused on producing quality literature 
 Don't be fooled by the perfect cut of the countries on the box cover. I bought this for my [...] thinking the pieces were actually in the shape of the countries and it would be a good learning tool. Not quite. Some were. Most were not. Some countries were so small they were difficult to read. This will be in our next garage sale. Springbok puzzles are still the best 
 Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. 
 With all respect due to perhaps the greatest pistoleer the world has ever known, McGivern's book is long on promises and short on tutelage. Somewhere between the author's hyperbole and self-aggrandizing speech, I looked for a tidbit or two of useful, instructional information but found none. In short, McGivern comes across as a blowhard, one who has nothing to offer the reader in terms of advice on shooting. Skip this book---your time would be better spent on the shooting range 
   Sorry, but I am so tierd of the hype that Peter Jackson's new King Kong movie is doing lately that Ifound this new book (a so called sequal to the 1933 movie) so tedious and so unwanted that I threw my copy away.  Skull Island was destroyed in SON OF KONG, we will never  know the full truth of who built the great wall, why was the island populated by dinosaurs, or how Kong grew to the size that he did.  He was killed, his son died while saving Carl Denhemm at the movie's climax, and Skull Island was destroyed.  We are left with a mystery, and mystery is what makes the two movies as interesting as they are, we need not have everything explained to us.  Tell that to Jackson and the geeks who wrote this junk book 
 Reading the reviews for this book I thought it would be a more substantial book than what I found.  It is a cute idea, but it is lacking in content.  Very disappointed...will probably end up as a garage sale book 
 Good overview if you're using Microsoft encoder.  Lacks depth in specifications, technical issues, etc 
 I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life.  I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined. 
 Heed the bad reviews. I think the problem may be Medela's definition of "occasional use." I used this pump about once every other day or two for a month and a half--and apparently that is deemed more than occasional, because the pump yields very little now... about half of what it used to. So this is yet another review that leads to the same conclusion: I should have gotten a different pump 
 I bought this book because others had written how it was so much more comprehensive than the first edition. Unfortunately, David Keirsey appears to have fallen prey to the ego-elevating practice of creating his own labels for established concepts without adding information to those concepts.   Specifically, I was particularly annoyed by his tunnel-vision regarding the meanings of the Myers-Briggs letters. Most people already understand that extroverted and introverted characteristics have to do with social interactions. To label them expressive and reserved, respectively, seems unnecessary.   Although "sensory" could use some clarification, naming it "observant" seems to negate the intuitive person's ability to observe the feelings underneath feelings in others. Calling an intuitive person "introspective" also seems to serve this purpose, although the full description in the back of the book clarifies this somewhat.   In addition, naming "thinking" people "tough-minded" seems to place a negative connotation on this characteristic, which seems to support Mr. Keirsey's own complaint that people see those who have a greater tendency toward paying attention to their thoughts than their feelings as "heartless" (page 334). Then he labels "feeling" people as "friendly," which is a better descriptor of social interactions (i.e., extroversion or introversion) than the internal processes of thinking and feeling. Friendliness would also only be apparent in those labeled extroverted.   Finally, even though Mr. Keirsey complained that Myers' descriptions of "judging" and "perceiving" focused on only one aspect of these letters, he proceeded to do the same thing, only in a different direction, by labeling them "scheduling" and "probing." These terms are no more comprehensive than the original ones, and I find it arrogant of Mr. Keirsey to decide for Myers what her terms meant.   Personally, I believe Mr. Keirsey did a better job in his first book regarding these descriptions, which are the foundation for everything else discussed in the book 
 SHARP AND INSIGHTFUL.  A VERY SATISFYING LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF SECRECY THAT PREVAILS AT THE BUSH WHITEHOUSE 
 This book misses the mark. I am a survivor of trauma with years of recovery behind me. This book takes a tough love approach, constantly reminding the reader of his/her limitations and can't say enough about how those limitations may never be healed to his/her desire. The correlation of survivors to Frankenstein's monster is a pity. I get the analogy, but couldn't the author come up with something other than the truely heinous? I would rather recommend "Legacy of the Heart" by Wayne Miller--a much gentler and realistic approach to healing trust 
 Really Really boring, don't think anyone should waste their time reading this garbage.  Horrible 
 This book covers little ground. The author extends comic relief constantly, which gets extremely annoying. Many books on this subject are much better 
 I ordered this pan even though i had never heard about this brand before.But the picture on the site and the product review looked good.When i recieved this item the lid that was promised was not shipped.The pan looked worn out and it looked factory refurbished.I returned the pan today and i promised myself that this is the last time i order brands that i have never heard about through the internet.Its better to stick to brands like faberware and calphalon which have not caused me any problems earlier and have lasted for such a long time 
 This book should never have been put together.  Many of the works are butchered.  Sometimes not even the original title is included and it seems that authors are missing from several as well.  He even butchers Aesops fables -- guess he doesn't want to overtax young minds with the full versions in all their splendor.  Of course, many of the selections are classics, but what he's edited out leaves me not only cold but disgusted.  If your kids internallize some of the slop used to demonstate these virtues, it will be hard to erase a number of pernitious misconceptions later 
 Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this thing like I did.  It's not worth reading.  The coverage of the API is incomplete, to put it nicely, and the explanations are convoluted and confusing.  Not worth the money at all 
 I have been an interested student of the Mountain Meadows Massacre for a lifetime.  First I was provided the views that were incumbent to my being raised in Utah but, not being completely satisfied with what I was taught and, to a considerable degree, being firmly encouraged to let sleeping dogs lie, I have made a careful study of everything that I could put my hands on regarding this most lamentable event in Utah history. Accordingly, I was eager to study AMERICAN MASSACRE by Sally Denton.  As I read, it was difficult not to see the immense chip that Ms. Denton apparently carries on her shoulder regarding, not only the events in question, but also Brigham Young and his supposed consummate evil.  Like UNDER THE BANNER OF HEAVEN by Jon Krakauer, MASSACRE seems to have at its foundation a marked departure from the professional and noteworthy journalism that characterizes past work by Ms. Denton.  One need not look too far to see the problems here.  Page after page of this work includes quoted statements by supposed witnesses and historians on the subject.  But interestingly, we are seldom told whom the noteworthy party was who brought such damning evidence forward.  Seemingly Denton had the information.  Why not note the names of authors in footnoting and endnoting techniques to which she surely must have been introduced in her earliest training in the English language?  And while I do not assume to believe that Brigham Young, or any of his contemporaries, was perfect and infallible at this time in history I can, at least attempt to put things in proper perspective (something that seems to completely elude Ms. Denton in her research and composition).  Consider it. With the largest force in US Military history, up until that time, on its way to Utah, with individuals -- both inside and outside of Utah -- breathing out threats of renewed violence and having suffered persecution and efforts at extermination during the decades prior to fleeing west, one can at least understand how, in a state of rampant panic and anxiety, the fuse on the would be powder keg was ignited and burning furiously.  Were mistakes made--even by the inimitable Brigham Young--as to how things were handled?  Most certainly.  Was execution of the immigrants by Mormon citizens the only alternative? Surely not! If cooler heads had prevailed, would the outcome have been markedly different.  Absolutely.  If cooler heads had prevailed! As I read allegation after allegation by Ms. Denton against the Mormon citizenry collectively and Brigham Young individually, I found myself asking, "Why, if Brigham was the Blackbeard of the Great Basin and his brainwashed Saints his loyal cutthroats, were there not more episodes like Mountain Meadows?  The vast empire of Deseret ranged through the whole of Nevada, up to Canada, down to Mexico and into Southern California.  Mormon settlements dotted the landscape in proximity to most of the best established roads west and, yet, Brigham's land pirates struck only at Mountain Meadows. A conundrum of the first order!  I was also intrigued by Ms. Denton's tendency to label anyone at the time who was inclined to support the Mormon position (Thomas L. Kane, Governor Alfred Cumming, etc.) as an absolute idiot.  On the flip side of things, were the immigrants, as Ms. Denton would seemingly have us believe, as noble, pure, innocent and benign as the very thoughts of God?  There may be some slight margin for debate here, but the last time I looked there was only one perfect person who ever lived on this earth and He certainly hailed from points farther east than Arkansas.  What emerges here is the rankest form of revisionist history possible, with Ms. Denton trickling a historical point here and there followed by barrage after barrage of her own pettiness and bile in trying to sell her point of view.  Unfounded assumption after unfounded assumption attempts to convince the reader that, somewhere, somehow, Ms. Denton commandeered a time machine and gathered information first hand.  Besides, how on earth does one expect to unravel things in a case that, in its day, took over twenty years to prosecute?  Certainly not in 243 considerably biased pages!  In the end, Denton's own statement, found at the top of page 133 of the hardback printing of this book, completely defines this work: "... mired in a lack of solid evidence."  I can't sum things up any more eloquently than that.  THE HORSEMAN

 I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesn't work.  This stuff is junk.  In addition, the manufacturer never sent the rebate.  Don't buy anything from Velocity 
 Shortly after I got this product, the thermostat in the Max Heat option blew out.  So, I can only use the Min Heat option (only 2 options) and it will stay on for days - no problem.  This is obviously too bulkly to easily ship back to Amazon - and I didn't keep the huge cardboard box that covered the manuf. box.  Wouldn't do it again for that reason

 For those of you looking for more Eva action after seeing the original series take heed. DON'T BUY THIS DVD! The Death part of the DVD, part 1, is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season, and the second half, Rebirth, part 2, is new stuff, very good, BUT! If you buy 'The End of Evangelion' you get Rebirth AND a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material. So, don't buy 'Death&Rebirth'. Buy 'The End of Evangelion' instead 
 When the truth about 911 is known he must not escape justice. He is a criminal and must be treated like one. Christian Peper  
 This is a text book. It does not cover any area of building fully.  There is a review section and review questions at the end of each chapter.  If your looking for a text book I'm sure it's OK.  I need a how to book and this was not it 
 To say that I've wanted to throw this *smartdeck* out of my car window countless times may be a strong indication of how poorly it works.   Never have I encountered a product that works so poorly. Don't even CONSIDER owning this accessory if you live in an area of the country that dips below 60 degrees; it seems the product works even worse in the cold!  Upon pluggin my iPod into the smartdeck, the adapter makes my iPod jump, from song to song, playing the first 1/2 a second of each. It's rare that I'm able to get the adapter to play the iPod normally.  I will no doubt be shopping around the competition for a stronger, more reliable piece of equipment for my iPod 
 Reviewer Joel (CA United States) is 100% correct: This book's description and all of the other reviews are completely misleading. The book is thin on content at this price range and doesn't even truly cover the subject of "Placing Shadows", and, other then building off of a foundation of the standard 3 point lighting system, it doesn't provide any techniques to do anything with shadows at all.  What it does provide is a good easily understood explanation of color and the measurable aspect of temperature along with definitions of the various existing light bulbs, their properties and color temperatures. But if you are at the stage where you're looking to buy a book to help you with using shadows then you should already know everything this book has to offer on this subject. And if not this isn't the book to get it from.  This book is not what I thought it would be as I was expecting some advanced knowledge on creatively using lights to create shadows that would enhance my productions. What I got was a rehash of the basics of illuminating a subject, with illumination as the key word.  If you want to learn lighting for video go get one of the lesser costing setup books that have page after page of diagrams of different sets and the various positions of where the lights should go.  This is not the book to help you learn about using shadow techniques to enhance your production as it is more a book about light bulbs and their color temperatures.  Oh, yeah, the second edition's cover is completely different and looks like a cheeply produced self published paperback book.   Now I have only one question: Where do I get a refund 
 This is a difficult book to evaluate. Its author is obviously a bright scholar, and the book itself comes from an invited memorial lecture at the Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in 1989. There is lots of good material here about 2nd Century Christian beliefs, and quotations from many sources that can be hard to track down.  BUT, it is difficult to know what the author is up to. There is no apparent structure nor theme. He seems to jump from one topic to another with no segue. Each pericope is perfectly good by itself, but there is no cumulative effect. Even more problematic, the documentation is poor and the bibliography is incomplete.  This book may have made a very good lecture, but it doesn't survive as a meaningful book. Nonetheless the material herein is very valuable and the book may be of interest to scholars of early Christianity who are interested in the works of Marcion, Valentinus, Ignatius, Irenaeus, etc. 
 Gee - sorry to those who like this modern recording but I like the 1951 recording the best.I have both the LP which is quite scratched by now and the CD which is quite good except for the pauses between tracks. I recommend the 1951 version available from Amazon (or at least it was in 2001) 
 This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history 
 .... and a little mouse is born. A flaccid bladder of utter banality inflated by the hot air of middle-brow legalism and obscurantist prose. No exploration of any depth or detail is carried out of the disruption wrought by a market-dependent way of life on the ecological, anthropological, cultural, social, political and psychological fibres that hold together the world's various societies, or on the fragility and volatility of the global market itself, which, of course, is portrayed as a fait accompli. Thus there is simply no contextual platform for the author's analysis, and, despite the standard air of portent, no clear picture of what law and militarism can or might actually do in the near future, and we are left non the wiser about what the course of history might actually BE. This work is fairly indicative of the mainstream American understanding of history; my advice is that they take a break from making it, or we are all in big trouble 
 The product description should say that the pan is a "mini" popover pan- not a full sized one.  It came with packaging that said so but I was unaware based on the description when I ordered.  I should have read the reviews 
 I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.  This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
 i went on a "read 'em all" thing a while ago.  the plot is an importaint issue in today's society but it is really dense and has so many abreviations and  appendices that i thought my head would explode. i feel it would be more intereresting to  listen to Pat Collins. Channel 4 news.  i understand that people outside the maryland virginia dc area would have no idea who he is but he talks in a monotone.  i understand that there are people who enjoy Crichton may be offended but i feel that it is true.  i read medical novels all the time and this is the most lethal of them all.   thank you for you time  yours truely  Kruphnehdahpheweundikaniswalyniaphorganopop  
 I have not read this book and I do not plan to. If I had followed the "medical model" I would be on a plethora of prescriptions now that would only serve to mask the symptoms, rather than address the cause. Instead, I chose to educate myself and get to the cause of my health problems. In my case, the cause of my arthritis was cows milk and wheat. Since the elimination of these two foods, my arthritis is gone and my digestion has improved immensely. I am not in the business to make money off supplements. In fact, I am an RN with a master's degree currently enrolled in the nurse practitioner program. In other words, I am not "biased" against the medical model. I also am a nutritional consultant and I have earned a doctorate degree from Clayton College of Nutrition. My main objective in pursuing these alternative programs was to educate myself, not to make money off others. However, when I start my practice as an ARNP, I plan to do everything I can to direct my patients toward healthier lifestyles and to motivate them to become active participants with regard to seeking the root cause of their health care issues. It is my belief that too many practitioners strictly follow the medical model with no consideration of their patients' ability to take responsibility for their health. 
 P...WHAT WAS YOU THINKING???? 
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 Very diappointing for purpose of home decor color inspiration; color quality pale, boring, nothing very interesting.  Not the book for me 
 Basically I just want to say that i totally agree with the review below mine.  The story plods clumsily on like a malformed clubfoot, and the prose is dead (it reminded me of a rather depressing hybrid of Kafka and  Hemingway: two sleep-inducers).  Anyhow if i see Norman around i am gonna  make him buy me a drink for this one

 Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get "done in" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one

 I come with an axe to grind.  I wrote two playwriting books of my own.  But one of the reasons I wrote them is because I found so much in this one so wrong-headed.  The idea of starting with a theme or intellectual premise is so bass-ackwards as to be jaw-dropping.  In my experience, you don't start with a theme, you find yourself attracted to characters in a situation that compels you to explore them and it.  Sometime during the middle of the writing (if you're writing honestly), you may find out what the play's theme is.  But theme should emerge organically, not be imposed from the beginning.  To start with theme is like trying to build a skyscraper from the top down.  It may be where you want to go, but, like building a building, you need to start with scaffolding and a foundation.  I trust that when I'm grabbed by character and situation that there has to be some underlying thematic pull.  I don't want to force finding what this is out too early.  If I surprise myself a little, I have a good chance of surprising and delighting the audience.  Now, there is a different craft to writing the first draft and doing rewrites.  I suspect that some of Egri is more applicable to the second stage.  So, yes, obviously I prefer my own books (THE DRAMATIST'S TOOLKIT and SOLVING YOUR SCRIPT).  Also, Thornton Wilder wrote a terrific short essay on the subject in which he talks about the differences between writing fiction and drama.  Since he is the only writer to have won the Pulitzer Prize for both, he comes to the subject with credibility.    I mean, when is the last time you saw a production of an Egri play announced?  
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
    I was really looking forward to this book when I ordered it. It seemed like an interesting peice of litreture. However, I found the writing in it really childish, and I also found myself trying to decipher the odd spellings and grammar in the book.  At the end of the book, I was left wondering what the moral, lesson, or message was. The only thing I really picked up was that it was "okay to be gay", and even that theme didn't shine through strongly. I really felt this book lacked conclusion, as well as a theme.  Though, I do not doubt that this book is fairly true to life... 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 This book bears litthe relevance to the 'original' fourth edition book of the same name. There is no coordination with the text. Most of the concepts are explained in terms of economics not computer science, I have to wonder if the whole idea is a gross mistake or a scam. I feel cheated 
 This is an interesting book, in that it might encourage the reader to think about things outside of the one's traditional framework.  However, if you take the time to dig up the articles that Radin uses as "proof", you will find that some of them are all but incoherent.  I tracked down the authoring scientist behind some of the papers regarding time, and he informed me that his results were due to chance and not replicable (and also that he is no longer a scientist).  It makes me wonder if Radin actually read the articles before disseminating incorrect information to the public.  I realize that scientists have to eat too, but Radin should never have sold a book at the expense of truth.  Also, be careful with the graphs, which are often organized in a deceptive way.  I can verify that some of the psychokinesis stuff is legit, but I would advise anyone who reads this book to a) take it as fiction, b) find the original articles, and c) try to replicate the experiments yourself.  It sets us all back to have people spreading false information.  Peace 
 After three weeks the batteries fails.  I buy a knew one in Walmart, and less expensive 
 It's OK But dated I thought it would more up to Date . My mistake I should have checked the publishing Date: 
 I love Gene Kelly but I don't love this book. I don't see the point in the AFI tribute, just get to the history. The only good thing I can say about this book is that Gene Kelly's talent and determination come through, but that is nothing the author did, that was Gene Kelly and you can get that from any book, any movie, and any story told about him. 
 This is just a REALLY bad book.  First I blame James Patterson, but I really REALLY blame his editor.  What editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published?    The villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains.  Just - over the top. The plot line is unbelievable.  Aside from Alex Cross and the two villains, nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever.  Alex Cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the FBI to foil the villains.  This is supposed to be one of those "the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world" type thriller but - there's no sense of urgency, and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched, and inept (but not deliberately written that way).  I could go on and on but it's not worth the words.  This book is REALLY a waste of time.  I can't believe anybody published it 
 WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!!!!  The twist is that the "real" music isn't on here...  This CD is what I would expect if it said live accoustic version.  To even compare itself to the greatest hits it should have the hits on there. There is no ROCK 
 I would not tell anybody about this book it is awfull.  every receipe I made turned out gross.  the pizza crust was dry and paper thin and the bread was even worse.  I have gotten a ton of better recipes of the internet for free.  save yourself the money and  look on the celiacs websites.  the soft bread recipe on there is excelent.  my daughter that doesn't have celiacs likes it better than normal bread 
 Have you ever heard how an artist has a particular strength and weakness? For example, being able to draw really good faces, but not-so-good hands or feet? I feel that Ian Irving is like that -- he writes a good, entertaining read (obviously, since I am going through book #4), but his "weakness" is character development, particularly romances. I know romance plays a pretty prominent role in most fantasy and sci-fi books, but this is not Irving's strong point. The romances seem shallow, improbable, and rushed. I had a hard time enjoying the story because of them. But as other readers have mentioned, there is "something" about the books that make you coming back for more.  So what is Irving's strong point? Food descriptions -- pay attention to every meal mentioned in the books. You will learn the texture of cheese, the ripeness of fruit, the grains in every bread mentioned, etc., etc. It's almost humorous how much detail goes into food, but not character development.   If I had any advice to give, it would be for Irving to to write a cookbook, or perhaps a Zagats review or two. I'm sure they would be captivating, and right up his alley. 
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 The book contains the complete works of Arthur Rimbaud in chronological order, in both English and French. There is an excellent short introduction to Rimbaud, along with a very nice explanation of the translation process, and the difficulties inherent in translating poetry.  Sadly, the translations presented in this volume do a grave injustice to Rimbaud. In his efforts to render an accurate contemporary translation, Mason removes nearly every vestige of poetic rhythm and rhyme from his poems. Even though my French is inadequate to enjoy Rimbaud in his original language, I found myself turning frequently to the French versions of the poems, as I tried to understand how a poet of Rimbaud's reputation could possibly write so poorly. In poem after poem, the French version was more readable than Mason's translation even though I could only understand about a third of what I read.  I ended up exchanging the book for a version translated by Paul Schmidt, which was much more readable. Ironically, Mason offers criticism of Schmidt's translation in his book.  While this book might be a worthwhile addition to the library of someone already familiar with Rimbaud, I would recommend that any person seeking an introduction to his poetry look elsewhere for a translation 
 I was disappointed with this book as the majority of cards are Christmas related and a lot of them are from the same contributers. There is some nice stuff in there but with 1000 'greetings' I had hoped for A LOT more variation and not all American but International cards 
 Why would anyone buy a biography of Jim Morrison by authors who write on page 465 (bottom of page):  "Maybe what destroyed him was their refusal to let him set them free, or more likely, his realization that he had wasted the best years of his life on a few pages of misguided philosophy."  The authors are making reference to the period of time when Jim Morrison was down and facing the thought of having to return to the Florida court system to once again face the trumped up charges that he faced in the Florida crimminal case launched against him.  Jim Morrison "wasted the best years of his life on a few pages of misguided philosophy"? I think not. I think the authors "wasted their time writing this book, and it is a waste of time to read this book". Aloha. Peace. 
 The book is probably great to those that know nothing about any psychological concepts.  But most of the information is already out there on the internet or in other psychological books.  This is definately not for people who already have done prior research.  Many of the ideas like finding your "inner child" seem somewhat implausible to me.  
 Enya has such a lovely voice. I have truly enjoyed her music, but this CD was a big disappointment. It seemed to stray from her roots. Enya's music has always taken me to my Celtic roots, but this CD was too much pop. 
 Frequent with biographies, the subjects by nature or design overshadow their conveyance, the lives greater than the telling. With Alex Kershaw's handling of London, the disjunctive telling of the life seems to overshadow the greatness of the subject. Kershaw provides documented anecdotal events in London's life, but these episodes are weakly connected, seemingly the paragraphs lack smooth continuity, making the reading of some sections an effort to connect the sequence of events a muddled mess. In a section of Chapter 4, "The Boy Socialist," Kershaw describes London's burn-out from cramming for entrance-exams for Berkeley, his passing with distinction, his fleeing the world by setting sail, his re-course to moor, his impulse to get drunk on shore, and then his arrival "at Berkeley in autumn 1896, in high spirits" (46-47). THEN, we're offered an ancedote about London's comeuppance in a boxing ring, a recollection by a contemporary about his attire, followed by the philosophical influence of Herbert Spencer's book (48).  Kershaw's neglect of the biographer's role (and duty) to segue events, providing coherence and significance in the synthesizing of complex elemental parts to a life whole, distracts me from the subject. Yet I expect all biographies to be as great in the telling as their subjects, like Johnson's Boswell or Wolfe's Donald or Joyce and Wilde's Ellman or Genet's White. Kershaw does indeed emerge as a singular teller of a great life, and his telling is marked by fleeting absurdities involving subtly recurring images of human mastication and digestion: "Bite as he did, Jack did not fully digest the philosophies.  He chose only that which tasted good, and then wolfed [sic] it down.  The tastiest morsel . . . ." (48).  Unfortunately, I was stuck with the tab, and here's my tip 
 Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend 
 I'de have never read Vibe in the first place, but i won a free years subscription in some online contest.  And i must also mention i'm a huge fan of hip-hop and hip-hop culture, so i'de think Vibe would be tight.....daamn, was i ever wrong.  First off, half the mag is Advertising....then what little reading there is....it's all bullsh**.  The interviews they have with artists are totally weak & watered down.  They never ask any worthwhile questions.  Vibe also contradicts itself constantly.  In one issue, they'll give an album a low rating & a poor review, then at the end of the year they name that same album one of the years best....what the f***?  Vibe has it's decent moments, but i def. won't be paying for it anytime soon. 
 "Child of the Holy Grail" is the last installment in Rosalind Miles' Guenever Trilogy. "Child of the Holy Grail" focuses on the tension and betrayal between Arthur and his bastard son Mordred, as well as the arrival of the mysterious knight called Galahad. The story then shifted to the grail quests, the fall of the round table, and the scattering of the nights.  I was very pleased with the first two installments in this series, however "Child of the Holy Grail" was definitely lacking. A huge portion of the novel dealt with Lancelot and Guenevere's love affair, which was rocky to say the least. It seemed like every 50 pages she was sending Lancelot away for something he had done and the Guenevere would call him back and then send him away again. On and on like this for about 500 pages, gets really old after a while. I was a tad bit disappointed in this novel, although I would definitely recommend the series 
 Don't waist your money or time on this.  This DVD set is just an over grown advertisment.  They used the mystic of the SEALs to push this, and is more of a case of false advertisment than anything else 
 I had really hoped for an exciting collection of photographs which evoked the sunny carefree Santa Barbara style. Unfortunately, it is primarily composed of photographs of formal highly stylized houses which look like museums. I had wanted to see beach shacks, airy white washed cottages with tons of old rose bushes, cool mediterranean lairs used by Hollywood refugees, grand haciendas overlooking the sea, etc... but this was pretty tame predictable stuff. Such a shame 
 Those of you who were forced to study Latin know the old joke:  "Cave Canem."  It's Latin for "Beware of Dog."  And this story is a definite dog.  Already this early in the series, "F.W. Dixon" has started cannibalizing his own work, thinking that hanging about caves is somehow exciting or mysterious.  Let's face it:  caves are dreary, dark, damp and dismal.  What sort of real entertainment is afforded here?  And besides, about halfway through this story you forget what the boys were looking for.  However, in the revised version, there are a great many fun references to the much-discredited 1964 New York World's Fair, especially the huge Uniroyal ferris wheel that they made look like a big whitewall tire.  Guaranteed to break the ice at parties, that is 
 I've always been interested in how different people arrived on this continent.  I picked up Chiasson's book with interest.  I was immediately not impressed with the repetitive writing style; more suitable for middle school readers than adults.  I was intrigued by his exploration but put off by the jumping around between explorers and periods of time.  He may have located these maps (many produced long after the period he was writing about thus a bit irrelevant)in the order of his telling. However, if the story was to convince the reader of the Chinese presence on this continent before Columbus, his rendition was very jumbled.  The maps of Africa he showed were the ones falsified by Menzies. The original map never showed the hump of West Africa. If you head north you can't miss it. The currents drifts are not fast enought to bring the Chinese to these shores so quickly. Chinese navigation was never as sophisticated as Menzies and Chiasson lead you to believe.    The big unanswered question is why didn't the Chinese reach Europe by sea when they left. Chinese and European traders had already had long contact via the Middle East.  The currents back to china lead to Europe. The answer is they didn't reach Europe because they never came this way.  Chiasson's mountain top appears to really be Kelly Mountain, a well hiked and traveled area on Cape Breton.  Archeologists (sic) viewing the various sites saw nothing of any of his "evidence"--road, wall, 'tiles', platforms.  Even in the book, the two others who travelled to the site made no subsequent attempts to explore the burial plots, photograph or catalog the various sites.  Pointing to pile of rocks and saying smelter can be done by any 6 year old with a vivid imagination.  Likewise, photoshopping aerial photos to highlight shapes is easily done--just look at the faked Beirut photos the Hezbollah gave Reuters.  In short, I think Mr. Chiasson would have had a better tale to tell had he not been beguiled by Menzies.  As an alternative history, this would have made a great fictional story.  Buy the book if you must add it to your collection.  Otherwise, read it in your local library and save some money. 
 This book is written in an engaging fashion for younger readers, so that's why I gave it 2 stars. But I found the attitudes conveyed towards slavery, Native Americans, and Democrats unsettling. I think there are some political motives behind this book. I think the author is trying to indoctrinate youngsters into ultra-conservative Southern Republican political ideas, and a brand of Christianity that makes people outside the church (you know, the OTHER people God loves) think Christ-followers are hateful and crazy.   For example, on p36 it states, "Although it is true that Native Americans were often treated badly by European settlers, they treated one another worse" and "We cannot feel so much pity for the Native Americans when we think of all this." Did they have it coming? They faught and killed each other like every other group of humans on the planet, so we shouldn't feel bad about the injustices perpetrated by white European settlers that the Natives have never recovered from?  And on the two pages that deal with slavery, it is mentioned that the slave trade was profitable for the traders, but "hard on the slaves" who were shipped to the colonies "under difficult conditions." A bit of an understatement.   And, on the subject of the Civil War, "Many people in the south did not own slaves, but they knew how quickly the Southern economy and standard of living would be damaged if the Northern politicians forced Southern farmers to immediately free their slaves." Yikes, what about the slaves' standard of living? No where is it mentioned or even alluded to that slavery in the US was BAD and WRONG. It's not okay to own another human being and treat him or her like an animal (or WORSE).   The reason the North abolished slavery? They had MACHINES to do the work of slaves, so slaves became obsolete. And I quote, "...why slavery was done away with in the Northern states. The reason is primarily that Northern businessmen did not need slave labor to operate their stores and factories because they made much greater use of the new machines that cut down on the amount of hand labor that was necessary to complete a job." No mention of how compassionate Christians (and others) were vehemently opposed to the way slave owners viewed, kept and treated their slaves, or what they did to abolish slavery.  Finally, the treatment of Democrats and Republicans is really unbalanced. The only things mentioned about Carter? How horrible he was for establishing relations with China, that he messed up with the Panama Canal, and his debaucling of the Iran hostage situation. "In short, our country had sunk to new lows during the Carter years." Clinton's claims to fame are creating a huge government against the Constitution and the will of the people (who promptly reelected him), meddling in Bosnia and other war-torn nations, promoting homosexuality, and Monica Lewinsky. (WHY are these last two issues in a book for 9-year-olds?) In contrast, the Repubs get ONLY positive press in this text.  Finally, the book also says on p178, "Sadly, our country's Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that it was illegal for children to pray in the public schools." That's not true. That law pertains to adult-led corporate prayer, but does nothing to prevent a CHILD from praying in school.  If this book is in line with your political views, then you might want to buy it. But I have a hard time believing that anyone in this day and age thinks SLAVERY was really not such a bad thing. For that reason, no one should by it. This text could be supplemented with something more truthful regarding slavery, like a parent-censored version of "The Slave Narratives," which records hundreds of interviews with former slaves about their lives as slaves and after emancipation. 
 In reference to the reviewer below who states that men are more "right-brained" thinkers, it is interesting to note that modern science is now demonstrating this is true.  The May, 2005 issue of Scientific American  discusses how men have a more active right-amgydala compared to women, in which men tend to be more central or integrative thinkers.  Women in contrast tend to be more left-amgydala dominant, which is more concerned with finer-detailed aspects of cognitive processes.  Experiments using the drug Propranolol have shown this striking differences between the sexes.  This fits well with experience, where in conversation women tend to focus much more on details that seem superfluous to men who want it put into a context.  For men, the "gist" is what is most important.  Thus, in direct contradiction to Fisher's claim, it is men that are more the contextual, holistic thinkers.  Another interesting find is that women have a markedly higher orbitofrontal-to-amygdala ratio compared to men.  The finding suggest that women on average might be able to then reign in their emotions better than men.  This might very well be true, particularly when it comes to violent impulses.  For other everyday encounters, however, it would seem judging at the rate of faux pas and other social effronteries committed by both sexes that neither gender seems particularly suited in reigning in less-than-desirable emotions.  Given how some companies have had to actually have their human resource departments develop so-called "bully broad"  programs, or anger-management for women managers, it would seem women do not have as an advantage the ability to control themselves emotionally.  To be fair though, this might be more owed to the past trend of having looked the other way when a woman did something offensive because she was not a man, which normally would have gotten a man into trouble more readily.    At the end of the day, however, when all is said and done, the differences between the sexes boils down to differences between individuals.  I tend to think visually.  I cannot recall telephone numbers readily numerically but tend to recall them in terms of their geometric arrangement on the touchpad.  You can say the number to me but it sometimes just doesn't register until I see in down on paper and have it visually in my head.  I can usually control my emotions but I am admittedly an over-emotional and passionate man when it comes to certain political or social stances and I am not at all shy in expressing myself forcibly when a wrong has been done.  I can also be impatient when it comes to having to listen to the women in my life having to go through a laundry-list of details to get to the point, although I've grown more tolerant of this as I've gotten older and think it can be quite charming at times.     In contrast, some of the women that have been personally involved in my life have run the gamut from proverbial "tom-boys," who've been keenly interested in mechanical workings and very visual thinkers as well, to women who've proved an amalgam of just about every trite stereotype assigned to women.  In short, we deal with people-individuals-not some nebulous average such as "women" or "men" said to then represent its individual members.  This point and consideration was thoroughly lost by Fisher, who clearly proves she has a very strong agenda of seeing women ridiculously superior in virtually every realm over man.    I don't fault all women for this error in thinking however; rather Fisher has proved that she is a very lef-amgydala dominant woman unable to see that holistic rich tapestry that is the human race in all its multivariate ways and capacities.   
 I bought this album unheard because I was such a fan of Prince.  Bad move.  I agree with the last reviewer.  I tried to like it.  I really did.  But, there is nothing on here worth listening to, let alone dancing to.  The subject matter didn't bother me (he's certainly been controversial before), but I listened to the entire album straight through and couldn't tell where one song began and another ended.  Bored now.  Only buy this if you're a completist 
 In all my years of reading fiction, I have never felt compelled to write a scathing review/inditment of a book (althought "Haunter" by so-called author Charlee Jacob came close), but this book has finally pushed me over the edge.  I was planning on going into a long diatribe about how the famous authors who submitted glowing reviews should be ashamed of themselves for misleading the public, or how there always seem to be a few of suspicious "five star" amazon reviews for books/movies no matter how abysmal they actually are (hint hint: studio plants and friends of the author).  But the best way to sum up my feelings is in this simple statement: Ramsey Campbell has gone into my wallet and stolen $7.99 (plus tax) of my hard-earned money.  It's true, I paid $7.99 for nothing and I'll never get it back.  Reading should not be a chore, and believe me, this is akin to cleaning a litter box.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  
 I bought this cd many years ago and just now feel the urge to write a review.  I was so disappointed.  I mean the original versions of these songs are good but after listened to half a disc I felt remixed out.  The remixes become boring and just left me thirsty for the original versions.  Also did not like the way the songs were broken out.  One disc is supposed to be mellow and the other is supposed to be jamming but after listening to the disc I wondered why songs appeared on the wrong disc.  There is no flow on these cds.  I am still waiting for the proper greatest hits while this one gathers dust.  Not recommended 
 In February 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that, "most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities."  This conclusion was endorsed by the national scientific academies of the U.S, U.K., Canada, Russian, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Brazil, China, and India, along with numerous other scientific societies around the world.  Christopher Horner disagrees, as do a few scientists and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.  So if you want to believe that there's no anthropogenic global warming, you're stuck with having to explain why the experts got it wrong, and there are two ways to do this.  The hard way is to get some scientists together, do some experiments, and come up with a theory that explains the data better than the existing theory.  Submit your theory to peer review, and argue your case with more data and theory.  The easy way is to get some lawyers and come up with a conspiracy theory.  Conspiracy theories are fun because they require little effort and they always give you the answer you want.  And they're indestructible!  Evidence against the conspiracy theory is proof of the conspiracy.  Lack of evidence for the conspiracy is proof that it's a good conspiracy.  Oliver Stone made a movie about a conspiracy theory, and it was nominated for 8 Academy Awards.  Christopher Horner's conspiracy theory is about 1000 times more complicated than Oliver Stone's.  It requires scientists from all over the world, including people of all sorts of religious, ethnic, and political persuasions to be embroiled.  It requires oodles of falsified data to be published in the most prestigious journals and willfully misinterpreted by compliant funding agencies.  As usual, the media and the UN are in on it too.  Oh, and Horner suggests that the motive for the conspiracy is communism.  Communism!  The Cubans and the mafia must be feeling left out.  Is there any proof that the world's scientific community is in the grips of a communist conspiracy?  Of course not -- that's how we know the conspiracy is working.  The publishers of the Politically Incorrect Guides are really on to something.  If something bothers you, they will sell you a conspiracy theory to make you feel better about it.  Given that conspiracy theories require almost no research, the profit margin has got to be huge.  Heck they published a guide to the science of Intelligent Design more than a year after the guys who invented Intelligent Design admitted that there was no science behind it.  The plot of this one had the world's biologists, geologists, and paleontologists in an atheist conspiracy.  The weird thing is that there is no end of shady dealings in the real world that one could worry about.  Why make up a bunch of wacky conspiracy theories?  I guess it's fun to pick on egghead scientists, but I think you should consider the possibility that your outrage might be more effectively directed elsewhere 
 This book is a great overview to professional responsibility and very interesting but if you rely on it to take the MPRE you will fail.  only write this for people out there like me who are taking a second Bar and MPRE after moving to another state, years after completing law school,  and looking for MPRE study materials online.  There arent ANY MPRE TEST QUESTIONS IN HERE  - you have to do old tests, tons of them, to pass. 
 I'm wallowing in bad feeling after finishing The Horse Whisperer a couple of hours ago.  I'm pretty tired of reading books about people throwing good relationships out the window because they allow themselves to become interested in someone else.  Not only are marriages broken, but trust between parent and child.  I'm also tired of authors portraying these situations as something the character "can not control," "just feels right," etc.  and then ending the book as if everyone has made the best decisions and everything has worked out for the best.    I am saddened that these people do not understand what love is, or for that matter what marriage and a family are.  The pain and heartache, the wreckage of ruined lives that accompanies adultery are suspiciously missing.  I'm writing this review in an effort to dispell the black cloud that has lingered since finishing the book.  I think that all I need now is to hug my sweet, honest husband and dear children, who know that the greatest gift I can give them is to love their father.    That is all.  My vent is over.  Thank you.  
 I'll admit, there are some songs on here that I simply love.  Namely, "Theme" and "Bookstore".  But other than those two, the soundtrack is not good listening.  It doesn't flow well at all, songs like "Bookstore" going into a five minute, rambling "It's the Sun" and then to "Wada Na Tod".  It's not really pleasant to listen to.  It goes great with the movie, but you have to keep in mind that in the movie, a mind is being erased.  "Showtime" especially bothered me.  It works so well in the movie, but to just listen to it?  Doesn't work.  The soundtrack definitely sounds confused and broken, with a few songs of refuge.  Sadly, these songs (like the two I mentioned) are some of the shortest on the album.  ("Bookstore" clocks in at a paltry 52 seconds.)  I would not recommend this purchase based solely on the music.  Jon Brion is great, but it's just not good for listening.  If you loved the movie, like I did, and you simply want to experience it from a different perspective, you might be satisfied with this product.  Otherwise, watch the movie and skip this buy 
 condition is very bad, all pages dirty, many folded, cover scratched, and pages in the back of the book had holes.  too expensive for $15, i would only sell it for half of that price 
 i read the castle in the attic and i thoght it wasn't very entrtaning. but that's just my opinion. i thought on some of the chapters it dragged on and lost me alot. like it would talk about one thing and then another without alot of detail. for my opinion, it was an ok book. it had it's moments like whats going to happen next then it was really boring. 
 "The Artist's Complete Guide to Drawing the Head" by William L. Maughan,  Watson-Guptill Pub, $24.95   160 pages    The title  is a  a boast. It is not  "complete" in any sense.  First,  it is too brief. Second,  every portrait model shown here holds a totally passive expression.  Not one shows the least bit of emotion;  neither fear, anger, joy,  leering, laughing, scowling or anticipation. They simply stare vacuously straight ahead or to the side with an empty, torpid expression.  A really "complete" guide to any kind of drawing will show some animation or feeling  or variety of a range of feelings.       I am alerted by usage in the title of a major "Warning Word"  or phrase.  This time it is the words  "COMPLETE  GUIDE."  When you find "Warning Words" like COMPLETE,  ULTIMATE,  ESSENTIAL  etc   on the cover of a book,  the book will generally be substandard as  a general rule.  None of the really good drawing books ever use words like that.  Books using the word COMPLETE,  never seem to live up to that claim, and in fact,  they usually skip over basics, and move right on to intermediate material.        The bestializized   Half-human/half-hog, and Half-human/half-elephant, or Half-human/half-vampire  portraits are entirely beyond the scope  of the topic, pertaining to fantasy art and not human anatomy.  It certainly is not appropriate for small children. Moreover,  it falls entirely outside of the category of the human head, which is what the book suggests.           The art work is flat, absent of mental focus,  and uninspiring, lacking in dynamism and vitality. The models are listless and possess no expression of emotion in their face, and  they reflect a HUMANITY WITHOUT FEELINGS! I find that offensive.      I would  point out that from my personal perspective,  I am highly suspicious of artists who draw human beings without FEELINGS.  Healthy people show expressions,  and artists who fail to acknowledge the FEELINGS of their subjects,  probably have an imbalanced view of the external world, and I just cannot trust them.   [There are people in the world utterly blind to the reality that their own FEELINGS register on their face,  so that as their feelings register on their face,  they are unaware that you are "reading" them. Isn't that peculiar? ] The models here have a One-Dimensional quality.  Not only can the artist not sense the FEELINGS of the models,  the artist is showing evidence that FEELINGS are not  integrated as part of  a personal artistic vision. Some might refer to this as art, but...            The list price of $24.95 indicates the public will be thoroughly robbed.      If you enjoy alternatively,  lifeless portraiture and fantasy portraiture,  at a rip-off price,   this book is for you; but for myself,  I am not interested in any instruction by someone purporting to be some kind of  "teacher" who cannot even represent a full range of human emotions and expressions and feelings and is unaware of the degree of their inadequacy. 
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 Nelson makes very good points about helping the disenfranchised graduate students and unexployed Ph. D.s in the profession, and his consideration for them is very commendable. His disdain for and desire to purge all tenured academics who don't share his views, however, is pretty astonishing: though he claims to be against old-boy snobbery, his dislike for graduate programs poorer or less sophisticated than his own as well as for elitist institutions seems to suggest that only he and his friends should be kept in power and prestige. His vision of the academy isn't really a place where ideas are interchanged--it's one where his own biases and opinions are reinforced and rewarded 
 I agree with most of the other reviewers that this is a very weak production with lots of pretentious talk and some pretty poor musical performances which are heavily cut to make more room for chatter. However the couple of minutes where Rory Block sings "If I had Possession Over Judgement Day" are worth the entire price of this DVD. Don't buy the tape 'cos you'll have to sit through so much stuff you won't make it, but on the DVD you can go straight to Rory Block and never watch the rest 
 The best thing you could do for yourself is don't subject yourself to reading this adolescent book.  If buying just a small thing from Tiffany's and using the shopping bag as a planter gives you a thrill, then this is for you.  Not me!  Sorry 
 This book, How the Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis, had several very distinct themes.  First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid.  "To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities.  "As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business." (Riis, p. 21)  Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well. 	The next theme to emerge was that of work.  In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women "kept house" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys.  "The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows." (Riis, p. 49)  Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people.  "Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job.  They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their `hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed.  If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent.  The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits." (Riis, p 94) 	Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements.  "Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death." (Riis, p. xvii)  People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate.  The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader.  And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.  	As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today.  It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity.  Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down.  "The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements.,  In many ways, as in the `College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives." (Riis, p. 207)  Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless.  "The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers.  It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme." (Riis, p. 205) 	Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section.  Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements.  The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work.  Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house.  "Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights.  Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work." (Riis, p. 105)   But how did people in this situation become educated to work?  "The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements.  Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered.  In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him.  Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him.  Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals.  Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways." (Riis, p. 136)   	Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader.  In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place.  Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response.  Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told.  For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy.  The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements.  "Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own." (Riis, p. xiii)   	I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people.  He very much accomplished his purpose.  By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes.  It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this.  Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination.  The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended.  The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving. 	The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world.  The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults.  I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need.  When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action.  I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard.  This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings.  
 It truly is the best war fiction regarding WWII if you have never read ANY other fiction regarding WWII. I love war fiction and non-fiction and beside parroting the Time Magazine blurb prominently displayed in the novel I can not even come close to understanding why anyone, let alone review after review, would even come close to that stupefying conclusion. To me it is the best example of intellectual snobbery that critics like to pat themselves on the back with. Only they understand and you lesser intellects are not capable of appreciating. What it is, is a bloated, narcisstic, misogynistic waste of time.   Of course any piece of literature is subjective, but to me, this critically acclaimed work fails on every level that a novel should, regardless of genre. Unless you love James Joyce (another bad writer lorded over us by the critically elite), I think most readers expect some sort of plot development. Don't expect that here. How about engaging characters that develop and grow throughout the novel? You better pick up something else.  It seems to me the reader should at least be invested in one of the character's outcome. Far too pedestrian a thought if you "get" this art. If I can't have any of that how about writing a character that is even remotely likable? Forget it non-ivy leaguer! I was rooting for the Japanese to kill them all, so at least their "loved" ones at home would be spared of these nearly universally despicable human beings. The only thing that propelled me to finish was to get to the ending that would perhaps tie together the painful experience of reading these soldier's hateful ruminations while, oh by the way, a war was being fought around them. Nope, no big ending either. It just ends.   Yes, I have heard that the plodding ugliness and pointlessness of the entire book is to symbolize war itself. Give me a break. While this may be bad news for us common folk duped into reading it, it certainly is good news for Tom Clancy. His last two decades of literature are just misunderstood genius depicting the banality of human existence and not bad writing at all. 
  . . . and more nonsense.  Like I've stated in previous reviews, the only reason I read any of this c**p is because as a professional Christian educator and theologian, questions about stuff like this come up far more often than I would like -- and I've gotta have my ammo ready.  Here we go again:  Dispensational pre-millinalism, which is the theology presented in the book as "authentic" Christianity, was invented out of whole cloth in the mid 19th century.  This is not the faith of the Apostles.  This is not the faith of the Early Church (East or West).  This is not the faith of the Reformers.  Luther and Calvin would have rejected this.  This is not the faith of the Great Awakening.  Wesley and Whitfield would have rejected this.  Even in Protestantism, this represents a minority "out there" viewpoint.  A non-Christian who picks up one of these books and believes that it represents mainstream Christianity will be grossly deceived.  This is not honest theology; this is not honest biblical interpretation; and the writing is horrible to boot 
 In my opinion the author is completely off base with his theories.  I don't see how this book can help anyone of any age.  I'm glad this was a borrowed book.  My time could have been better spent on a cheap romance novel 
 Alas, it is no satire.  If it were satire, Our Heroine would not be right Every Single Time (even when she's being stupid), and the author would be sniggering at her instead of with her.  It's amazing how well she can bend other people to her will with only a single speech, or a single flash of her nipples.    It's also amazing how often Our Heroine is both average and extraordinary.  She's a mid-level bureaucrat AND the Emperor's ex-wife.  Everyone who's anyone is beautiful AND she's gorgeous even by those standards.    What we have here is not satire but Mary Sue.  And a badly written one at that 
 The last Star Wars novel I read that was based on a video game was the excellent "Republic Commando: Hard Contact" by Karen Traviss.  I had hopes that "The Ruins of Dantooine" could be nearly as good as the Traviss novel, but it wasn't to be.  "The Ruins of Dantooine" felt somewhat like a video game and it just wasn't very good.  The story was fairly simple and quest orientated and wasn't nearly as engaging as it could have been.    The Empire learns that a Rebel Holocron has been left on the planet Dantooine.  The holocron contains a full list of all of the Rebel Alliance spies within the Empire.  If it falls into the hands of the Empire it could effectively crush the ability of the Rebellion to operate.  Everything would be compromised.  The Empire sends one of their spies to recover the holocron.  The Alliance sends Finn Darktrin to locate the holocron before the Empire finds it.  An Empire biologist, Dusque Mistflier, somehow gets mixed up into the search for the holocron and assists Finn as Dusque becomes more and more disillusioned with the realities of the Empire.    This book just wasn't very interesting.  The story itself is quite basic and followed a video game structure with missions and a boss battle.  While the chance to explore Dantooine, and a post Prequel Trilogy Naboo was potentially interesting, the overall experience was weak and lacking.  The one good thing here is that there is no need to have played the game to understand the story, but I can only hope that the game was better than this book.  It was a nice effort, but the only reason to read this book is to read every Star Wars book published.  That's about it.    -Joe Sherr 
 Changing Minds is very disappointing - average to very poor writing, poor development of ideas, ideas that have been shown to be weak or invalid constructs, and very little substance.  You will learn very little about how to change anyone's mind or your own.  Reading this book and finishing it is a grind 
 this book is lousy its the worst. It promises alot but doesn't deliver.  If you want to learn to write meaningless every day conversation like:  "Hi how are you Sam?"  "I'm fine thanks George."  Then this book is for you. It never gets past the above formatt of dialogue and the narrative of this book is boring and hard to understand. The writer is a bafoon who admittedly carries a journal around recording conversations like the above "Hi sam..." The book is so annoying it make me want to scream.  
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 I found two paperbacks at work, which were both thriller series, both written by women, both having two word titles with the first word being "Blind."  One of the two I found exciting and satisfying, and eagerly read it.  That was not this book.  At first, I thought it was just me.  Unlike others, I found it easy to get into the book.  But I found it too new age for me.  Between Eve talking to her dead daughter to the creepy Aldo to Jane's connection with the murdered Cira, I decided I didn't need to read the whole novel and checked to make sure Jane and Trevor survived.    Maybe this wasn't Iris Johansen's best book.  But I'm not going to be trying any of her others, based on this one 
 Because it is hardly about Updike at all.  And if you read it because you like Baker, I'd wager there is a very good chance you will like him less afterwards.  Baker comes across as a smarmy, smirking, egotistical, overreaching, worrisome irritating twit.  Maybe this is supposed to be funny; well, it isn't.  He came up with a stupid idea for an essay, and despite its shortness, it is stretched out and completely empty.  I read this book because it came to hand, and I am interested in Updike.  I finished it because it is so slight and quick a read, and I gave it numerous chances to turn around.  Certainly I should have known enough to stop when he announces that writing novels is really the purview of women and homosexual men, and that he and Updike succeed only despite the fact that they are heterosexual males.  Well, here's your opportunity to learn from my mistake: skip this thing.  This is a truly horrid, pointless little book 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 After attending several of mr. Dershowitz's lectures I had expected better.  The dialouge in this book is almost too painful to read.  To think that this book came from the mind of such an eloquent orator.  Mr  Dershowitz should stick to the spoken word 
  Do dogs understand language?  Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies...  The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I'll say, "What do we do on an elevator?" and they'll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, "Look!  They understand every word you say!"    Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying "What do we do on an elevator?-we sit."  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from "What do we do on an elevator?" to "Sit" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.    Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog "understands" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.   Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.    Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be.  It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple.    Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth.    Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.    I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, "Do you love me?" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.  It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.    If I could I'd give this book no stars at all 
 ...I was bored.  This despite some top-notch performances (especially Sean Bean); costumes, settings.  The actress playing Clarissa merely came off as a self-rightous little prig.  You're not supposed to feel relief when she dies, but I sure did.  She's not very pretty either, so the attraction or lust that Lovelace felt was inexplicable -- I guess corrupting her absolute innocence and strong morals were the real attraction...yet despite his dastardly deeds, I felt more pity for Lovelace.  The story does drag a bit; don't let the rave reviews fool you.  It's worth seeing for Sean Bean and several of the supporting performances but the story moves too slowly and is on the whole a very depressing one.      
 Promising start. A sniper kills people, seemingly randomly. When asked why, he says "God told me to". Other mass murders occur, and the murderers all claim that God told them to do it.   After 25 minutes the mystery slowly starts to unfold. There is a "sect" of middleaged and elderly men who have been gathered telepathically. They know what is going on. UFO:s in the past explain some mysterius births. And "God" turns out to be not too impressive. Why, oh why, did they try to explain it all so stupidly?  The movie is dedicated to the memory of Bernard Herrmann, the famous movie music composer (Vertigo, Psycho and much more), and the music often resembles the intense string music of Herrmann. There is some good choir music too. The acting is good all over. Good pictures. Slow tempo, but not too slow. And the script is good up until one third of the movie. So, what happened? I have three theories:  1. After writing script for the first part of the movie, the script writer died and the story was completed by someone else. (Since only Cohen is credited as writer I guess this theory won't hold up...) 2. They wanted to do a film with some cool music and dedicate it to Bernard Herrmann, so they wrote the music first and then wrote scenes that would fit the music, not minding if the story turned out to be rather strange (and stupid). 3. The script writer had read too much von Dniken ("God is a UFO, just look here in Ezechiel...").   Anyway, here is another example of a movie that has most thing going for it, but lacks a good story to back it up with. And a good story means something. At least, if you try to be clever, like this film does.  This movie is sometimes called "Demon" 
 It's good if you are about 12. At least that is the reading level of this book. Super easy to read, which can make it a bit boring. I felt there wasnt enough character development 
 sorry, can't finish this garbage movie. is this girl retarded  or what? watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all. how and why the garbage collecting, turned cow feeder young guy, would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer? there's no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath. the girl didn't look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character. the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless. what? life was too boring then what? started becoming natural born killer? give me a break. bone chilling? you can always say that again, but won't make me care a bit more. 
 i must say i'm a huge who fan my favorite albums are "who by numbers" and"who's next" but this "my generation" i bought the re-issue of the vinyl for £20 and it's my first time i've listened too this album and if fact i'm sorely disapointed it's a throwaway album at best..the only highlights are "my generation" "kids are alright" "legal matter" "the ox"  they hadn't mastered the makings of a great album yet give them till "a quick one" now that's a masterpiece this and i'm ashamed to say it is a poor excuse of an album..not the who i love..a band getting it together with only a couple high... 
 I have two words of horror for you, Electronics Expo.  I purchased this set through Amazon, who then relied on Electronics Expo to send the TV.  First off, they sent it via UPS rather than a qualified TV delivery service like Amazon uses.  When I hooked up the TV, the picture worked for 30 seconds then went to a green screen and blinked once in a while.  I called Samsung and they said that they would send someone out in about a week, but if the problem occurred during shipping, the waranty wouldn't cover the repair.  I decided to email Electronics Expo to request a new set and ask for a shipping label.  They emailed me and told me that they wouldn't accept a return of a TV over 20 inches!  I read the return policy and noticed that it only applied to returned items for unwanted items, not defective items.  Electronics Expo then ceased to return my emails.  I called and spoke to a manager who tried telling me that if the item was damaged while shipping, I would have to wait for them to be reimbursed by UPS before my new TV was shipped!  The TV looked great for the 30 seconds that I actually saw a signal, but if this is being shipped by Electronics Expo, play it safe and spend the extra money to buy it elsewhere 
 Every once in a while I go out and buy another strategy book to flip through, and honestly, I am generally disappointed in what is out there. This book however ranks among the worst. The first sign is the blatant grammatical and spelling errors starting in Chapter 1 (i.e. "...then we are run like hell out of the trade."). The second warning bell comes with the gross misrepresentations about the market in general (i.e. "...low-price stocks translates into a higher-risk premium and, as a category, these low-priced stocks tends to do well..." - again, the author's grammar, verbatim). Sometimes the poor grammar can be chalked up to someone who is so into their game that they skipped less important classes when they were young (i.e. grammar, spelling, literature), and market hype can be the result of true passion, albeit a wee bit overzealous. Unfortunately, the reader quickly discovers the actual content is not very useful either, and is just a re-hashing of weak systems containing catchy buzz words and simplistic formulas 
 A very boring book. It goes into the very basics of Russian culture. It only had a couple pages about dating a Russian. I have been there twice in the last year, and didn't find the book useful at all. Find another book to read about Russian Culture and social dynamics 
 We used this book for an adult Sunday School class that I taught.  I was extremely disappointed by the superficial treatment of the text.  I found myself using the Biblical text and other sources.  For the most part Dr. Swindoll's book was a distraction rather than a help.  For example, 2 Samuel 7 descibes God's covenant with David that Christ, the True King, would be David's descendant.  Swindoll uses this text as to how to react when God says no to our plans. (In this case, it is God's rejection of David as the builder the temple that Solomon eventually built)  The covenant IS the point and Dr. Swindoll completely misses it. If your looking for moralisms that you really already knew this is your book.  If you want a serious study of the life of David you would do well to look elsewhere or try something bold-- a careful reading of the Biblical text. 
 Too much of personal letters not much variety of bussiness letters. Very simple choice of words. I could'nt use it at al 
 I hate to part company with the other reviewers here, as well as the Amazon comments but this NOT a must have.  I am huge fan of New Order and Joy Division and think they are one of the most important modern western popular bands of the last, almost thirty years for all their well-known contributions to existentilism and furturism in alternative, independent rock. Basically inventing post-punk, being one of the inventors of the dance-music, electronica scene a decade before most other bands and accidentaly inventing "goth" music along the way.  Not to mention being excellent musicians with a very artsy, deep and humorous sensitivity.  But, because they are such a good band it is glarringly obvious that the "rock video" is nothing more than a corporate music business era chore that bands just have to do as part of the job.  Film critic Rodger Ebert once said the rock video is "empty."  Here, they aren't so much empty as New Order's music is so good, just pointless.               I find myself almost angry that a beautiful song such as "Ceremony" would have such a terrible video like this(incidently, I do not know what the viewer below is talking about...there is no original version of the "Ceremony" video...just this thing). An aweful, unwatchable piece of useless garbage featuring a fellow walking around with a trashbag on his head. I guess that is a reference to the thought process of music video directors. Not sure what else it could be. I could only stomach 40 seconds of this filth. I'm afraid after listening to this tune for more than ten years, both Joy Division's and New Order's...the images in mine and in other musician's heads will have to do. Unwatchable. Trash. The new "Tempation" video....embarrasing.  Watch their concert videos, go see them live or better yet, think for yourself.  There are a few winners..."Confusion" is a classic and a great video as well as little bit of music history.  "Perfect Kiss" is cool but I've seen it enough and life is short. "Touched By the Hand of God" is very funny..but ..again..life is short. The only thing I hadn't seen before and actually kind of liked was the Gina Birch "Crystal"..that was a slightly cool workday music industry bit. Not important art in anyway....but better than Franz Fernidad peeing on an art gallery wall like the Nazis used to do.  Videos?  As for the documentary on the other disc. This is much better but is almost 13 years old. There are some excellent Joy Division clips here. Why don't we have a full DVD of all the Joy Division footage in the world yet? You get many of the same videos on the other disc played in full again on THIS disco too..in case you're someone like me who hated them enough the first time. Some great stuff, a bit of live Joy Division, great early live versions of 'Blue Monday", "Tempation"..and yes.."Ceremony". The interviews are great as New Order speaks like real musicians and their collaborators are an interesting bunch making up a lot of what urban nightlife music culture has been from the late seventies until today on both sides of the Atlantic. 
 NO REAL ANALYSIS, UNSUBSTANSIATED, TOO MUCH HYPE AND SELF PRAISE. NOTHING MORE THAN AN AVERAGE TRADER KNOWS ALREADY BY EXPERIENCE. JUST A INTERESTING OBSERVATION, NO RIGOROUS PROOF, OF NO REAL PRACTICAL USE 
 The 1947 Nobel Laureate in literature Andre Gide (1869-1951) wrote this short story in 1919. It is considered to be a lyrical prelude to his major novel "the Counterfeiters", published seven years later. This story is similar to "the Counterfeiters" in a way that it explores the falsehood that exists in the relationships between people.  The story tells about a rural pastor, who adopts, out of mercy, an orphaned girl, whose condition is further aggravated by the fact that prior to becoming an orphan, she had been living with an elderly and somewhat deaf aunt; therefore, she is not adept in understanding the language that people speak and the connection that exists between words and perceptions. The pastor undertakes the responsibility of educating the blind girl - her name is Gertrude - in accordance with the methods that are used to educate the blind. At the same time, the relationships within the pastor's family grow complex ...   This story is a rebellion against rigours of religious postulates. At one time it enjoyed a great popularity in author's native France and in 1946 its screen version was released. However, the likelihood that the story, the way it is described, could take place indeed is somewhat low. Not only the believability of the plot line is questionable, the emotions seem to be overdramatised. "The Counterfeiters" does not share these drawbacks, though 
 There ARE some good ideas in here. Unfortunately I just couldn't get past the fact that it is such a thin book with a lot of rehashed stuff. 14.95 is a lot to pay for a magazine, even if some of the ideas are OK. Also, Ms. Stewart doesn't seem to feel the need to test her recipes out first. When following ANY of her recipes, allow a little extra time for recipe adjustment. 
 I haven't received this product yet and I'm pretty upset about it. I've requested that someone contact me about this problem and I haven't been given an answer.  I think I'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer.   Where is the product I bought??? 
 I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called "Thin Fire Wire". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.  Shame on you Sony 
 Mr. Shore's book couldn't possibly be more pretensious, or more out of touch with the fundamental changes that are taking place in the world of photography.  His writing is wordy, his perspective self-promotional, and  his ideas are trapped in the critical perspective of a mid 1970's college  professor.  If you're interested in a book that explores photography in the  pre-digital era, you'd be better off spending your money on John Berger's  "Ways of Seeing", or Sontag's "On Photography" 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it was so long-winded and unfocused.  I felt that I was being pulled through the dark forest of the author's mind rather than the concrete experience of other people's pain.  If she had written this as a journal it would have made more sense-maybe 
 Though I love Brother Cadfael, this story was most tedious and far-fetched.  I couldn't believe that this young woman would do what she did for a man she hardly knew, and the conclusion drags out too long and  elaborately, once you realize who she is.  I've read worse books, but after  the true excellence of most of the other Cadfael novels, this one was a  strange, sad let-down 
   Welcome to the book with no point. This book is not clever, funny or consistent. The drawing style is ripped off from Ralph Steadman. If you are a fan of Bigfoot, do not buy this book 
 I AM TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK! I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEVERLY PRESENTED. WHY AREN'T THINGS JUST STACKED UP ON ONE ANOTHER IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL PLANE? FROM THE COVER, IT LOOKS LIKE THE PERSPECTIVE IS ALWAYS FROM THE TOP. WHAT THE HECK? ARE WE JUST LOOKING DOWN ON THESE PEOPLE? AND WHY ARE THE CAUCASIANS ON TOP AND SHOT AT NIGHT, WHEN THE PERUVIANS ARE ON THE BOTTOM AND SHOT DURING THE DAY? 
 I absolutely love Elizabeth Berg and started to fall in love when I first read her novel "Open House".  I was soooo excited to finally read "joy school".  Well, it did not add up to Berg's other books at all, and I was very disappointed.  Since I am in my early 20s, I found the character Katie to be nothing like a 13 year old.  Her character was very unbelieveable.  I constantly felt like I was rolling my eyes at Katie while I was reading.  In Berg's other books, the characters are dynamic and interesting and believeable.  This book was not all I hoped 
 Alright, for those of you who say Rand is criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, I say this: who is Rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are?  Who is Rand to say what substance is?  You've got to look at her bias, first.  Realize that Rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  As if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  Maybe her life in an oppressive Russia did nothing to form who she is today.  But I doubt it.  Though I believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live, outside influences do affect a person.  But she doesn't.  Thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap.  All books that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason: don't read, cause it will lessen your IQ.    Any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot understand, she condemns.  Rand, at least as portrayed in what I've read of her work, is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants.  And this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes.  They cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality, they are either good or worthless.   The pieces of art she says are empty ARE empty, absolutely.  They don't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer.  Nothing to offer her, that is.    How is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history's best books, telling OTHER people (with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual) What they should read?  Truthfully any criticism in this form, like a list I saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world, is elitist crap trying to close people's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others.  They have their bias like anyone else.  I say read in variety.  Observe art outside of Rand's choice of art.  Take in all you can, with an open mind, then start pondering whether you agree or not.  If you then agree because YOU agree, then I say great.  Its the basic individualistic response that Rand seems to forget to address.  She says question society, but by my line of inquiry.  She says be an individual, but only I know the basis of who you want to be 
 This text proves that on the internet or in print, a person or persons can create a completely fictional persona and "resume" of qualifications. I recommend searching further for a text with more experienced, polished, knowledgeable authors 
 If you are short on money, do not buy this C.D.  You will regret it.  However if you are trying to get rid of a gift voucher or something side one is really good, especially the Dr. Evil "just the two of us".   Really this is not a good album, as side two is rubbish.  I still haven't  listened to it all the way throug 
 First of all let me say that I am a serious reader.  I purchase books before I even read what I've already purchased.  Anyhow, I'm tired of supporting books marketed to African Americans, yet not being appreciated.  Time and time again the books are riddled with errors and this is so unacceptable.  You don't find this problem with other books.  It's like their saying so what they are going to buy the books anyway.  I'm really getting tired of being taken advantage of.   Anyhow, I found this book to be unrealistic.  This girl goes from being a young virgin to a professional whore in one breath.  No street knowledge to a gansta girl tricking men for money.  Just too unrealistic.  The book was also kind of a slow read but picked up towards the end.  The book was okay, however, not one of the best or one that I would really recommend 
 I liked this machine while it worked, but I started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago.  I got busy and suddenly the warranty was up, and then the other day, it just wouldn't turn on at all.  I had it for 15 months 
 LCD fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker wasn't stong enough. Anyhow,I could push it back. Then, the scale couldn't be turned on by tapping on the top. This is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual. I have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime! I think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken. This is the problem I can't fix.  The only thing I can do is sending it back.  Following up: According to the other review, I tried to make this scale "vibrating" using different ways of tapping. It didn't work no matter how hard I tried. I had to use my toe to lift up one side a little (about half an inch) and drop it on hard floor to make enough "vibration" to turn it on. I wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on. My Soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping. I have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate. Just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass. And also, be careful to use it in bathroom: moisture will make the glass surface slippery.  
 His fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow. There is some wisdom here and there, but not worth the headache you'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head. Here is an example: "If you say your own name to yourself at such a moment, it will seem utterly alien. You will then understand the sacrament of baptism." Huh?  At first, I thought his writing may just be over my head, but after re-reading most of it, I realized it was just bad. It's like the whole book was written when he was high or something. Some very good ideas, but most can be found in other, better written books. 
 For some time I was very interested in raw foods, but disliked all the recipes that relied on fruit and grains as staples.  Upon reading all the positive reviews of this book and hearing about how it de-emphasized the fruit and grains, I was very gung-ho about ordering it.  I now use this book as a paperweight, because it isn't really good for anything else.  The "science" outlined in the beginning of the book is laughable.  I googled high and low to find any substantiating evidence of the claims the author made concerning pleomorphism and came up with no corroborating facts from any respectable source (quacks abounded, however).  "Fine," I thought, "just because he's a lunatic doesn't mean the recipes can't be tasty."  Well let me tell you, everything I have made out of this book has tasted absolutely terrible.  Vile, even.  It turned me off of broccoli for 2 months.  One time I spend a whole free afternoon making a lovely-looking 3-course raw meal for my fiance and myself using the recipes from this book (carrot ginger soup, fake sushi, and a blueberry pie with pecan crust), and the result was so unappetizing that we had to toss it all in the trash and go out to eat.  I am normally a very good cook (or uncook), so I place blame squarely on the recipes and not on my own abilities.  Please, for your own sake, do not buy this book.  Or at least take my copy, because I sure don't want it anymore.  I give it 2 stars only because the book itself is so attractive looking (seriously, the paper it's printed on is really glossy and nice) 
 Watch the mini series, skip the book.  If you are a fan of history, and I'm certain you are if you're reading this review, skip this book.  Read Rick Atkinson, or Dick Winters' account, anything, just skip this book.  The writing was high school quality, a poor job by the editors (apparently the atomic bomb was "dripped" on Hiroshima), and the story is short on the details that make reading historical accounts interesting.  Enjoy the mini series, but if you're interested in this topic, find another book 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed

 Both Amazon and Sony present this power supply as suitable for the ICF-M410V Sony Radio.  (Check Sony's web page) Only when you receive the wretched thing and go through the slashing, cutting and hacking that modern packaging requires, do you find that this item is completely useless with the radio, emitting a loud hum that drowns out any reception. Now I have to package it up, write and explanatory letter to Amazon, and try to get my money back. Then I'll have to find a power supply that is suitable for the radio.  I have a feeling that I am not going to be successful, as one of the other reviewers has found. So now I'm stuck with a radio that will only function with batteries, after it was presented as being compatable with a charger - why else would it have a female input for a DC jack?  To say that I am annoyed is putting it mildly.  What a bloody scam! 
  This book has all the elements of a bad novel.  First:  No one apparently proof read this book before it was published.   It's full of spelling and grammar mistakes, the main character's name changes several times etc...   Second:  It is excruciatingly redundant.  There's this blue fog.  It's blue on the first page.   It's blue on the last page. It's blue on every page in the middle.   Wiccan's are good, satanists are bad.  On every page.   Don't worry if you don't get it the first fifty times, it will be explained over and over to you.  Third: There's nothing really sexy about it.  It's not enough to tell readers that something is seductive... show them!  In short, the novel is an insult to the intelligence (and literacy skills) of readers.   
 I lived in France. I know plenty of fat French women. And French women who drink hard liquor every day. And French women who drink coffee more than just in the morning.  French women don't have the market on thinness by any means. People all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits. The author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on. And her dropping of French phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying.  Nothing new in this book. Eat less, exercise more. 
 I read a lot. A LOT. And rarely have I read a book that I really, really didn't like, but this is one of them. There is such a lack of dialogue, and the author repeats her same thoughts over and over. I swear, if I would have had to read the words "four years" one more time (referring to the main character's failed relationship) I would have hurt somebody. There was so much that could have been done with this book. But, by the time she actually gets the house, you've been bored stiff for four years and don't much care. It seems to be that it was poorly edited, and there is a lot of awkward grammar. I was really disappointed. 
 Hello!  I was STUNNED by how badly written this book was. ESPECIALLY as one of the authors is supposedly a department chairman at Cornell University! The same unimportant items are repeated over and over and over throughout this short (large type, few words on page) book. Paragraphs or sections start out describing something, get a third or halfway through the thought, then stop abruptly with the authors apparently forgetting to include the needed information to finish the paragraph or section.  The Columbine school shootings are mentioned repeatedly, for no particularly useful reason that I can see, other than to "cash in" on the incident. A single mention of this incident would have been far more than enough to make the few points they wanted to make about it.  A totally useless 8 page or so section, goes on to describe special needs of RICH(!) parents to deal with their children! Special care was taken to describe how wonderful the rich were who could save wealth (I would imagine that this is how the authors view themselves. WHAT was this doing in this book in the first place???). No such special section on child advice was included for either middle class, or poor parents. I found this section to be particularly insulting to just about everyone.  The authors in several places in the book say directly or indirectly how wonderful they are, or how wonderful their book is. This was galling and completely unneccessary.  While touting the book as offering detailed advice on child rearing, this is in essence an outright lie. The little advice they offer is so vague as to be virtually useless.  To save all of you the trouble of reading this book, here are the few points they made: love your child, listen to your child, give your child firm structure and guidance. That's about it. This is just about as detailed as they got with their advice. As you will note, their "advice" is virtually useless in helping parents with specific child rearing problems.  I have read NUMEROUS, much, much better books on child rearing; that quoted research, and then, IN DETAIL, gave many specific, detailed techniques that any normal parent could use with their children. Not ONE single detailed technique was EVER mentioned in this book. NOT ONE.  While research is quoted in this book from time to time, it is mainly along the lines of, "Ain't life horrible nowadays?" In other words, they mentioned many problems, BUT, no solutions. Virtually NO studies were quoted that described solutions to parenting problems.  I am still stunned that Simon and Schuster published this (the hardback edition). I could have forgiven the very poor writing if there had been useful parenting information in this book, but there was none.  I would have given this book ZERO stars if I had been allowed to.  MANY other books are available that are light years ahead of this book in every possible way; please look there for child rearing advice.  Kar 
 ...and to be honest I hated it. She has that dramatic face in every movie, it always looks as if she's going to burst into tears or something - so she's mostly just fit, it seems to me anyway, for these tragic "no hope for mankind"-movies. Plenty is a movie so Britain-grey that you should never watch it on a day you feel tired or something, you'll only get deeply depressed. And do not misunderstand me, I am no fan of shallow comedies, I'm moved by actors like Hopkins in Shadowlands and Penn in Dead Man Walking - but the woman Streep plays in this movie, well, how many women could identify themselves with her? What is Plenty trying to tell us?  Two stars for Stings' effort as Mick in the movie. Not a big role, but his character has "sex" with Streep - and is basically used by her. And finally Mick is the first to call her character "insane" if I remember right. Big Deal? No, but I am a big fan of Sting - therefor let me add : Are you a Sting-fan, add this to your Sting-dvd-collection.  But watching the movie is pain!  
 I thought this book was stupid and unrealistic. I don't really like the older BSC books...the newer ones with Abby are way better. If you want to read it, though, get it from the library...I wouldn't reccomend buying 
 I started reciving Vibe magazine in the mail announced and unexpected. This wouldn't be the first time this happened, turns out my Grandmother bought me People magazine as a gift and the copies were sent to my house. I figured that somebody had got me this magazine as a gift. Next thing I know a charge for the magazine appears on my bank statement.  I called Vibe immediately and asked them what had happened. They told me that there was nothing they could do and that their company didn't directly deal with the payment issues and subscription services. They gave me a toll free number that I was too call from an outside company that handled the payments. When I called this company, it was completely automated service, could not speak with an actual person regardless of what extension I used.  I eventually had to go down to my bank and find out what I could do. Turns out Vibe had illegally gained my bank account number and had been charging me for months, but I had only just recently started to recieve the magazine. I had to close down my checking account and open up a new one, which resulted in me being charged by my gym and other other companies that had access to my account in order to subtract monthly bills. It was as if I had written them a bad check, something that I had never done in my life and now greatly questioned my credibility.  Please do not support these people, they are theives and on top of that the magazine is terrible and uncredible. I seriously hope that my review will help deter any and all people from subscribing to this magazine 
 The author does a good job with the character's in the book. He really drew me in. I kept reading to see what was going to happen and then ... nothing did. The character's were great but the plot wasn't there. I was waiting for a climax, then all the sudden I was on the last page. Frustrating, because it could've been really good 
 Our daughters are four and five years old.  The skates will not fit over our five year old's shoe.  The ad clearly says three to seven years old 
 A much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story.  The end was a disappointment and the middle laborious 
 After I read both the diet cure and the mood cure, I had the (dis)pleasure to meet Ms. Ross at her recovery center in Marin. It was awful. She has a prescribed plan that is one size fits all (for the most part). Her book is confusing and I'm not sure where the research is to back it up. She acts as a therapist, but she's not licensed. I wasted thousands of dollars in her program. She demands that you buy her supplements, see her nutritionists, do what she says otherwise she'll draw conclusions on you based on your unwillingness. She doesn't believe that people should have minds of their own, that they should following mindlessly according to her teachers.  I did her supplements. They made me sick (nauseous). I finally cut out her ridiculous plan and realized that I was fine the way I was. I would not reccommend this to anyone. If you are struggling with weight or body image, I'd encourage you to read "Overcoming Overeating," anything by Geneen Roth or "When Women Stop Hating Their Bodies. 
 joey pigza lit review        My lit circle book right now is not exciting because i don't like books but it doesn't make it a bad book to every one its just my opinion  but i would still recommend this to anyone who likes reading . Also this book would be a good book for anyone who might have a.d.d Cause joey also has a.d.d so for anyone this would be a book to read to relate to it. I  Would give this book a 0 if i could rate it cause it is kinda slow. . . . REALLY SLOW IN MY OPINION. This is a book for people who can sit still and read through a book.  wil 
 Time Enough For Love is one Heinlein's most famous books and is representative of his writing style, pacing and world view.  He touches upon many sociological subjects and tackles a number of interesting subjects and taboo mostly related to sex, incest the meaning of love.  That being said, after having his "big three" (Stranger In A Strange Land, The Moon is A Harsh Mistress and TEFL) I personally don't enjoy his work, I can understand why I'm in the minority.  TEFL follows the eternal Lazarus Long through his numerous adventures as he recounts his life while looking for reason to continue living.  The novel is divided up into four main sections uneven in length in quality.  There are times when Heinlein is right on target, examining social constructs, where they came from and how we deal with them.  Then there are times when there isn't much going on.  I think my two biggest problems with the novel were its structure and main character.  The makeup of the novel didn't lead to enough events happening nor did it produce any type of conflict normally needed to produce tension.  The novel is extensively dialogue driven and Shakespeare this is not.  Asimov got it right by mixing dialogue driven characters with at least some action but there is really very little going on in TEFL.  The one story that has some semblance of dramatic events (The Adopted Child) is clearly everyone's favorite.  As the main character Lazarus Long is lacking.  I kept drawing parallels between him and another famous fictional character: Lestat de Lioncourt from Rice's Vampire novels.  Both obviously share the immortal parallel but Lestat's personality and flaws made him much more interesting as a character.  Perhaps Long is a characterization of Heinlein himself and as we all know fiction is better then reality.  This book was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula in 1974.  A particularly amazing year with Clark's Rendezvous With Rama and Niven's Protector also in the mix.  Rendezvous is in a whole different playing field then the rest and won both awards hands down and deservedly so.  Bottom Line:  Maybe a must read for Heinlein aficionados and readers of classic sci-fi but this just doesn't work as social sci-fi for me.  Also the book is just too long 
 I ordered this book through a bookclub and returned it.  It was terrible!  Tanya Holland is a beautiful Black woman, but I feel has gone too far out of the way to create "innovative and different" recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food.  The price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook.  I collect african american/soul food cookbooks among others.  If you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent, your money would be better spent on "Essence Brings you Great Cooking" by Jonell Nash, "The Ebony Cookbook" by Freida DeKnight or "The Black Family Reunion Cookbook" by the The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in healthier soul food try, "The New Ebony Cookbook" by Charlotte Lyons or "The Family Dinner Quilt Cookbook" by The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in diverse, cultural flavors, I would recommend Vertamae Grosvenor's cookbooks or "Iron Pots and Wooden Spoons" by Jessica B. Harris.  I have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks.  They cover the gamut.  That is why I can give an honest opinion on Tanya Holland's book.  I just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average African American can relate to.  One that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking.  
 Even at a cheap price, its not worth it, spend a few $$$ more and get a better machin 
 Ihave always relied on Hewlett Packard to give me decent products so when I needed a new scanner, I went for this model, based on reports listed under CircuitCity.  Purchased this model at an Office Supply & it will be getting free trip back tomorrow for refund.   The software gives you NO options, starts loading up everything & anything on your pc while you sit & wait & wait.  Once loaded, I had programs that would not work properly plus it was very noisy when scanning a paper.  I uninstalled it & my programs are functioning perfectly once more.  HP, listen up, something is wrong with this model.  Give your customers better service, more options when loading software & only give us what we want....I want a basic, lost cost scanner to use about once a week, with no attached files. Stay away from this model unless you want your pc loaded with junk they feel you need 
 My apologies to all the Hemingway fans, but I didn't really care for this book. I had a hard time understand what was going on throughout the book. One bright spot was when they were in the mountains fishing and it is always nice to read of another country that is not yours. The characters did not appeal to me, I wouldn't want to party with any of them. They seemed lost and spoiled. Grabbing a quick peek at the Cliff Notes in a book store for this book; I found some of my conclusions were valid. But unfortunately it just wasn't for me. If you try this book I wish you luck 
 Firefighter is ranked more stressful than nursing?  Puhleeze! I've seen veteran firefighters crumble under the pressure of a moderately busy ER...  This book just perpetuates the...we are fed by the media.  The author should do himself a favor and actually STUDY some of the  research done about burnout levels and job satisfaction among the various professions.  The would be purchaser could do better for themself without buying this book 
 Sir, When you get yourself a degree then maybe just maybe I may think about buying this trash. Until that time from my readings PTSD has been tracked for over a century and a half ...so whats your problem?  Get rich  quick scams....only in America 
 I have been a fan of the Bee Gees for over 30 years and I was shocked to see this album released.  I was even more shocked to listen to the vocals.  They are dead and uninspired, no bee gee magic, just Robin in a monotone.  Why Robin would ever release this is beyond me.  The shawdows of the harmony and magic of the past is too large for Robin alone to fill.  I would post highlights but there are none.  Please Robin go back with Barry and return to the magic 
 I was so excited about this product.  I love simple appliances and this one fit the bill.  However the filters were impossible to find and the whole thing stopped working after a month of use!  Don't buy this product.  Spend the extra money and get a better humidifier 
 I can't believe the average customer review is greater than 4 stars! This book was a chore to read; I will admit that I could not drag myself throught he entire text. And I mean "text". This book was written like a textbook. I felt I back in college slogging through my required reading. This book was written as if someone did a whole bunch of research (using many different grad students of course), then tried to compile all the data into a book. The problem is, anybody can do that, but few can do that well. The writer loses the reader in all those details, forgeting to stick to the basics, highlight them with interesting examples, and repeat them often. I know she probably thinks she did this, and she did, just not well. I've never seen such an interesting topic made so boring 
 Leafing through every page of this famous book, I found it utterly useless for anyone who's vegetarian. Four of the meatless recipes were useful, though not particularly appealing in terms of taste. 
 I gotta admit I'm a bit surprised at how generously people are rating this album.  I bought it because people raved about it so much.  My wife and I listened to it on our drive to Indianapolis this weekend and ... we found it very lackluster.  I'm not saying all other reviews here are WRONG, I'm glad they enjoyed it.  However, this album pales in comparison to other works out there.  It simply doesn't measure up to the likes of Todd Barry or Mitch Hedburg.  Not even close.    It is an uncommonly clean album which is nice to see once in a while but I still just can't ignore that it didn't make me laugh much.  It went beyond being clean into JUST PLAIN NON-THREATENING and I wonder if that's what some like about it.  I would love to see more comedians out there who can do "clean" material that still sets people on edge.    As for this album, I simply can't recommend it.  It feels very dated even though it's only from 1997.  (Carlin has stuff from the 70s that feel TIMELESS.  That will never be the case with Regan's album.)  He is not the skilled writer or performer on par with other guys out there.  But that's my experience with the album.  IF it absolutely makes someone else's day brighter, that's great 
 There is frankly no 'truth' to be found in this publication.  Aside from the previously circulated speculation regarding Hillary Clinton's political aspirations and orentation, her knowledge of and duplicity inside the Lewinsky affair, and her march to the Senate, this work is void of anything but base conjecture and one-sided analyses which offer no depth and villify the women's movement in 21st century America at large.  I had the double misfortune of perusing this volume via CD.  The material is made far less credible by Mr. Klein's own wheezy and wet-sounding reading of his work.  I address this first because I am part of a large number of technoservants who spend 8-10 hours per day with no diversions during a monotonous coding job but for headphones, and I want explicitly to warn any readers from the audio version of this work.  It begins with an inane and unintentionally ridiculous buzzing sound from somewhere at the top of Klein's palate and carries on with sardonic emphasis placed on repeated terms such as:  'lesbianism', 'leftist' and 'aspiration'.  Spaced at roughly equal intervals (making one further question the very validity of research), Klein gleefully quotes Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, their aides and supporters, and the altogether too-rare addition of Clinton apoligists in making vulgar statements.  A professional narrator understands the proper treatment of the profanity that occurs (and is only attributed to the Clinton camp) in situations such as this, and Klein clearly does not.  Klein's very decision to narrate his own narrative is a poor one, and further displays the partisanship that he clearly wishes to convey with every written word of it.  As to the substance, and contrary to the title, there are no revelations about Mrs. Clinton contained anywhere within this narrative.  And I sincerely mean that - Klein has acheived no investigative credibility in simply regurgitating what is already known about the Senator.  The speculations regarding her sexuality (or, as Klein would argue, her very lack thereof), her role in Mr. Clinton's sexual escapades and the Lewinsky affair, and the politicking that took place in New York are either matters of public record or outright conjecture that would make Kenneth Starr look like a law-and-order hawk.    With reference to what the title leads the casual browser to believe is the centerstone of the book (what she knew about the Lewinsky affair), Klein does nothing but recirculate rumors and ideas that any half-informed person has already heard:  that Hillary knew about Bill's affair with Monica, that she did nothing to stop it, and even that she was reponsible (!!!) for it because it was her connections that lead to Lewinsky's entrance to the White House.  There is a contradictory juxtaposition here - Klein leads the reader on into this affair shortly after explaining that a young Hillary Rodham launched a verbal tirade against harrassment of interns while an intern herself.  Klein mistakenly presumes that everyone will nod at his faulty logic (that Hillary became the enabler of a concept she defames), yet it actually illustrates that Hillary is what she claims to be:  her own woman, independent of Bill himself.  As a disclaimer, I do not support Hillary Clinton.  I believe that she is a disengenuous person, willing to sacrifice her own rather confrontational ideas in favor of pursuit of public office.  But Klein makes this argument foolish.  His barely disguised anymosity for the Democratic party at large and his not-at-all disguised disdain for feminism which borders on outright sexism within this very narrative (he frequently charactarizes Hillary's crowd as a group of butch supporters of what HE has dubbed 'lesbianism') is nothing short of inane.  This narrative is poorly organized, and the silly quips with which he ends each of the far too numerous 'chapters' are representative of, well, nothing at all.  Possibly the saddest commentary I can offer is that this narrative is wrought with inconsitency on both an intellectual and factual level (as Klein altogether too often relies on sources who 'jumped ship' from the Clinton camp and he treats his conjecture as actual evidence, often citing 'facts' that are no more than his own speculation of Hillary's mindset), and has no organization to fall back on except the aforementioned large number of 'chapters'.  This work just rambles on and on while saying, well, nothing.  Finally, readers may chuckle to see that Klein has printed a number of glaring grammatical errors:  at one point he says that Hillary wore contact lenses that make her eyes 'bluer'.  In summation, this work needs to carry the disclaimer:  "Paid for by the Republican National Commitee" in exactly the same way the Michael Moore's "Faranheit:  911" needed a discalimer for the Democratic party.  That way the casual browser or, in my case, the frankly interested citizen preparing to make voting decisions for the 2008 primaries would just keep browsing.  There is nothing in Klein's work that suggests any effort on his part to search for the 'truth' he erroneously claims to offer; only the 'cut-and-paste' [... 
 Although this product may work with certain barking behaviours (for example: territorial barking, attention seeking etc), it can't be stressed enough that this is not a solution if your dog is suffering from Separation Anxiety. It does not deal with the reasons behind the barking. Instead, it just makes your pet even more anxious whilst you are gone and eventually intensifies the problem. Please check this fact before using this type of collar in order to avoid further negative developments 
 Joyce Carol Oates is my favorite author and I have been reading her since I was fourteen years old, but I'm very sorry to say this is the worst thing she's ever written. I won't state that there is automatically no legitimacy in a novel filled with characters whose personalities and weaknesses make them unlikable, but in this case the sheer revulsion I felt for each and every character infesting this book drove away my interest, empathy, and ultimately my desire to commit much I read here to long-term memory. From its anti-Semitism and ruined lives haunted by the past, to the cruelty and devious evil others within this short novel brought into the plot, I discovered little here that was either edifying or that worked well in generating expressions of wisdom sired by an ultimate understanding of what motivated each person in this painful story. Does this diminish Joyce Carol Oates in my regard, or will it make me reticent to read her works in the future? Absolutely not. The woman is a living treasure and I avidly await each new release of an Oates book. It's simply that in this case, she turned out a book I disliked past my ability to embrace it. 
 After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. I thought "finally, a book on communication between couples from a male perspective." I was expecting a sympathetic account of the communication between the sexes but such an account was missing in this book.  This book is s not meant for any man born after about 1960. The gender stereotypes are still very strong (both male and female).  The book starts with some helpful suggestions (don't criticise too often, set a time aside to share criticism) but then quickly deterriorates into a rant about how men have not been treated fairly in the media. Topics covered included abuse within the family (men are abused too) and male-bashing in greeting cards. One important missing topic from this list is the villification of men as pedofiles-- especially men who enjoy working with children.   Of course men can be abused by their wifes, and father's by their children but it does not mean that male on female violence is "okay". Rather than making the non-sensical argument that "we hurt too, so your hurt is fine," the author should condemn abuse in all it's forms. Similarly making fun of men just because they are men, is as okay as making fun of women just because they are women.   I have also wondered why there are very few programs for male perpetrators of violence. Most resources are for women, and the way to solve family abuse, is for the woman to leave. Where are the centres to help men communicate non-violently? Why can't the family try and heal together? In the first part of the book, the author identifies that female "fear" is often translated into male "aggression"-- good point, but why is this point not carried onto the discussion of abuse?  Then there is a list of traditional "unnoticed" male work, including being an unpaid bodyguard "in public places (who plays bodyguard when nightfall turns a beautiful park into a dangerous park", just as well a woman can be an "unpaid massager" for rubbing her husband's shoulders. Most of the other "male work" is incredibly gender specific and even a quick read makes it clear that these are special events (putting up the Christmas lights) rather than day-to-day toil. I found this list offensive. We both cook dinners, use the barbaque and put up the Christmas lights.  There is also the male role of "option generating"-- man asks where they should go for dinner, woman says "anywhere", man says "italian?" etc. Apparently "option-generating often involves having one's ideas rejected, which can be emotionally taxing." The beauty of being in a couple is that both parties can create options and both can reject. It's called communication and making choices together.  More than that, I find it offensive that the author glosses over all the important work men do in families. Men now do change diapers, take pride in being fathers, cook, clean and are partners also in the home. How has this development passed the author by? By enforcing the gender stereotype of "the man brings in the bacon", the author is also glossing over all the men, who might like to stay at home with their children... or who would like to work part-time to have more family time. As well as of course all the women, who might like to have a career.  Many of these choices should be made in the family. Gender stereotypes are truly just as damaging to men, especially because they limit the choices that can be considered "acceptable". Why can a man not enjoy spending time with his children? Why does he need to be able to support the family? Should the responsibility not be shared? Where are the men, who are single parents? Male kindergarten teachers? Heaven forbid.  One more irritating passage: "We often think that when a man insults another man by calling him a 'girl', the insult reflects a contempt for women. No. It reflects a contempt for any man who is unwilling to make himself strong enough to protect someone as precious as a woman." hmmm. yeah... hmmm. This is where I started to laugh out loud. Too ridiculous for words.  In short: this book is not for anyone, who is trying to be a father in this century. Rather than solving anything, this book just perpetuates detrimental and dangerous gender stereotypes. Perhaps the author lives in this kind of a world (and indeed much of the material seems to stem from his personal experiences), but I don't know any young man who would... Rather young men now are facing the same challenges of work-life balance as young women are.  It's time to get beyond male-hating and female-hating, juxtaposing male needs and female needs to find somekind of a inherent conflict, and to understand that men and women can live together. And that in a family, men and women have the same goal-- of making their families as happy as they can. 
 The author of this book had a chance to say something insightful and profound about California's recent past and its future, but he failed to do that.  Instead he just rehashed arguments that he made in his last book, "Paradise Lost," which wasn't as bad as this one.   One of the most annoying things about this book is how Schrag uses quotes from academics when what the academics say is common knowledge.  In these cases, Schrag shows his background as a newspaper man, but it is to his detriment.  Don't read this book unless you have to for school (like me 
 At first I thought this book was a wonderful learning tool and good story for my newborn son. However, the reference that some parents 'come the same' and the picture of a lesbian couple walking with a little girl was very inappropriate for an adoption book. Why do homosexual references need to be in a CHILDREN'S book??? This only opens up the opportunity for a young child to ask an awful lot of questions about same sex relationships, perhaps BEFORE a parent is ready to discuss. I will not be reading this book again 
 This isn't much about trading or Christianity.  More about this guy's somewhat unusual life story.  A nice little read but it won't rock your world.  What I found interesting was the unresolved issue of what happened to the people who lived before the time of Christ, when Ritchie was raised to believe that salvation only comes through Christ.  This is a perplexing question for a Christian who believes this--it certainly says something about the nature of God as such or the belief structure which holds this as a tenet.  
 If this were a satirical view of Regency books, I might have bought the far-fetched storyline, the flat, idiotic characters, and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot.  As I rather suspect it is not a satire - Catherine Coulter being a best-selling Romance novelist - it was disappointing to say the very least.  I only, I repeat, only listened to it in its entirety because I hadn't brought anything else to listen to at work one day.  If you like historical romance that's fun and funny, try Katie MacAlister's book "Improper English", or for some more serious historical fiction, check out Phillippa Gregory's Wideacre series 
 Maybe at the time it was written I would have reviewed it more favorably. In light of the life Miller led I can't help but to be disappointed by the cheap commericialization of the socialist superiority over capitalist theme that permeates the play. Here Miller creates a character only to destroy that character to point out the ills of capitalism, then Miller spends the rest of his life living an indulgent capitalist life here in the good ole USA: the very capitalist society that was supposedly Willy's oppressor. I think the years have taken the shine off of Miller a bit. I'm sure the Liberal 101 literature professor will disagree 
 Carly's book was "ok". She cries alot, triumphs, and blames many around her. This one is definitely skippable 
 Michael Moore Hates America. This is evident in all of his movies and also proven when he goes oversees to make money by badmouthing us here at home. If you want to waste your money to see a film so horribly slanted in his own opinion, with quotes taken out of context...then by all means buy this collection. If you want to really find out what Michael Moore is up to...go to Moorelies.com...or read "Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man." You can find the book here at Amazon.com and I promise it will be a better way to spend your hard earned money. 
 this movie suffers from being moronically and mind numbingly pathetic and stupid. Jerry O'Connell (tv's Sliders, tv's Crossing Jordan), Ryan Reynolds (The In-LAws, tv's Two Guys a Girl and A Pizza Place) and Bill Bellamy (Love Stinks, Tv's Fastlane) are friends. O'Connell has a graphic design company and has a lovely girlfriend, Bridgette Wilson (House On Haunted Hill, Love Stinks) but work gets in the way, which force the both of them to experiment in dating others. Reynolds tries to cope with the fact that he is becoming gay. It's, its just an awful movie and it really suffers from mad cow diesease, litterally. Reynolds shouldnt of done that scene from Silence OF The Lambs, NO! that was wrong! Ron Livingston (Office Space, Swingers) shouldnt of been in this movie and he just looks too much like Jon Tenney's (HomeGrown, Fools Rush In) older brother. Alyssa Milano (Poison IVy 2, FeaR) has bad choices in movies now. Also starring Kevin Weisman (tv's Alias, tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Annabeth Gish (tv's X-Files, SLC Punk), Fiona Loewi (senior Trip, Love and Death On Long Island) and a weird appearace by John O'Hurley (best known for portraying Elaine Bennetts boss on Seinfeld), you know the guy, "my buddies call me Timbo" , it was just too much and it is a forgettable movie. Steer clear from this junk. The title song in the beginning Jerry O'Connell sang in Scream 2. 
 You might want to take the author's viewpoint into consideration when deciding whether or not to purchase this book. For example, on page 133, he says, 'I use no gods, except the concept of a creative source. In my religion, there are only three people: Me, myself, and I.&quot 
 This book has caused more misery than all the wars ever. Anybody who believes in it deserves to burn eternally in the hell they have created with their metaphysical mumbo-jumb 
 if you like this book, more power to you. i wish you well. but, please: shame on the modern library editorial board for choosing this thing as the 8th greatest novel of the 20th century! ridiculous. there is nothing special about the writing, and the whole book is such a heavy-handed ideological sermon, that it is more like a dark dreary pondorous cartoon i wish i had taken no part of. if you like ugly literature, this will be for you.                 
 A fascinating topic, not helped by a desultory and superficial presentation. The field is inviting: politics, perhaps one of the great venues for projection, begs psychological insight. It's obviously extraordinarily difficult to produce the kind of insight which does justice to the field. This book's problem is not its prose, which is o.k. Rather, it exemplifies the great problem that attends to such analyses: it resorts to assertion rather than data and thus becomes a long document of personal opinion. One may agree, or not, but ultimately this seems less interesting and less satisfying 
 The Book of Nothing was much better. I am surprised at errors made on simple physical realities. Eclipse of sun is defined as earth's shadow covering sun's disc...  Sun's light reaching earth in 3 seconds... As one reviewer already mentioned, letter used for "1" is indistinguishable from "I"... I could not find much detail on "constants", just speculations and what if's... Quotes sprinkled all over are much more fun to read.. 
   I got this book from the library, after having taken out, and IMMENSELY enjoyed other books with similar themes by Indian, and/or Indian-American authors, like Kavita Daswani, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Amulya Malladi.      I might have enjoyed this book, and I could have thought it was a good book, if only the author, and the publishers had considered the print and style when printing the books.      What I am referring to, is that in this book, EVERY SINGLE new paragraph is preceded by a long hyphen (dash) which was EXTREMELY distracting, and made it VERY difficult for me to get through what may or may not have been a very good book.      The hyphen (dash) that I am speaking of is this, for example:      - She said, "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda". Then she went out to blah blah blah.      - He said "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda".Then he went out to blah blah blah.       - They said "Blah, blah blah, yadda yadda yadda".Then they went out to blah blah blah.         Because of this distracting form of typing, I was barely able to get past the first dozen or so pages.       It sounded like a very interesting book, but unfortunately I couldn't get past the constant hyphens. I'm sure its probably even harder for those with dyslexia, and other reading impairments as well as poor eyesight.      Maybe in the future, the author and publisher could think of this and maybe print the books just like other normal, regular books.    Then maybe I'd try reading it again.

 The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.  This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.  Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer.  
 The author borrows from several world belief systems and tries to pass them off as ancient "toltec" wisdom.  It does contain sprinklings of common sense, but the common sense is offset by impractical application as well as impractical implications.  Furthermore, the author contradicts himself at times.  On the other hand, if you are a fan of Deepak Chopra you will probably like this book as it is in the same vein.  
 "Two Virgins" lives up to its title--it sounds like it was created by someone with absolutely no musical experience at all. While I'm a big fan of Lennon's Beatles and post-Beatles solo albums (even the weakest Lennon album "Sometime in New York City" has its minor moments), I found this completely unlistenable and a waste of 30 minutes of my time.   Is "Two Virgins" misunderstood? If it is it's because it's in an incomphrensible musical langauge. The cover was the only thing this album was notable for--a nude portrait of a couple who had found love. It created controversy (EMI didn't want to distribute it). As avant-garde its too simplistic as music it's a disaster. Avoid unless you must have everything (including every fart, belch and toe nail trimming) from Lennon 
 silly and insipid, and as grand as the resurrected animation department at disney was from "little mermaid" thru "aladdin" and "lion King" and "beauty & the beast", crud like this only reminded one of the era od "the black cauldron". 
 Author couldn't seem to find much to talk about, only 30 pages prior to his discussion of biblical times. He manages to sidestep a lot of charged topics though, simply by leaving them out. The style of writting is both readable and enjoyable and the book itself is engaging. Unfortunatly it leaves out 90% of us humans who are not from that particular tradition in the "west." If you want a book that will reinforce the western centracism by all means read it 
 Like other reviewers, after careful research, I decided to purchase this product. It was affordable, received good reviews, and was of bigger size than others in the similar price range. When I received it in mail, I was quite happy: it worked great out of the box and it looked even nicer than what I had expected. The screen was bright and very attractive.   The problems started about three weeks following the purchase. First, the slideshow option (the kind with music) stopped working. Whenever I pushed the slideshow button, the screen would completely freeze and I had to restart the unit in order to use any other function. I thought, no big deal, I would just exchange the frame for another one.  My second unit arrived yesterday. This one, however, started having problems right out of the box. After about 5 minutes into the slideshow, the screen started flickering, than shaking, became completely staticky and finally it re-started automatically. I played it two more times after that, each time with a similar thing happening 10 or 15 minutes into the slideshow.  It is obvious this photoframe has a lot of potential (big, bright screen); unfortunately, the software is very buggy. I checked the Portable USA website and it does not appear that they have any patches that could be downloaded as a fix. I will have to return this unit again, this time for a refund.  My assumption is that this product has received many positive reviews because people like it after they initially open the box. However, I would be curious to learn if others have had a similar experience after several weeks or months of ownership 
 The best I can describe this book is as "A Half Baked Cake". However hard a cook might have tried to get the best ingridients, and the right temperature in the oven, the best techniques for baking...but if the time the cake is left in the oven is less than needed, what you get is a "Half Baked Cake",and this is exactly what this book is.  The author wanted to get someting out qucik...so she quickly huddled up to get some information, and as it goes in the modern day media, thrown in some controversy, and chances are you may become a best seller...well this looks like a failed attempt to become a best seller.....its more a work for fiction than research, an academician or researcher is more honest and persistent in her approach...this is a failed attempt at gaining cheap popularity.  Save yourself a few lattes and cappacinos...that would be a better you of your hard earned $$$...don't make this lazy author rich 
 I was required to read this book for my grad work in Urban Education. This book reads like a manual for elementary through junior high school Arts teachers--I am a Secondary Math teacher so it didn't work quite so well for me. As far as direct content, very detailed examples (too detailed for me). A lot of picking apart the most basic phrases. Felt like only using the language discussed would be condescending to high school students and afraid that saying a million variations of "good job" would cause the praise to lose meaning 
 I LUV FALL OUT BOY!!!!!!!!!  AWL SONGS GET 10 OUTTA 10!!!!!!  DESERVS ALL 6 STARSS!!! 
 If you use PPG paint, there's nothing there for you. They make painting sound so complicated that you'll want to take your car to a shop. Constantly mentioning supplied air respirators etc... When have you ever seen a painter in a scuba outfit? I know the fumes aren't good for you, but come on 
 I am very enthusiastic about exposing my children to different cultures and ideas, and when I saw this book and read the reviews on Amazon, I was excited to get it for my girls.  When the book arrived, I read it immediately.  The story and the pictures are beautiful.  I liked everything until the very last sentence of the book -- I was very surprised to read that Yeh-Shen's stepmother and stepsister were "crushed to death in a shower of flying stones."  Although I understand that this may be part of the original story, I am giving this book one star because it is supposed to be appropriate for children 4-8.  I don't believe, with such a violent and disturbing ending, that it is appropriate for this age group 
 The difference between cant and deceit is that the peddler of cant believes his own nonsense.  In this case, the cant begins with the very title "the Jewish New Testament". Jews have one ONE (1) Testament: it's called the Tanakh by Jews and the "Old Testament" by Christians. If you accept the "New Testament" as sacred scripture, you are (intellectually) not a Jew anymore but something else.    I would use the same argument if the roles were reversed --- if this were, say, an ex-Catholic convert to Judaism arguing that one can reject half the Nicean creed, downgrade the "New Testament" to literature-plus, and still be an evangelical Christian. One cannot.   Let Jews be Jews (although some might wish to learn a bit more about what makes believing Christians tick), and let Christians be Christians (although they may wish to learn more about the Jewish roots of their own faith --- commendably, an increasing number are). Each serving G-d in their own way.  To use a Jewish metaphor: Judaism is like meat and Christianity like dairy. Each, prepared according to the relevant rules, is kosher in itself, but mixtures of meat and dairy are always TREIF (nonkosher) 
 This one's a pass. Starts with some blah-blah-blah about warrior mystique with quotes obviously approved by the public affairs department. Follows with mostly sterile description of battles in the manner of "this division went up the mountain, got repulsed, regrouped and then destroyed the enemy. Then this other division..." These battles are supposed to be stirring but all we get here is a mind-numbing list of names, events and dates 
 The classification of dog "types" didn't resemble anything I've learned in other books on dog breeds.  I'm not aware that dogs are either clever or friendly, but not both at the same time. How would one choose a pet?  Let's see, do I want a stupid friendly dog, or a dog who is very clever but aloof and indifferent to me?  A big disappointment was the section where the author shared his intense dislike of cats and their owners.  What does this have to do with the title and theme of his book and why should any of us care? Dr Coren, for unknown reasons, finds it necessary to express his admiration and love of dogs by bashing cats with the same old tiresome comparisons that are always unfavorable to cats. If this was necessary, then why not include a chapter listing all the ways that guinea pigs, gerbils, parakeets, and tropical fish fall short when compared with dogs? Better yet, let's have an expert on rabbit breeding write a book about taking care of rabbits, and then include a chapter describing the faults and inadequacies of dogs? After reading much of this book,I find it hard to believe that Coren really likes any animals. I wonder whether he needed additional ncome and thought he had a new angle for a dog book.  As a lover of both dogs and cats, I have no trouble realizing that they are two different species that require no comparisons. The author's decision to share the story of the woman who seemed indifferent when her cat went missing is supposed to prove that even people who choose cats for pets, don't really love them the way the author loves dogs.  Is Coren really unaware that there's a surplus of uncaring PET owners who neglect dogs as well as cats? I don't know what Coren's grudge against the cat owning woman in his book is all about, but it tells us nothing about what cats are like as pets!    Coren thinks cats are seldom seen during the day.  He would enjoy meeting my cat, who along with our dog, greets people at the door, follows us from room to room and cuddles with us on the couch at all times of the day or evening.  Mr Coren, let the real dog and cat experts write the books.Your time would be better spent developing some insight into your own anger and resentments 
 I can't get what peeps find so good with this so terrible CD of the Ex Westlifer Brian McFadden. It may appear many lack the musical/emotional sensitivity nowdays, thinking everything is great, how sad. After somebody gave it to me, and one so unbearable listen, I just threw it away, found Brians voice, lyrics, music and all some of the worst heard to date, and to top it off the horrid Duett with Delta Goodrem whom I'm fan of, just total disgusted and saddened me beyond words - This is typical Brian as he did to the poor Atomic Kitten member, not too long ago. All the Rumours regarding Delta & Brian should be treated as empty air, as how insensitive the media is nowdays - No match in Heaven!. And hope that this so totally untalented Ex Westlifer will never put out another Album again, and never sing with the OZ Sweetheart ever again,as she doesnt deserve to be made so dirty by this horrible Brian McFadden with his so dark past, and this so bad CD also shows, noticing his poor songwriting on the sideline just too clearly. A very bad CD of a very bad singer, that should not have been...Very sad! 
 I wish I had known this pamphlet (definitely not a book) was only 15 very sparse pages long because I would not have ordered it.  The word descriptions of actions to be taken are very hard to understand with no sketches or photos.  It seems more like  a book review or outline of a book that is yet to be written 
 The book is interesting and has viable principles -- but they're principles found in many other books over the years.  It would have been a good resource about 15 years ago.  Needs fresh approach 
 This is honestly one of the worst films (I use this term loosely) I have ever sat through. A past review said it was good script, I can't believe there was a script. Between all the uh's and um's that come out of the "actors" mouths, one would have to think they were coming up with the dialogue as they went along. This is the unfortunate downside of a time when anyone with a DV recorder and Final Cut can make a movie and put it out. True, it allows many unknown artists the opportunity to realize their vision without the help of some corporate mega-studio giving them the go ahead, but on the other hand, you might end up having to watch something called "Firecracker". Do yourself a favor, stare at a wall for an hour and a half instead 
 My wife got me Outside Fitness for Christmas knowing I enjoy the magazine and am working on getting back into shape. What she didn't realize is that I have actually been getting more and more disapointed in Outside magazine. Quality is slipping as they are trying to compete with various new "mens"magazines none of which appeal to me. Well Outside Fitness is severely lacking too. It was a nice idea and could have been great. Also, this book like a previous reviewer has already said, could definitely use some heavy editing. Be nice if it were like the old Outside magazine - Be nicer if Outside Magazine were like its old self 
 Butterfly Stories is pretentious and overwritten creating a writing style that presents the reader with prose that is obscure for obscurity's sake.  This was a most annoying and unfulfilling reading experience.  Similar to some of Vollman's other work - this novel is primarily about a man developing unhealthy attachments to prostitutes with Vietnam and the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia as background.  Unfortunately the writing style is so overblown it gets in the way of good story telling. 
 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 For some great advice email me at humorgirl86@hotmail.com. I have owned a cockatiel for 8 years and have alot of expierience. This book is informative on housing, feeding, breeding and healing. It has great  pictures but, it's not the pictures that make the book it's the words! It  doesn't go into great detail about everything. It hardly has a page on  training and that doesn't even help if at all. Sure it may seem good but  once you read it, it really isn't that good at all. I say that you should  go to the pet store or book store and actually read the book or scan it to  make sure that it has what you want. Petsmart and Petco are great pet  stores that have plenty of books and all the needs for a cockatiel 
 This desk is okay if you don't move it around, but if you move it the desk part ,that is attached to the chair, it moves and then kind of rubs on the chair leaving marks 
 THIS ALBUM IS OKAY NOT THEIR BEST. A FEW SONGS ARE GOOD OTHER THAN  THAT THIS ALBUM  IS FAIR.PURCAHSE IT WITH YOUR MONEY INTELLIGENTLY!!!!!!!! 
 This is a none-scientific book. It is based on basic common sense ideas. Eat less and excercise. Dah! We already knew that 
 I'm not an ardent supporter of the present government in Iran, but I have an issue with the cover of this book and its title: "We Are Iran, Today Real Iranians." If the people who are depicted on the cover of this book are Iran, then where are the rest of the population who do not live in the tony sections of northern Tehran, do not drink cappuccino and do not look so hip? What is this book trying to say: that Iranians actually look and act like Westerners; that they are actually a "civilized" nation and what's happening in Iran has nothing to do with the "real" Iran? That ordinary, everyday women of Iran who do not sip cappuccino, dress in traditional customs are not Iran? I don't think so. Iran is much more than these people. The people on the cover belong to La-la land 
 Before I saw this movie I was warned that is was anti-Christian and that the writers of the screenplay didn't have a clue as to what following Christ is really all about.  After seeing the movie I am convinced of the latter but only somewhat of the former.   Mandy Moore does a great job playing a legalistic, "church-lady" type named Hilary,  who goes beyond "witnessing" in her attempts at converting others by using crisis intervention tactics--like blocking the hallways with her and her friends, or attempting to kidnap the subject and throwing him/her into their van for treatment.  For Hilary, Christianity is all about behavior modification.  She lacks heart winds up with bitterness.  Her only hope at the end comes from her wheelchair bound brother, a nonbeliever, who offers to help her with her problems.  One can only assume that rather than correcting her misperceptions of Jesus, he will instead try to deprogram her of her faith.   Hilary's nemesis, who she constantly tries to convert, is Cassandra, played by Eva Amurri.  Cassandra, a Jewish girl determined not to convert, brings to mind Matthew 13:19.  She has heard the Word and "understandeth it not" as a person who received the "seed" by the wayside.  She becomes a hero in the end for having a big heart, though she still chooses the earthly path rather than the spiritual one, thinking she only needs to rely on herself.   Mary, played wonderfully by Jena Malone for her innocence, seems to turn against God a bit too easily when in trouble (see Matthew 13:21).  Blaming God when it was she who forgot to bring protection along seems very shortsighted for a girl with such strong willed faith.  But many young Christians do feel persecuted when they don't get what they pray for, a sign of spiritual immaturity.   The problem with this movie is that no one has spiritual maturity, including the writers of the screenplay.  Even the most sinful pastor will answer "YES" when asked by a young gay teenager, banned from prom night, if Jesus still loves him.  This one doesn't know what to say.  There are no answers given to the audience of this film, most of whom are young people looking for answers.  So I will give a short one here.   Saint Augustine said something that at first sounds irresponsible when not fully understood.  He said "Love God, and then do as you please."  What he meant is that when we really love Jesus intensely for who He is and what he sacrificed for us, our hearts will change.  Sinful behavior we used to commit no longer has the same appeal to us as before.  Being obedient to God brings us pleasure when we have true love and devotion to Christ.  We are still sinners but no longer by desire--not perfect but forgiven.  Would it have been so difficult to include just one character at a Christian school who mentions this?  The difficulty lies in finding screenwriters in Hollywood who have a clue about it.  Don't get me wrong.  All of the characters in this movie were essential!  But they forgot the most essential of all 
 I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character.  Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me.   2 star 
 Director Michael Bay had some good ideas about blowing stuff up but absolutely no clue as to structuring an interesting, intelligent and engaging story. Even with blatently ripping off the far superior Tora! Tora! Tora! he still manages to produce this amazingly boring and inept clunker.   Why Hollywood has to shoehorn love stories into every second movie regardless of their subject matter is beyond me. Let's see Micheal Bay do a film with a love triangle about the atomic bomb. Couldn't get much worse than this. You can comfortably fast forward through three quaters of this movie and not miss much.   The second star is for blowing stuff up. Overall not a fine example of film making 
 Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Not recommended.  In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, "I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is," ". . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age," and ". . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must." Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.  Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, "A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.  When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as "woman" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the "living," no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.  Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as ". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot," he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.  Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, "If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep." On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren't in "lock step," Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including "the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers"), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.  Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. When a friend says, "A boy can break your heart . . . He's so damned beautiful! And so cruel!" Miller writes, "We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earnest." When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, "At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good."  Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, " . . . they must be saturated with my anguish," the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. He describes artists such as himself as the "inhuman ones." "I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on." Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger.  Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). Shapiro says, "There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America." If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his "art," his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the "greatest" of these souls, may I never meet the least.  Note: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it 
 This is still to this day one of the most aweful films i ever saw. I took a girl ona  date for this movie and wow, what a mistake. The movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more. 
 This book is merely a device for Mr Comfort's personal preferences. Armpit hair, personal odors etc. He also uses French phrases freely with no explanation of what they mean. This book seems to give permission to have and enjoy sex to readers who are well beyond the 'is it ok to...?" stage. Not sensual, not a turn on or inspirational. Even though the drawins are well done, they seem almost clinical as does the information 
 My first Philippa Gregory book was "The Queen's Fool"  which I throughly enjoyed.  I could not waited to have time to sit and read!  So as I was towards the end of "The Queen's Fool" I began to see what other books were available by this author.  I bought "The Virgin's Lover" since to seemed to follow "The Queen's Fool".  Within the first 36 pages, I was completely frustrated at the layout of the novel.  TOO MUCH BOUNCING ABOUT WITH THE TIME FRAME.  And the time frames within the book do not match those in "The Queen's Fool".  For instance, in "The Queen's Fool"  Queen Mary dies in Winter 1558 but in "The Virgin's Lover" The Queen dies in Autumn 1558.  Another example is Lord Robert.  In "The Queen's Fool" Lord Robert lives at St. James Palace (Autumn 1558) and presses Queen Mary to name an heir (Winter 1558).  However, in "The Virgin's Lover" Lord Robert is low man in court with no where to go but to his wife's StepMother's.                                                                   I think part of the problem with this type of time framing is the use Seasons.  Winter 1558....is this November December or January February?  Because further in the book the use of Winter 1558-59 is used. The back and forth at the beginning of the book set me up to confusion a few later chapters into the book.  I spent more time concentrating on keeping the time frame correct then actually enjoying the book which must be quite evident by now with me taking the time to write this review 
 Mr. Khekoyan, who reviews this disk below, is quite correct that it is errant in tempi and in percussive interpretation. I'm not in agreement with him about Glenn Gould's stature as the foremost interpreter of Bach of the century. I'd suggest listening to the performance of Menno van Delft, which is included in the Bach Edition complete works produced by Brilliant Classics. There are any number of people who might nominate Gustav Leonhardt, Trevor Pinnock, or Bob van Asperen as more insightful interpreters of Bach than Glenn Gould. Don't let Gould's curious cult status mislead you; his performances are more quirky than competent. Or, if you are attracted to the Art of Fugue rather than the Artist, you might listen to the performance of the Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet, also available on CD. Though there is no historical justification for playing Bach's harpsichord music on recorders, the LSQ makes fine and insightful music on their wooden flutes, large and small. At times they sound more organistic than Mr. Gould on his modern behemoth 
 My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.   The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.  That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.   And  no, I do not believe there was any such child. 
 I have enjoyed Baldacci's work before but this book was simply awful.  I couldn't believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible.  I was very surprised to get such stilted writing from Baldacci.  You can miss this one in my opinion 
 I love AITF. Always have. And was very excited about the fact that 'it' was going to be available on DVD. It was - as most of us know - a 'landmark' TV show. It changed TV. But what a shame. The picture quality of the DVD is absolutely horrible. NO better - in fact - than the VHS tapes I have of the show. [that I taped myself] And what excuse is there for no 'extras'? Compared to other 'complete seasons' - like the 'Mary Tyler Moore Show' or 'Here's Lucy' [among others] the AITF is a disgrace. Even the box it comes in is done on the cheap. Without question - AITF should have been [at least] digitally remastered. 'All in the Family' is a 5-star show. 'The complete third season' is a 2-star effort. [at best] I have no idea what the first and second season are like - but I already feel as though I've been robbed - and am not about to make that mistake again 
 This book describes Cameroon as the armpit of Africa. Seriously. It said that. At least 1/3 of the book is on all the different types of diseases one is sure to catch being there. It says that Cameroon is unique in that there is a type of malaria that will KILL you in 24 hours of the first symptom. This book scared me so much that I went to Egypt alone instead of going with my friends to Cameroon. There arent really any books just on Cameroon. Lonely Planet has one on West Africa which I should have gotten. My friends went and had a wonderful time. The book should have talked about the good things this country has- which as it turns out there are other things there that Malaria! Perhaps if I would of read a different book then I would have not canceled my flight to Cameroon. 
 This book focuses way too much on disputing irrational self-defeating thoughts such as putting yourself down for not being able to stop drinking. The books answers your self-defeating thinking with such retorts as "prove it" over and over again. This book is also very ambiguous with confusing statements like this one all throughout the book.  QUOTE FROM BOOK... " If you only believe you don't want to be deprived of alcohol, would you then believe that life without it is awful? Usually not. If you believe, however, that you must not be deprived, you can easily think that abstinence is awful. If you only don't want discomfort, would you then believe that you can't stand it? Probably not. You may, however, think that you can't stand it when you believe that you must not have discomfort."  huh......?????? what?????  That's how this whole book is written. Also, there's too much emphasis put on how great a feeling alcohol is. That's dangerous thinking for someone looking to get away from it. For someone who has been drinking for many years, the feeling is not that great anymore. This book put ideas in my head that really weren't there before. It focuses way too much on assuming you put yourself down constantly for not being able to quit drinking. I never really thought like that. There are better books out there. This one just didn't work for me 
 Amie:"I would say this book is a little less than average. I enjoyed the book Angel Medicine much more. The Angels seemed so much more peaceful and loving in her previous books which makes me think they are merely a projection of what the author is feeling at the time. Are they angels or inner thoughts and how can one really tell?"    I have reason to believe they are far more tilted towards herself than angels.  Whether reading this book or going to her site angeltherapy.com you will find a community message board where anything that you write that does not support her position, she or her admin team will immediately and high handedly delete.  I've seen postings on this site that says if you question her or her affiliates the admin will take you down.  Now consider the topic of this book & what she is writing about.  Thats not exactly Angelic, is it?  The reason I mention her site on angeltherapy.com is because you clearly see further evidence of what Amie says --  That the writings come far more from her than from Angels.  Why include all this on Amazon.com?  Very simple!  A genuine message from Angels is something I myself would like to read.  Having explored the evidence I really dont think this book is as much Angelic communication as much as it is Doreen communication.  If your looking for Authentic Angelic communication you may have to look this book over a little more carefully 
 This book is disgustingly slanted toward the position of the pro-Isreali's. Each page is becomes more blatent. It's impossible for any book to be completely void of bias, but Randall Price doesn't even make an effort to lay out the facts and let the reader draw their own conclusion. It's just riduculous. I usually buy my books instead of borrowing from the library in order to support the authors; but take my advice and save you money with this one.  That is, of course, unless your mind is already made up and you simply want to feel better about your obstinance. 
 This game is ok, entertains my children for a little while.  I thought everything was ok, but then, after only a couple of months, the cartridges started to malfunction!  We have two leap pads and some games work in one, but not the other (and visa versa!)  For the price, I don't want the toy to not work 1/2 the time after only a few uses.  The books seem to hold up pretty good, but the cartridges don't.  And, at a price of around $12 each, I was very dissapointed.  If the cartridges worked all the time, I would probably give this toy 4 stars, as it is fun (when it works) and portable.  One last comment for improvement, would be to have the volume be on the outside, not in the book, as the regular volume is a bit too loud and I have to ask my little one to turn it down each time she switches books/cartridges 
 I played this at a friend's party, and it was a wretched party game. It basically consists of a person reading the puzzle in a monotone voice and allowing everyone else to attempt to figure it out. It is incredibly monotonous, and a throughly awful game to play at a party.  I admire its cleverness. It took a lot of creativity and know-how to make up these challenging puzzles. But for the sake of all your guests, I emplore you: Hide this boring game. Hide it as well as possible.  The painful thing is that out of a choice between Mad Gab and Lost: The Game my friend chose Mad Gab. It's sad, really 
 This book takes what can be a great experience and McPilgrim's it . . . The writing is wooden, and the depth is about as thick as the meat on one of those teeny basic hamburgers. The only reason you would read this is to get a list of sites you may want to research elsewhere.  For travel to sacred sites, see such well-written and inspiring books as Phil Cousineau's Art of Pilgrimage and Sarah York's Pilgrim Heart -- don't waste your money on this one 
 Berkhof's Systmatic is of course a classic text that is a gem.  I had the old Banner Of Truth edition for years but like a dope sold it for pennies on the dollar.  This edition from Eerdmans is truly abominable.    Where do I start?  First off, the font size is terrible.  So if you are over 58 the eye strain is quite significant.  Then comes the print type.  It is almost as if someone churned out copies in his garage.  The printing is extremely bad.  Sentences contain words that after a letter or two turn light and then dark and in a few instances downright smudgy.  Was the typeset dirty?  Did you run out of ink?  True, this edition contains Berkhof's introductory section which is a bonus.  But what good is it if the production quality is abysmal?  How unfortunate that such a magnificient work is so insulted.   Mr. Publisher, check out Shedd's Dogmatic Theology by P and R Publishers.  That is how one presents a text of significance.    If you have the Banner Of Truth edition do not trade it in lest you rue the day.     
 The Melting Pot has worked for 200+ years. Just because an Invasion of Illegals has broken our borders,our prisons,our hospitals,our schools, laughed at our laws and is now marching in our streets Tamar thinks they should dictate our Immigration policy as well.   History has labeled people like her "Usefull Fools". 
 The most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone. The movie is a Nokia product placement, highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and, conversely, what a phone can do for you if you have one. The plot centers on Jessica (Kim Basinger) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need. Mystery #1: What is it?   After lots of running/driving in various parts of L.A. the bad guys round up Jessica's family, while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them. Mystery #2: how will the cell phone save the day?  Mystery #3. Watch for the credits at the end of the film. They show up on a...? Yep, you got it 
 This system does an adequate, but not great, job of decoding digital S/PDIF audio with volume adjust for center, surround, and subwoofer.  It has several simple digital decode modes.  A fair value for $100, but if I had to do it again, I would prefer a lower end home theatre receiver with speakers, which often start around $150.  These speakers show significant distortion at fairly modest volume levels.  However, they are adequate sound for my small home office at lower volumes 
 This item was offered as a suggested accessory to the Nikon Monarch ATB 8X42 Waterproof Binoculars that I purchased.  I later also purchased the 12X42 Binoculars.  This harness CAN NOT be attached to either pair of binoculars!  The hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars.  Other than that the harness is a well made quality product 
 Ah yes, HIM started to go downhill after and with this one.  This one I acquired after getting Razorblade Romance, Love Metal and Greatest Lovesongs, and I was quite surprised that I hadn't ever heard of this one.  I got it, rushed home to listen to it, and I did, and I have been revisiting that horrid memory every time I listen to those few songs I liked in this one.  "Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights" marks the beginning of HIM's descent into mellower, less moody, wasted-potential music, which they later described as "love metal" when it had lost all connection with what it used to be.  This album also marks the start of "Ten Songs Per Album" rule of HIM, guaranteeing what will most likely be a short and catastrophic listen.  "Heartache Every Moment", "Pretending", "Love You Like I Do".  That's it.  The rest of the album sounds like it has been taken out of some dreamy pop album with electric guitar and overall too much acoustic and cheery melodies, complete with all songs regarding love or loss thereof, as usual, however, without the edge they delivered in Greatest Lovesongs and Razorblade Romance.  This album takes a lot of getting used to, simply because it takes for you to get used to the idea HIM could have gotten this dreamy and cheerful.  Like I said, after this, the band went downhill, with the brief interruption of "Love Metal" 
 That is an understatement, This book is the worst excuse for book I have ever seen. This book isent even worthy for kindling. "Ed Marshel" Must know knothing about Management let alone 1st Grade grammer. My younger  brother has written more decisive pices on doodle-pape 
 If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point.  Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated.  He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory.  Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 This book was a great disappointment to me.  The author has fallen into the trap of reading what she needs from her sources, whether they provide the evidence she wants or not.  I will admit I couldn't finish the first chapter and it may improve further along, but her rational for her conclusions escapes me.  The handwritten recipe books/journals/scrapbooks she studied could have provided a fascinating look at how women's lives and priorities have changed over the centuries, but her insistence on broad societal conclusions from these very personal documents left me cold.  When she directly discussed the documents and individuals she did a wonderful job, but when she tried to apply to the society at large their was a huge gap between her evidence and her conclusions 
 This book sat on my bookshelf for a couple of years, and I finally decided to get to it last week. I should have left it where it was. Although it gives you a decent overview of Chess and its artists, it reads like a dry listing of every recording session and every song that Chess ever did - most of which are of absolutely zero importance, and which nobody cares about. When it does mention a little tidbit that might be more interesting, it is usually given a sentence, maybe two if you're lucky. Furthermore, the author jumps all over the place for each topic; he goes back and forth between decades at the drop of a hat - and the company wasn't around that long. The writing is extremely sloppy, and uses odd punctuation and structure. I think that this may just be a British style of writing (the author is from London, according to the jacket). Whatever it is, it is really irritating for an American to read. If you've never read anything by a British writer, and you plan to read this book, prepare to be annoyed. The book would have been served better if it had been re-edited for publication in America. Also, I'll mention that the author puts WAY too much emphasis on how Chess did in Britain. I acknowledge that Britain played an important part in the revitalization of blues music in the 1960's, but really, does anybody care how The Dells sold in the UK? In general, by the writing and the content, it seems that the book was written by a British fan, one who likes the music, but doesn't have much of a clue of where it came from or why 
 If I wanted to listen to Interpol-I would. So what if they're British. I'm Texan. How does this fact make these schmucks better than American bands creating that "brit-rock" sound? That's right it doesn't. Now I'm not defending bands like The Bravery or The Killers (I am defending Interpol) but at least these guys jumped on the band wagen at least two years ago. Where were the "Editors" in 2002? Still struggling? Interpol had their debut out way before the "Editors". Just because this Tom Smith putz has an accent people are flocking to him. Fine. Slap an accent on Paul Banks and call it a day. The fact is "Antics", Interpol's weakest album (but still freakin' brilliant) surpasses anything from "The Back Room" 
 The recipes in this cookbook aren't simple, nor would I call this "home cooking." The ingredients required for some of these recipes are diverse and very, very gourmet-oriented. Truffle oil is often mentioned, for example. This is not to say that the recipes are bad, but if you're looking for easy, simple recipes, this is not the book to be buying 
 Bad pictures. Not enough about his death. Nat Hentoff continues to prove that he can't write. Boring. Greatly exaggerates Bix's influence on the world of jazz. Don't pay for this, pull an Abbie Hoffman 
 Tiresome, repetitive sexual descriptions, no character development, unexplained events, no plot, very little humor.  Ten years ago, Hamilton was doing interesting work, exploring some moral issues, having some character development, and humor.  Now both the Blake and Gentry series are predicable and sex obsessed 
 As true race fan, this was grossly disappointing.  The movie only shows about 10 minutes of racing, the rest of boring behind the scenes stuff.  I anticipated great sound as well, but that was stymied too.  Terrible background music and Andretti's narration overrides any chance of quality sound.  Save your $.. bucks, because this is not racing 
 Don't waste time if you're looking for an excellent intro text for a business ethics course.  This text has the following virtues: -reasonable overview of normative ethical theory in chapter 2 -short, pithy case studies to motivate problems  The text has the following vices: - it totally ignores libertarianism in the discussion of normative ethics (a significant oversight since it dominates the Western approach to property, contracts and other business issues) -there is a biased inclusion of primary sources.  For example, you'll find an essay in favor of unions but none opposing.  There is an essay criticizing employment at will but none defending it.  There is a defense of prferential treatment in hiring (e.g. affirmative action) but none criticizing it.  There is a quasi-defense of manipulative advertising but none criticizing it. -some of the primary sources are simply poor choices for a business ethics text.  They are either poorly argued or merely tangential to the real issues.  For example, "Buddhist Economics" by Schumacher, "Homosexuality, Prejudice, and Discrimination" by Mohr, "The Place of Non-humans in Environmental Issues" by Singer, etc.  Instead, I recommend the Beauchamp and Bowie anthology 
 IT'S A SNOOZER. SOME PARTS ARE JUST PLAIN DUMB AND THE PICTURE QUALITY JUST SUCKS. ITS NOT WORTH THE PRICE THEY ARE ASKING FOR.     
 I can't really say much of anything good about this book.  It was well written, but I didn't buy into the storyline or the actions of most of the characters.  I didn't really come away with anything after reading it either.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone 
 Simply put, this is one of the books that shattered Schlesinger's credibility as a legitimate historian once and for all.  Once he was "Artie," the precocious high-flying historian/prodigy, amazing his peers & elders with his dazzling talents as an author & scholar.  Now he is a superannuated peddler of Camelot nostalgia and a defender of a school of thought that has been so thoroughly discredited over the years that it truly is a wonder that anyone takes Schlesinger seriously anymore.  Really, the only author/historian that is worse in this field is possibly Manchester.  How can anyone regard this stuff as serious history?  It is as though Schlesinger has sustained a sort of man-crush on JFK for all these years and cannot bring himself to be even remotely objective about a rather undistinguished administration.   He really contributes nothing to this field of study, so save yourself the effort of reading this tripe 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 If you are looking for an unabashed cheerleader on the American Way, this book is for you. If you are already convinced that America is the pinnacle of Western Civilization, nothing in this book will change your mind. If you voted for George W Bush - you'll probably enjoy this book. On the other hand, if you believe America has made some mistakes and are looking for arguments to convince you that what you thought were mistakes were actually smart decisions - look elsewhere.   Revel is a lover of capitalism, liberalism, obviously an admirer of the USA and probably of George W Bush as well. He makes his disdain for many European positions, as well as those of the American left, quite clear. This is a book written for people who agree with American foreign policy. Revel is well informed on many American foreign policy positions as well as European arguments against those positions. On the rare occasions when he is not insulting Europeans who disagree with him, he provides intelligent and thoughtful views on foreign affairs.   The author spends most of the book distorting European views and insulting those who hold them. A fine example is his description of the US Missile Defense system. He claims that there are 2 arguments against it. One, that it doesn't work and the second that it will work too well and make useless the arsenals of the other nuclear powers. These are obviously contradictory arguments and he claims to be baffled that anyone could believe them both. Oddly enough, I've never heard from anyone who believed them both. I do recall the letter signed by 50 Nobel prize winning scientists claiming that the project is a waste of money. I also recall hearing from those worried about angering Russia and China.   Mr Revel's penchant for ridiculing those who disagree with him is occasionally amusing but never convincing. It's a shame. I think he's right on a number of points. If he would just turn his copious knowledge of foreign policy and his broad vocabulary toward convincing people instead of insulting them - he might actually have an impact on someone who doesn't agree with him already. 
 If you are trying to review for a standardized test such as the MCAT or DAT this book has poor organization and complicated explanations of general biological principles.  What I look for in a review book is outlines of important facts and figures to restore those little details that my brain has wandered away from.  This book goes into excruciating detail and lists far too many historical facts to be a good outline that refreshes and prepares you for standardized tests.  If you are trying to teach yourself this material, textbooks are much simpler and have better illustrations-well worth the added expense 
 I thought Tim A. Berra's "A Natural History of Australia" was a half baked research paper by a C student.  It made me doubt that the author was really an expert on the natural history of Australia or just compiling  a list of miscellaneous facts from numerous sources and presenting them in  organized text form.  There are several inexcusable holes in this list of  facts as well.  Understandably, anyone writing a book with a title like  this would be confounded by the huge subject of evolution in this isolated  continent.  But instead of attempting an expository essay on this he,  more-or-less, lists several key dates on evolution's time-line (many of  these are on a planetary scale not specific to Oz) and leaves it at that.   The two page chapter on geography explains next to nothing, historically  speaking. It tells you that Australia is the flattest, driest, most stable  continent etc etc, but never digs into the geologic past to say WHY.  By  avoiding the stories, and explanations behind WHY Australia became such a  unique place the book misses its own supposed HISTORICAL point.  That  frustrated me.  I would recommend this book only as a natural almanac full  of thousands of facts and photos, but never as a natural history 
 I tried to read this book(translated) to the portuguese, about 15 years ago.Even never finishing it, I as a brazilian (unemployed) agronomist must tell the reality about weberianism. At first, Max Weber was a man looking to show the reality.He wasn't a bigot(or mad) such as Loraine Boettner, Eric Jon Phelps, etc. With no doubt, Max Weber was a great scholar, a man with great IQ, a man man looking for reality.Even with this qualities, Max weber was wrong.Even a man like Max Weber, like you and me, is ever a prisioner of his times, informations and reality. The core idea of this book is that capitalism, industrial revolution and modern science were made by protestantism. Very believed idea in Weber's times. In fact, Weber puts "the cart ahead of the horse", in this idea.In fact, modern world wasn't created after Luther.It was shaped in XV Century, with the press and Great Navigations. The press was invented by a catholic german, called Johann Gutemberg.All the great navigators were catholic men.Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Bartolomeu Dias,Cabral, Gil Eanes,etc. 100% of then were catholics and were under catholic kings money and orders.With the Great discoveries the American continent was under Europe's hands.The claim that protestantism was the source of Europe's power was and is a fraud. In fact economically and lively, after Luther, protestant Germany became a nightmare until the end of 30 years War, in 1648.The claim that protestantism was good for Europe is a possibility, not a fact. In fact, we could see protestantism is a result of nacionalism, church's abuses, education and greed for church's money. Not all protestants countries of Europe had good economical results.Germany was doomed after Luther's Reformations.Not all catholic countries had bad economic results, as France shows.Spain and Portugal were bad, after jew's expeling, not after any reformation. With the Industrial Revolution, coal became condition "sine qua non" for economical sucess.And the Geology(not theology)decided the future for nations in Europe.With no coal Portugal, Spain, Italy were senteced to relatively poverty, in Europe.France with bad coal reserves, has some dificults in industrialization.Belgium, even more than 90% of his population in catholic church, had no economical problems, because Belgium had great coal's mines. Why England had so good economic results, ahead of every other european country?Beeing an island, England shouldn't have an expensive army against invasions.Then, England could built the biggest navy in the world.Geography, not theology gave economic sucess to England in XVI and XVII Century.With the Industrial Revolution, England had coal reserves looking to be minerated. Geography and later geology gave England industrial and economical sucess.With the 30 years War, Germany was splited in about 300 feufdoms. The England's decadency also came from no theological problemas, but geological, political and tecnological problems.With the reunification of Germany, an industrial enemy was created in continental Europe.With the invention of airplane, England could be attacked by an enemy with no navy.With the coming of oil's age, England (North Sea oil's reserves not found before the 1960's) had to import100% of his fuel.With both World wars, England's empire was sentenced to death. Protestantism in fact, like today, was ever divided in thounsands of cults, since his beginnings.If fact all kinds of protestantisms are image and similarity of his human creator, culture and society.Luther made a anti-semithic protestantism suc as himself.Calvin made a bank's friend protestantism, as himself was.And the England's king Henry VIII made an english protestantism.All reformator made a Jesus equal to himself.This fact is true until today.Protestantism don't make a society and culture.In fact a society and a culture makes a protestantism. The brazilian and latin american reality shows that protestantism itself don't make economical sucess.Here in Brazil, 80% of people who go to a church, go to a protestant (pentecostal) church.Do we have economical sucess with all this protestantism? NO!!!! This same fact happened in many parts of latin America.Bad economic results followed protestantism growing.El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua all are as protestants(pentecostals) as Brazil.All with bad economical results. About 35% of brazilian population are protestants, against about 80% of brazilian maids are protestants.In fact the brazilian protestants are, poorer than the general brazilian population.Also brazilian states with more protestants have bigger crime rates.In fact, more protestants, more crimes in Brazil.The poorest of all religious groups in Brazil are, the protestants(pentecostal).Only protestantism as a medicine for economical, political and cultural troubles is a quackery. Not a single african or latin american country had good economical results after protestantism's growing.At the same time, Spain with less than 1% of his population protestant, is an economical sucess.Italy and Portugal with only about 2% of protestants are also developed countries.  This book is a source with some good things to read.As I wrote up, Max Weber was an honest scholar, not a mad or a bigot.After all, Max Weber was looking to show us the reality, but he only wrote us rooted, in his own times, believes and realities.Every man is a prisioner of his times, friends and realities.And Max Weber wasn't an exception.          
 I watched the whole movie, but it took me several sittings. Bad script, acting, and stunts all around. You can see the stunt wires in several scenes and they made little effort to disguise Arnie's stunt doubles. Some of the shots are just terrible. The guy with the chain link shirt looks like a character out of the village people. The masterminds accent changes with every scene, spanish, french, I'm not sure he knew what he was trying to do. Then, hey we all know Arnies huge, but they have shots and shots of just him and his muscles. Arnold does act or dress like a "commando" until the end of the movie. That was weird. All around a bad movie ...  but I did watch it all 
 The autobiography of Chief Plenty-Coups is a fascinating account, not just of Plains Indian life, but of the rise of a leader who was brave, honest, and fair in all aspects of his life.  Here was a man who learned to compromise and build a consensus when acting for his people.  This should be required readng for all children, and for any adult who has aspirations as a leader of children, of a community, or a nation.  If physical prowess and aggressive territoriality are really to be the hallmarks of our society's heroes, then let us have a role model that adds to those qualities expert diplomacy and a deep caring for the nation's children. That this book is in his own words makes it more powerful and persuasive.  While this edition does not have the illustrations of the 1935 school text edition, it does have photographs, a map, and background information about Plenty-Coups' life and importance in our nation's history 
 I studied the early writings of Mr. Hillman, as a student in Vermont. He was once a real genius, original and gutsy if more incomprehensible. Then, some editor got him to "make sense" And in the Soul's Code, I  suppose he did, in a pablum-ish way. But this book? I couldn't make nor  head nor tails of its structure or meaning. Where o where did the gods put  this man's genius? Or rather, what price was he willing to take to his  great writing to render this mess? Well, because he is a great author in  the past, i cannot give him one star. But for anyone else, i'd give this  none 
 Unintentionally hilarious, Giles has now joined the pathetic ranks of those attempting to make conservative christian fundamentalism "hip". His grand strategy? To make forced, unfunny pop-culture references in tandem his gestapo-like "call to arms" against the evil forces of the liberal and the secular, who are intent on turning the USA into another decadent Rome and destroying Christianity, of course. He turns out to be as hip and inviting to the youth of today as the "rapping grandma" in the latest teen comedy, yet this grandma turns out to be a rabid Phyllis Schlafly. Avoid like the plague 
 This book is offensive to at least one of the two genders, though it's hard to say which. It suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot, more or less. Whether that's more insulting to the male brain or the female body, I'm not sure, but the book portrays neither gender realistically.  I like Heinlein, and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential, but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass, and it's not even particularly good at being that.  The gender-swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so, but Heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo-enlightened erotica instead of literature. More's the pity 
 Lies, lies, lies. I know of a case where a woman who is a total and utter verbal abuser, wealthy, has convinced her support group that SHE is the victim. She is a total victimizer. Her children are straight A students, no drugs, clean rooms, no trouble with authorities. But the trouble is her abusiveness...anyhow...the groups claim to not support physical and verbal abusiveness on the part of parents, but none of that has changed with this woman....Never does this book talk about child abuse. Never does it address that end of the coin. It never deals with educational neglect, other sorts of neglect on the part of parents. John Holt, a ten times better writer, parent, educator, PERSON that the folks that got this book ghost written (couldnt even write it themselves), said "THERE ARE NO PROBLEM CHILDREN WITHOUT PROBLEM PARENTS.&quot 
 I am a Trevanian maniac. I buy every used copy of Shibumi I can find, just in case the world ends and I am left to wander the rubble with no chance of a new edition of Shibumi. get it? I love Trevanian. This new book? More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every  genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile. But I found this new book to be boring, trite, petty, and poorly written, and it gets one star because, as a Trevanian diehard, I have no choice 
 Uh oh.  The remnants of the Empire are gathering together to form a threat to the New Republic.  Uh oh.  There is a giant superweapon being constructed using the original plans and scientists who worked on the Death Star.  Sigh.  Out of all the possible stories that able to be told in the Star Wars Universe (see the Medstar Duology and the  Republic Commando novels for examples), this is the story that Darksaber tells.  For Star Wars, one must say "how prosaic".  It's all been done before.  Two movies and danced around in the novels.  This is the best that Kevin Anderson and Lucasfilm could come up with for the novel?    Oh, well.  Here's the deal: The Hutts are gathering components to build said superweapon, the title weapon.  Remnants of the Empire, Admiral Daala and Pallaeon (second in command to Grand Admiral Thrawn) are pulling together various warlords to strike at the heart of the New Republic and hurt the New Republic bad.  Luke Skywalker is seeking to find a way to restore the Jedi Powers of his love Callista.  Leia, Han, and Chewbacca are investigating the Hutts to find out what the Hutts are planning.  This all comes together with a major threat to the New Republic.    If it wasn't for the fact that this book is much of the same old same old for Star Wars fiction Darksaber wouldn't be that bad. Kevin Anderson has crafted a fast paced classic feeling Star Wars novel.  The word "classic" is used here in the sense that the style is reminiscent of the original Star Wars trilogy.  So, the action is fun and there are quips and back talk and little guys vs the Big Bad, but the novel just felt like a retread.  It is a tired story.  Anderson's writing isn't strong enough to overcome a story that does not add anything significant to the Star Wars Universe.  It's middle of the road Star Wars.  Nothing special to see here.  Not truly worth the effort.  -Joe Sherr 
 While I realize it's hard not to be biased about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, I think we all expect the Complete Idiot's Guide series to be more factual & even-handed, rather than grossly opinionated. Mr Bard gives no voice to the Palestinian or humanist sides of things.   If you want to learn more about this subject - along with all of the Middle East, I'd recommend The Middle East for Dummies. This writer gives both sides of the story and reminds me of the diversity and plain sense of "just wanting to get by" that everyone in the world shares.  Also, note that many of the reviewers for this book (as well as the Dummies book) are very biased themselves - just check out their other reviews. It's pretty shocking. Example: Jill Malter - she lists herself as a "zionist" on her profile. How do you think that reflects her opinions here 
 The films in this set I rate a 3 out of 5 as they are classic giallos. However the set is so messed up with bad encoding that you cannot get past scene 6 without pixelation or worse the disc just stops and the player says "Disc unreadable". I have exchanged it a few times to no avail of a fix. Amazon has stopped selling it as of this moment so buyer beware! Noshame doesn't test the discs when they print them and the problem is a lot more widespread than originally thought. I only hope they can remedy this issue before people become leery of purchasing anymore films put out by Noshame. Amazon the great company they are were willing to exchange this a million times over, Noshame on the other hand doesn't even reply to emails or any other contact. Noshame is a GREAT name for this company! Stick with companies like "Anchor Bay" and "Blue Underground" who know how to put out better quality products 
 I picked up the book hoping to learn stuff about NAT that I didn't already know.  Unfortunately, I found that I was reading a lot about basic concepts that anyone who is going to use NAT should already know.  Sections about the IP protocol and TCP headers!  At one point, the author says ARP is part of the invisible data link operations.  Who is going to use NAT and not know about ARP???  Most of the book is about 5 main points about NAT rehashed over and over again.  NAT is pretty simple; if Kernighan & Ritchie could get away with a book a quarter of the size of the NAT book, Dutcher (the auther of NAT Handbook) must have gotten paid by the page 
 Hansen doesn't quite get it. He looks at the Indian political scence using Eurocentric categories, without caring to analyze the control the bureaucracy holds on the strings of power and the alienation of wide classes of people. His arguments explaining the rise of the Hindu parties are not convincing. He has not examined the effect that Pakistani policies and the contiuing Islamic terrorism have had on Hindu morale

 I hated this book because it's hard to read.  I don't like wading through sentences as long as paragraphs full of obscure words that require a dictionary nearby.    I just wanted to get a general understanding of money and the Federal Reserve from a source I trust and admire - Milton Friedman.  I don't mind facts and figures but I resent writing that forces me into hard labor to decipher the meaning.  I think good writing is communicating in the simplest way possible, not in trying to impress the reader with the author's vocabulary and ability to construct impenetrable, wannabe-sophisticated, long, compound sentences.  Don't get me wrong, I'm an engineer and I've got a decent vocabulary and fairly decent language skills.    I've found the books by Murray N. Rothbard to be much easier to read than this book though not as easy to read as I would like.  I'm still looking for the perfect monetary history/economics book.  I hope there's one out there somewhere 
 One WEAK night!...zero stars if that was available. I never realized Bon Jovi was this bad a live band. They obviously get a LOT of production help in the studio because this album (several different concerts in several different venues) is ALL bad.  Sorry for them and sorry for me for buying it 
 I have been a fan of Connie Willis for quite some time and I highly recommend her earlier time travel novels, 'The Doomsday Book', and 'To Say Nothing Of The Dog' and her very humorous short novel about fads and trends entitled 'Bellweather'.  Her more recent book, 'Passage' concerns near-death experiences.  It has the same humorous tone as the earlier novels but I found the novel disturbing and felt unsettled after reading it.  I suggest that  'Bellweather' be read prior to reading 'Passage'.  Otherwise, the reader might be so put off as to avoid the author's other fine novels and short stories 
 I don't give a hoot about movies and whatnot.  I havn't seen this one and probably never will.  But I bought this album thinking it would be interesting to see how Ry Cooder (I am a fan of his) would approach Robert Johnson.  Well, the answer is, he doesn't.  Ry Cooder does Ry Cooder: that deliberately floppy, sloppy sound I guess he and Little Feat patented.  One of the reviewers here seriously recommends this CD as an intro to the Blues!  LOL.    So, I say buyer beware.  NEVER buy an album without listening to it.  No matter who it is.  Ry has turned me off a bit.  Kinda expected to hear old time acoustic blues.  Like, say, Robert Johnson.  Silly me 
 When I was considering buying this film, I read all the reviews and though alot of them were negative, I decided to get it anyway because I am a huge fan of Jane Austen's books and like BBC's movies. I was very disapointed after watching it! This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I could not believe it! The music was much to modern for time period, and they made the movie much too creepy, whereas the book is much more lighthearted, though there are some dark parts to it. If you're considering buying this, I would advise against it. I hate to be negative, but watching this movie was a waste of time. 
 Sure, these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but I give their functionality an F. As soon as I opened one of these cases to put a CD in it, the case broke. It happened to 3 cases out of the 12 I have used already. I wasn't using excessive force, in fact most people call me gentle. Buy at your own risk and HANDLE WITH CARE! 
 This book was really a waste of time. When I was done reading, I was no better off than when I started. The beginning is really interesting in that it describes what kind of feelings go on inside the mind of a shy person. I thought I was the only one in the world who felt these things, and it was interesting to see them expressed by someone else in a book. So I continued to read on to the parts where they tell you how to get better. It said to try stuff like writing in a journal every day and to "think positive", "be assertive", and "practice making small talk". Like I didn't consider that on my own! This book really did not need to be written. What they could have done was just take the beginning of the book and sell it on its own as a short story or something, since it is the only useful or interesting part. After the first part of the book, it's basically telling you to go see a psychiatrist or get medication or both. It starts to get repetitive and is basically filled with the same useless suggestions that any person could have thought of, but they keep re-wording them throughout the book. So save yourself some money and don't buy this book. If you're interested in reading the opening part of the book, see if you can find it in a library 
 It's a good read but one might not get much out of the whole book.  With a little research on the internet, this book renders useless; besides, the advices are very dated.  Try E R Lilley's book better 
 The Big Rock Candy Mountain is a novel writen by Wallace Stegner.  I have heard many great things about Stegner's work, so i picked this up with  much anticipation.  Perhaps his other books are  much better, but this book is not good.  And when  I say that I'm being very gracious.  The story centers around a family of four, Bo,  his wife, Elsa, and their two sons Chester and Bruce. The novel follows them from place to place throughout America, about their poverty, and overall faliure.  The fundamental problem with the book is this:  You're supposed to feel bad for the family and their bad luck. But you don't because the author would rather give you  pointless detail (while ignoring important detail) than help you get to know and like the characters.  By the time that their lives are ruined you don't even like any of the  characters.  If the author had spent more time developing a mental relationship between you and this family than the book could pull the right strings.  Then there is also the question of possibility.  Is it really possible for a person (Bo the husband) to be naturally good at absolutly everything? And pushing it even further is it possible for this person to not be able to make any money what so ever.  In this book It describest this husband as being a great baseball player (yes he's hurt, but why not become a coach or something?), a nearly flawless hunter, and many other things.  Yet he remains broke for thirty years?  Also the seemingly dramatic parts of this book are more funny than dramatic.  Wallace Stegner may have written many other good books. Through his writing i can see some potential.  But in this book his potential even as a good writer only shows when he's "in a groove".  When he's in a groove he seems to have a tallent for writing, but when he's not, his sentences are long and jumbled and often don't even make sense.  If you don't believe me then here is the first sentence of the book just to prove it to you:  "The train was rocking through wide open country before Elsa was able to put off the misery of leaving and reach out for the freedom and release that were hers now."  See what i mean?  I'm sure that a writer such as Dickens or Hemingway never put down a sentence that confusing.  For that sliver of potential i award this book it's one and a half stars, but keep in mind, this may be the worst book i've ever read 
 I have never heard so much awful sound come out of something so small. These were simply the worst speakers ever. They are scratchy and tinny and you have to turn the volume all the way up and that makes them hiss and buzz. I hope they were defective-- thats what I said when I returned them-- because I can't believe any company would sell something that was this terrible. Oh and the silver-- it is just a bit of paint on the front. The speakers are actually white. 
 I read this book after reading "The Wal-Mart Effect" (by Charles Fishman), and I immediately noticed that I didn't like the writing style in The Google Story (and trust me there was an extreme contrast between these books).  I think the title sums my aggravations up nicely: "The Google Story: Inside the Hottest Business, Media, and Technology Success of Our Time".  It seems to me that Vise is always trying to inflate the facts and turn them into some sort of sensational story (when he even bothers to use facts instead of a bunch of editorial).  Another thing that bugs me about this book is how Vise tries to inflate the "battle" between Microsoft and Google and make it sound like they are arch-rivals.  Google and Microsoft are operating in different spaces in the technology world currently.  Microsoft's bread and butter is Operating Systems, professional office software, IDEs, etc.  Google's bread and butter is advertising.  Sure, there might be a battle for the best corporate culture, but it's not like Microsoft releases Windows Vista and the Google team scrambles to release Google Earth 4.0 to show them up.  Vise also cites a speech given by Eric Schmidt at a school in Washington to illustrate this "battle" between companies.  I personally found Eric Schmidt's speech to be banal and irritating, and a mark against Google rather than for.  He sure did "attack Microsoft on their home ground", but how cool is that?  Schmidt pretty much acted like a jerk and tried to snatch up the best and brightest from a school in Microsoft's back yard so he could "flip the bird" to Steve Ballmer (who by the way is also a big jerk, so no big deal there).  But Vise makes it sound like it was some covert mission into enemy territory to make the world a better place.  As others have noted, there's no real wealth of "insider" knowledge on Google here.  I was hoping for a more technical book (e.g. I wanted more info on their clustering technology and less info on their investors).  He mentions that there was a fire that wiped out one of their data centers and their search engine coped with no problems.  How?  Doesn't it seem as if there would be a problem if a data center was taken out?  What about the search requests that were being processed by that data center at that time?  Still, I gave this book 2 stars.  Larry and Sergey were the saving grace, because their charisma and story somehow manages to shine (however dim or brief) through the pages of this book.  Because of that, I was able to get some value from this book.  But, I was able to derive value in spite of the author rather than because of the author 
 This title is useless for a reader with general knowledge in electronics.  I'm an electrical engineering student and when I had to design with a microcontroller I bought this book. Instead of introducing you to "real world design", you are introduced only in a series of possible problems that you might find in developing system. You are absolutely not introduced in the design. It's a general book for all microcontroller but is usefull for no one.  In some part of the text it is also very confusing.  Bad text!! 
 This is a book on a fascinating topic, but the book does not really bring the topic to life. The illustrations are quite limited, and certainly are not the strong point of the book: the book relies on its text. The text does cover a lot of ground, touching on many topics, but explains nothing in any depth.   Skimming through the book I notice things which hit me unpleasantly, although it would be an overstatement to say I am noticing serious errors. Maybe somebody will like this style of writing? I am unsure 
 Not nearly up to the level we'd expect from Mr. Rogers. The pictures are dated and unattractive and the text is boring and uninformative. Don't be fooled by the September 1997 date--this book is a reprint of a slim volume  originally published years ago, and seems  old-fashioned to today's  children. It looks like a cheap imitation of Alison Mack's delightful and  effective TOILET LEARNING: THE PICTURE BOOK TECHNIQUE FOR CHILDREN AND  PARENTS, using tacky photos instead of Mack's cute drawings, and leaving  out the all-important section that gives guidance to parents. Mr. Rogers'  book is just the thing for parents who want to save a few dollars at their  children's expense 
 While this book may be good for teachers or people who want to review previously mastered skills and techniques, it is not good for the independent learner who has no knowledge of the double bass. I purchased this book after taking up the string bass as a second instrument. I am learning on my own, since I already have a private instructor for my main instrument, piano. I was disappointed in this book, because there were not enough pictures indicating basic positions. The one page of visual clues contained in the book were poor, and the few photographs were barely discernable because of their poor resolution. If you want to learn the double bass, look for a bassist or find a better book 
 The language in this "novel" is so pretentious and convoluted as to be largely unreadable by the average reader. It seems that James never met a comma he didn't like, and uses them to imbed all sorts or modifiers and asides. Although the graduate students may attach some deeper meaning to this, I suspect he really didn't have a clear idea of anything he wanted to say so he simply rambled on. At least with Faulkner there is a payoff. With James, all the language covolutions lead to nothing in the way of action. Random House must have had a large,unsold inventory of this book ( not surprising) so they included it in their top 100 list. James has single-handedly ruined my project of reading the all of the top 100. I will not, cannot, albeit I would like to, read,with any pleasure, the other two James books, novels perhaps, on the list, the Random House list that is 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 This novel has some campy appeal since it introduces us to the famous Sam Spade, the morally ambiguous, hard drinking, but devastatingly attractive private eye.  The rest of the characters in this short novel don't amount to much, and as a result I didn't find the plot of much interest either.  I have to believe that this novel was voted onto the Radcliffe List at least partly on the strength of the movie that was based on it 
 I wouldn't normally write a review of such drivel but felt that I had to when I saw what Christiane Schmidt had to say. Now we all know Mr Gibson has got issues with the British (as well as others) - just look at that other pile of tosh - Braveheart. But here is an example of why rewriting history to fit your own personal prejudice is dangerous. The usual response is "It's not history but Hollywood, it's fiction based on historical events". But the problem is that some people actually believe it really happened like that! Now I'm sure that many atrocities took place on either side of what was in effect a civil war, but I've never read of the British burning down churches with people inside - Nazis, yes....British, no. But who cares about whether it really happened....it's only a film!! Good grief, next thing you know they'll be making a film about the US recovering the first enigma machine.....oops. 
 One can't be sure that this book isn't deliberately exploiting a cynical belief that most business books are so bad, that if this weren't crappy, it wouldn't sell. Even for someone who believes in Csik's theory of flow, this book is a no-win blow-out. Instead of making clear statements backed by evidence, the book's tone and presentation are mere editorializing assertions. There is no reason to read this, when his original popularization, Flow, more carefully and clearly summarizes Csikszentmihalyi's interesting research. 
 Catherine Crier and indeed every defense attorney and state district attorney in the country had no doubts that Peterson did it.  Given both the evidence and his odd behavoir trying to flee the country and being caught in the process.  But this book is little more then a retold story of something that was already fully documented by those who took the case to court and won.  Thanks, but no Thanks Ms. Crier 
 I bought this as I am a Seattle resident (also 20s/30s female like the main character).  I thought it would be cool to find a book that combined the story of a woman's growth and a setting in Seattle.    Unfortunately, it's not a strong story.  The main character is shallow and self-absorbed, and the other characters aren't compelling- and this doesn't change over the course of the story.  The story revolves around the character's relationships to men and a couple of female characters (mainly her mother and her best friend)- not compelling alternative Seattle characters.  I really don't feel that this is a compelling story of human growth or broadening horizons 
 It was mostly the re-telling of the biker news that you probably already know.  
 I did not buy this book, I leafed through it at the bookstore. It is in all black and white; no color! A book whose topic is the physics of light and color should contain color illustrations

 I was excited to see that Steven King had a new novel out.  I began the book full of anticipation, eager to enter into King's world.  However, as I began to read I became more and more unable to sustain interest in Lisey's world.  I was bored, and I gave up.  Perhaps I will try again some time;  the book is still weighing down the shelf 
 This is one of the most helpful books for teaching that I have found. Spurgeon is known as "Prince of Preachers" and he really is a great teacher. I an certanly thankful He left some of his work for us to use. His ancedotes are great 
 Unless you have a perfectly flat yard with golf-course grade grass and absolutely no twigs, leaves, pinecones, moisture, or variations in ground level, this thing won't go.  On flat concrete it seems to do OK.  In the yard, however, we are forever PUSHING this thing around because it cannot go on it's own.  The wheels are constantly spinning out.  We bought it as a 3rd birthday gift for my son.  Obviously, he would like to ride it, but we hardly ever use it because my husband and I hate walking behind him and pushing!  We thought we had purchased a great thing after all the reviews.  We were wanting him to have fun and help us with yard work by hauling sticks/leaves/pinecones around.  How wrong we were.  It was fairly easy step-by-step assembly.  We have had no breakage or charging problems, but we don't use it very often because of the major traction problem.  It does seem to stay charged quite awhile even after long amounts of time in storage.  We bought this after a lot of research.  These people who think this thing is so great must have flat concrete yards.  I have never spent so much money and been so disappointed.   
 She should come with a champagne bottle, mirror and teeny-tiny bag of coke 
 I hated this film. I saw the original French film which this is based on and absolutely loved it. This remake is terrible and I gape at Jean Reno agreeing to go through with it. I don't speak French and it's not necessary with the subtitles that come with the original. Don't get this film get the real thing 
 Book is totally disorganized.  Beautiful pictures, but no way of researching values.  The price list is in the back organized by lot no & auction no.  NO reference to the illustration of the marbles in the front of the book, no way to look it up.  Starts out promising, then becomes a total jumble.  Totally impossible to locate anything.  Too time consuming, and then still no resolve 
 Pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers, whose very existence and relevance is due to that king. What you will get from that kind of writing? Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration. Sound familiar? Noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings. Probably she does not care. Americans are lucky that they never had any king. Noonan fails to provide any inside information how Reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - AIDS, Iran-Contra, welfare, deficits, funding mujahideens, cozy relationship with Saddam. Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler, happy citizens..."happily lived ever after". Basically, this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer.  Her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers don't know already. This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80's (which is nothing new in human civilizations). Secondly, she fails to understand that Reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working Americans. But she gives ALL the credits to Reagan, except all the negative things, like Iran-Contra. In the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings, characters of kings and the writings about them 
 I bought this because so many readers love it.  I just don't think it was funny.  It's just not my taste.  It was odd.  I guess because this writer has a huge following of fans.  
 I adore Bach.  I was intrigued by the enigma of Glenn Gould.  Having heard the Goldberg Variations by a number of lesser talents both on piano and harpsichord i thought it was time for me to finally shell out on what I've been frequently assured is the definitive reading of the variations.  I find I've spent £14 on some decent Bach with some tramp muttering and whining in the background!!  It's not easy to ignore - in fact its impossible to ignore - and totally destroys the pleasure of listening to the music.  I would no accept any musician destroying a piece of music by singing - in an entirely different key - along as being acceptable, regardlss of his reputation.  What we have here is Shine syndrome.  David Helfgott could not play.  He was very strange so we sat with indulgent smiles, patronising this poor lost soul, whilst he strangled numerous pieces.  Similarly we find a poor Bach recording with a deranged individual ruining the recording by constant muttering and humming lauded as a classic.  I look forward to ecsatic reviews for other pieces destroyed by extraneous noise.  A La Boheme with jet engine.  Some Messien with added car alarm noises.  Mozart with a crank caller dubbed on.  If you gave this five stars you're rewarding a reputation and haven't listened to the music at all 
 Dont take me wrong I do love Mariah but this movie is not making any sense to me I mean Mariah doesnt seem very interest to "play" in this movie!!! This movie is all about music music music music music repeating over and over again nothing new nothing has been changed... come on!!! but then Mariah seem to be better in another movie called Wisegirls but again I honestly dont think that Mariah should be an actress herself I mean I think she is better off to be a singer instead of playing movies. Wisegirls she seem like she wanted to have the "attention" and "show-off" like saying in her mind: "Look at me I am in the movie!" I honestly deep in my heart she dont need to be playing in any movies unless she stands up and do her "work" with her actions in the movies not like this and Wisegirls movies. I feel bad for giving this movie a 1 star but I had to say what's my opinion about this movie anyways. Wisegirls was alittle better than this one! 
 While this is an excellent and well written story, the Blackstone Audio version is horribly read. It is painful to listen to. The reader is very "nasal" and the attempts at accents and characterizations are just simply horrific. Find another version, or read the book if you can. I can't, and had to endure this version of the audiobook. I listen to a LOT of audiobooks and this experience was a nightmare 
 This one needs work. We tried, annd tried to make this microphone work, and it did-- for about a minute at a time. When it falls out you have to keep starting over again. We returned it. Too bad, it's a fantastic idea if it could only stay connected. Our leadpad works fine with the other books, it's just that the microphone on top of the cartridge makes this invention top heavy so that it won't stay in 
 I think this is exactly the kind of textbook that should be distributed in abundance throughout all states wanting ID as part of their science curriculum. This will not only guarantee my two daughters a great deal less competition in medical school, it will also help fill the need for astute, critical thinkers in the food service industry.  An EXCELLENT BOOK! David/San Francisc 
 I purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model Fujifilm camera, reviews here, price and functions. At the same time, I also purchased the larger xD card. Almost out of the box, this camera has given me nothing but grief. What others had said about the blurry photos I can certainly echo. A month or so after purchase, the lens would not open, or it would not open totally. I first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause....after changing the batteries, the problems still existed - SOME OF THE TIME. Not always - just sporadically. Just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities.   In addition to that, now that I'm looking at other brands of cameras I find the xD card I purchased is not transferable so I'm out the cost of that as well. Another malfunction of this camera is after "erasing" all photos on the xD card, taking more photos and uploading the new photos, I found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones? I don't know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera.   I would NOT recommend this camera to anyone....it's a total dud. I'm very disappointed with Fujifilm and am now looking at Nikon and Cannons. Good luck Fujifulm...you need it 
 This is NOT a 13 cup capacity, it's about 2 cups!  Do not be fooled 
 Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.    The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.         
 I own this product but on choosing a waffle maker for my daughter, I did not consider purchasing another one.  I have had it a year, using it about once a month.  It sticks and the light doesn't always work. It does make waffles but I will be purchasing a different one in the near furture. 
 With each passing book, the story lines seem to get thinner and thinner, which is why, I suppose, Karon decided to uproot the preacher and his wife and move them to an island 600 miles away from Mitford. A change of scenery to introduce some new people and stories. Still, it seems the main character spends most of his time either praying or saying "consider it done." The characters seem to lack depth and almost everyone is perfect. And the people who aren't perfect still get to have happy endings. The things that make for a good story - a character who wants something and is trying to get it against all odds, a plot that has a climax, a believable antagonist and protagonist, etc. - are lacking in this book 
 Author doesn't have anything in this book which not already available free of cost on the internet.  It was a total waste of my time and money procuring and reading this book.  May be useful to people who can't search items on their own online. Admire the market who knew how to title useless books like these! 
 This was my first Wilbur Smith book.  I thought it was all right for an adventure genre.  There is enough historical research to add color.  And it certainly moves along well.  Many of the events are not believable, but you can say the same for James Bond.  The book jumps between history and legend easily and superficially.  Boys grow into manhood overnight.  Women fall deeply in love by seeing someone from afar.  Crocodiles are much more aggressive than in real life.  But it is easy reading for passing a few hours 
 Cool Concept and everything but when I tried to install the driver my CD-Rom drive wouldnt even pick up that little CD 
 I love looking through baby name books, and, truth be told, I was running out of names for my Sims, so I picked this one up.  Although lengthy, the book gives you lists of names.  Never once did I see a definition or a reason why a certain name is popular.  I like unique names, but there are no prenunciation keys or anything helpful.    Just lists.  Famous names, names famous people used for their kids, unique middle names, and, of course, the most popular names.  There's a lot of overlapping--the list of most popular names in Canada and the US and the UK are devastatingly similar.  Even more disappointing is the part where they start listing popular names in other countries, and I flip the page to find the list of 100 in the US quickly dwindles through France and Ireland to not even five in Middle Eastern countries.  Just when this book starts getting interesting, they ruin it by forgetting the follow-through.  I would like to have seen a history on each name, reasons why they are popular, and a pronunciation key to help sound out difficult, unique names.  I finally ended up flipping through the index, picking out names for my Sims, then sending it back 
 After listening to Glenn's 'Soul Mover', I guess this is what i should have expected. just an absolute bore! Ok now that thats out of the way, let me rant- when the hell is some veteran musicans gonna put out something that just fking jams. Because it sure as fk aint Metalica. It aint mp3s's or pirating thats keeping good bands away, there just aint any pulling all the stops, and i'm too fking old the take this roll, so if you come come across a great band ,suport the hell out of them 
 Subtitled guy's mom is sick. The guy is also depressed. Meets a ex-hustler on beach. They kiss, fight, make-up, over and over.(most of the movie) They break up. Boy meets hustler's ex and they play with dog on beach. The End 
 Dang, Carl, how could you?  Let me start by saying that CH is one of my favorite writers.  His stories aren't necessarily epic in nature but his dialog & characterizations & writing in general are virtually beyond reproach.  Even though his storylines border on slice-of-life rather than edge-of-your-seat thrillers, Hiaasen's writing is typically so good, his books are still extremely entertaining page-turners.  That said, Native Tongue was quite a letdown for me.  Usually I'll finish a book like this in one or two days.  I struggled for almost two weeks to finish it, putting it down at the drop of a hat.  In his defense, this was one of Hiaasen's earlier efforts.  Everything since Native Tongue has been infinitely better.  If you're new to Hiaasen, don't let this book turn you off.  His other works are definitely worth reading 
 OK, so the title track is a great song, cannons and all, and Inject the Venom and Put the Finger on You are both decent rockers. The rest, however, is the sign of a once-good band now simply sticking to the formula that brought them success. Consider the following: Virtually every song on For Those about to Rock We Salute You is a midtempo heavy rocker about sex. Virtually every song on Back in Black was a midtempo heavy rocker about sex. Same with Highway to Hell, and Powerage, and Let There Be Rock, and... well, pretty much every AC/DC album. But while those albums were great, this one sucks. Just look at some of the cliched song titles: Let's Get It Up, Evil Walks, Spellbound.. 
 This book isn't worth the paper its written on.  Nothing but advertisements, get rich schemes. If your interested in a good drop shipper contact me and  I'll put in touch with a good drop shipper 
 I bought this scale to replace my previous scale with body fat option.  It was not easy to use, as you HAVE TO put in your information unless you want to use kilograms, and you still have to enter your height in meters.  All that aside, it continues to tell me that my body fat is between 14 and 15%.  Am I an athlete?  No.  Am I female? Yes.  Is 14% body fat possible???  Well let's just say it is HIGHLY unlikely.  I can't comment on the water numbers it gives me because I don't really have anything to go on there, but even at my fittest I was over 20% body fat, and that was a while ago.. 
 I bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier. He didn't even notice it was there. I put it near his crate and it still didn't stop him from barking.  I pushed the manual button and still nothing.  It promises to stop annoying barking, but it didn't stop my dog for one minute.  It was a complete waste of my money 
 General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, in his farewell address to Congress on April 19, 1951, said, "But once war is forced upon us, there is no other alternative than to apply every available means to bring it to a swift end. War's very object is victory, not prolonged indecision. In war there is no substitute for victory."  The purpose of war is to destroy an enemy's ability to fight, and his will to fight. Germany started WWII. Germany's will and ability to fight was destroyed. Germany lost. Herr Jorg Friedrich can't change or rewrite history, and his hand wringing attempt is typical of liberals who never accept responsibility for their actions.  Incendiary bombs, cluster bomblets with a steel nose and magnesium body, are effective, as both the Germans and Japanese discovered. The next step up is nuclear. If Germany had them, they would have been used on London and other cities.  Germany started a war within a war with Brittan by intentionally booby-trapping some of its bombs with an anti-fuze removal device intended to kill the British bomb disposal men. German V-1 and V-2 missiles killed hundreds, perhaps thousands of innocent English civilians. The Allies have no reason to fill guilty about the use of incendiary bombs.  Herr Friedrich questions the moral basis of Allied action. I wonder if he would be questioning the moral basis of Nazi Germany if Hitler had won? Perhaps he should concentrate on the plight of the German Jews and Allied POWs. Now, that is something to whine about 
 I could attack this book for its lack of political merit, but that would just come off as a rant. What rather incites this negative review is that the book is just so poorly written. The text is laced with opinion statements masked as fact (for example, the semantic debate over what constitutes a "conservative;" this argument, which is one of the cover issues of the book, is bizarre on its own because it takes the late-18th century definition of liberal and stacks it up against the 20th century definition of conservative, but again, neither here nor there).  Every sentence is very simple, there are no words that are too big, so as not to confuse every South Park conservative who gets lost between the Dan Browns, the Steve Kings, and the 2-for-$11 DVD sections at the bookstores. The book is brimming with needless erreta and digressions, distractions, not to mention a fair number of grammatical errors, ironic (or appropo?) given the book's harsh condemnation of the American intellectual; in a book where every professor is a communist and every college graduate is a tree-hugger, it's not terribly surprising to find so much passive voice, subject-object confusion, confused pronouns, and uncited "data."  Certainly a fine bookshelf filler for every budding, young neoconservative. But if you're interested in buying a book that you'll be able to get all the way through without chuckling to yourself and muttering, "and this is presented as a HISTORY book?" you may wish to look elsewhere 
 I wish I'd read the Amazon review before buying this book.  Some of the information is useful and I do agree with the bits about the uselessness of store bought junky plastic toys and stupid childrens' music but the following really stood out:  1) the authors just HAD to take the opportunity to drive the message home that bottle feeding babies and pain relief during childbirth is a bad bad thing.  If there is one thing I detest, it is people that think it's their right to tell women how to feed their babies, or not to use pain relief.  I'd like to see if the authors visit their dentist and not get some pain relief.  Absolutely backwards and outright offensive.  2) you can begin to toilet train at 12-15 months.  What a joke!  What the authors describe is oten referred to as "toilet timing".    It is widely advised by numerous child health experts that a child is not reading to be toilet trained until much later as they lack the mental ability to understand the whole toilet thing when they're that young.  And I had to laugh at the statistic of how many children were toilet trained at that young age many years ago, what a joke!  3) the breastfeeding bits are a joke, I'm sure breastfeeding consultants the world over would be horrified at the "advice" here.  4) the low bed.  I understand the theory behind it but get real!  They say that children in cots have fallen and sustained spinal and head injuries.  Gee, and that doesn't happen with kids that fall against a wall or low wooden toyshelf or wooden toys?  What they suggest is extremely unsafe-- using bolsters or cushions around the bed: SIDS RISK #1.  Not tucking a blanket in: SIDS RISK #2.  Actually that second one is so bad it deserves more than one check point.  If you've been living under a rock recently you probably don't know that a loose blanket exponentially increases the risk of suffocation.  5) parts of the authors' philopsophies seem to completely contradict Montessori philosophy.  I will be very interested to know how Montessori teachers feel about this book.  6) Parents are baaaad if they choose to use disposable nappies.  I started off with cloth for my son who unfortunately was a really big wee-er.  I was constantly changing nappies, constantly pailing nappies, constantly washing nappies, constantly flushing poo off liners, constantly hanging out nappies, constantly folding nappies.  Coupled with sleep deprivation and not getting any other work done, as well as my enjoyment of motherhood being reduced, I switched to disposables when I found out I could use a recycling service.  Result?  HOURS more free to spend with my son.  So much for the authors' rubbish about valuable interaction time with your baby being reduced because you're not changing a disposable as much.  I haven't read the bit about no fences around the school and dont know if I will bother reading anymore.  Point number 1 up there made me want to stop altogether.  I wouldn't recommend this book.  I wish I could get my money back.  As lots of other reviewers have said, it's a jumbled mess 
 Next to reading "The Man in the High Castle", I was prepared to read something as deep and as drawn out as that Hugo winning quasi-science-fiction novel from the same author. "Martian Time-Slip" is described as being similar in nature to that style of writing. I also discovered "Clans of the Alphane Moon", "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" (Blade Runner), "Ubik" and "The Simulacra", all of which are 5 star reads, "Martian-Time Slip" comes highly recommended because it is in the top twenty science-fiction books, Orion Publishers and the SF Masterworks series listing it as #13 in their collection. Unfortunately I was surprised by how little I enjoyed any of it and in fact I hated a lot of it, however the author should be credited and published for creating this world, but as for reading it... well that is a totally different matter. This is an oddity, more for collectors than readers. I am glad to have it in my Philip K. Dick collection.... However, it is at the back of his collection.  Mars is populated by settlers from Earth, starting a new world there, with Bleekmen Martians, like primitive man, selling trinkets to earthlings, who mostly need clean water, which is owned by the waterworks manager, Arnie Kott, who has acquired a former mentally ill repairman, Jack Bohlen, to plug into the mind of an autistic boy, Manfred, who might be able to see the future and tell him why the UN wants to buy in on Mars soil. Jack's father arrives from Earth, turns out to be a prospector and Jack ends up double-crossing Kott, over and over again in alterative universes, until he figures what is going on and by that stage you just don't care because there is no ending, there is no science-fiction, the politics and extraterrestrial real estate scams became moot long ago, the penetration of the mysteries of being and time totally abstract to the point of meaninglessness anywhere else except in Dick's mind, then we get his over-excuse for adultery neatly wrapped in a package "Sleep with other people so that you get to know what your spouse is doing right and wrong", Dick who happens to have been married five times, really doesn't come across as that faithful to his characters and his alter-ego chews through them, mostly sexually, and quite disturbingly, ending up in a Dick book that doesn't quite have the same panache as anything I have read from him before.  Even though "Martian Time-Slip" puts forward some very interesting notions that make you think ah, here it comes, the plot or the twist, it never really does. Instead you end up with an extended soap opera on Mars, not that this is a bad idea, Dick writes good soap into his science-fiction ("Clans of the Alphane Moon" does it well), but the soap here pretty much envelops any science-fiction under all the smut and suds that come out of nowhere around page 100 and continue to dominate the later half of the book with the theories discussed in pages 70 to 100, never going anywhere, after the huge 70 page opening, yes many of you will be wasting your time, characters are introduced far too slowly, jacked around half way through the story and replaced by new characters towards the end, meaning what you have covered so far has been lost to the warping and bending of time in the story, unfortunately not working out as a good read, but maybe as good writing, and certainly Philip K. Dick can not be faulted for his literature skills, dialogue or introduction of descriptions that should have occurred towards the start of the book, we don't mind all of this, but the story thus is boring, without centre and does not deliver on a payoff like the last two or three pages of "The Man in the High Castle." It isn't like that work at all. This is a self-serving science fiction rant to explain the author's own problems with mental health and infidelity.  As many of you know Dick can be more suggestive than fleshing out those suggestions. Here he makes a suggestion that quite frankly we are not in the least bit interested in because of the way he puts it forward, that some people's mental illness can be confused with people who really have special talents, but the story boxes this concept into replaying a scene a couple of times over again in variation each time, the Martian Time-Slip explained by changes in people's perceptions, this concept comes up in the middle of the book, then takes a back seat to more suds and soap about adultery... and never emerges again. I am glad to be free of this book. That is not a good sign.  It hurts me to say this but... "Martian Time-Slip" stinks. Only get it to see into the mind of a science-fiction writer beginning to question the depths of the mind and reasons for his own unfaithfulness. If you want to learn more about Dick through his work, then certainly this has lots of insight, but the story, not even close to what he is capable of doing.  I am going to move onto "A Scanner Darkly" next. Hopefully that will go a bit better than this one did. Five stars all the way and then this bumpy ride. Only get this Philip K. Dick if you have read everything else. Comes nowhere even close to #13 place that Orion SF Masterworks gave it 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 This book is over-priced and offers little academic or practical value for lecturing Business Students. No instructor's manual available. It seems if the author took several resources and crammed it all together in one publication. I am quite disappointed with this purchase and for using this in class 
 Well, ok, Mehldau's arrangements aren't bad...He does a great version of "Paranoid Android" but otherwise...WHERE'S THE ENERGY?   There's really not a whole lot of excitement or energy in this album, and I do understand this as being a more laid back, mellowed-out album...but it is still possible to be more exciting, energetic, or emotional in this style.   All three of these things are pretty much absent from this CD which ends up making it dull.   :yawn 
 Dry and overly technical.  As an aspiring lawyer and an armchair orator, I didn't find very much that I could readily apply to the nuts and bolts of my speech writing or delivery 
 i was so disappointed in this book, it made me angry. It was the first time I ever wanted to rush out and buy a book and pay full price upon hearing reviews. People were gushing over this thing. While Messoud is a beautiful writer, I beg to differ. This was stinky chic-lit. I was insulted by the stereotypical characters and didn't really see any "twist" to them at all. I thought the use of the events of Sept 11 to be really blah. The characters don't seem to grow. they all just seem like whiny, pathetic, bougie snobs. I really expected more. Don't bother buying this book. Just drive by my house and pick it up out of the trash. 
 This is an extremely dry anime.  The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor.  Not so for the anime.  The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but, for reasons unknown, he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version. Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking.  These really make the movie crawl.  One minute there's action, next you're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism.  Seriously, these little talks, take up 3/4 of the movie. The visuals are awesome, no question about that.  Even so, they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story.  Altogether, not much actually, HAPPENS during the movie. If you must see it, rent it first to be sure you want it 
 I'm a huge fan of the Pria line, but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy.  I don't hate them, but will not buy them again.  The flavor is pretty good though, just not what I was expecting.  I highly recommend the Pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind. Thank

 There is a lot of traffic in Rome.  Especially on the "raccordo annulare", where accidents  are also frequent. The traffic is noisy and dirty, especially when it rains.  Romans swear when they drive and also when they don't.  There are many American tourists in Rome,  especially around the fountains in the piazzas,  where they cluster and sing American songs.  Italian men hit on women tourists, who resist their advances.    "Se vedi gente che lavora, allora non e` Roma".  Romans do not work. No, some of them do, and, in fact, morning till night.   But Rome is not what it used to be.  Everybody knew each other and was polite,  while now everybody is rushed and rude.  Besides, the free love of today has substituted  the brothels of yesterday.  Yes, some of the brothels were chic, while others less so.   Rome was bombed in the Second World War. In fact,  bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatrical  performance. The public then proceeded to the  shelter, where flirting and lovemaking would ensue.   The Roman aristocracy is close to the Papal Court.  They run parties together, even fashion shows.  Cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the Pope  how to rule the Church.   And, yes! Motoryclists can and do go around the  Colosseum, providing a tasteless final sequence.   One leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time.   Does Fellini really have nothing at all to say  about the Eternal City? After all his years there? Nothing except the  standard collection of stereotypes  about Italians, stereotypes that occur in every  scurrilous joke, that are met on the pages of every trashy guide?    It is true that there are a few nice sequences, especially  the often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes.    And then, the great Anna Magnani appears for about 10 seconds to tell Fellini she won't talk to him.    That is perhaps also a scene worth watching.   But the rest is commercial cinema.   "Vai a dormi', Federico".    
 I searched all over for this book. It was even recommended through a business brief published by Business Reference Services Humanities and Social Sciences Division Library of Congress in 1994. So you could only  imagine my dissappointment when I realized this book simply lists a bunch  of addresses over and over again and gives you almost nothing to go on. I  got much more out of a 35 page booklet entitled Your Guide To Free  Government Grants than I did from this over 350 page book. I truly felt  dissapointed and would not recommend this book to anyone searching for a  grant 
 This book is somewhat intriguing. It is indeed an authoritative  scholarly account of the growth of government in the United States, and for that reason only well worth reading. However, there is a pervading subtext of libertarian conspiracy theory about governmental power in the book that leaves the reader wondering if the author might not be masquerading a scholarly endeavour (that in itself is very rewarding) in order to suggest that government is the incarnation of evil. The fundamental truth which is developed here, that there is a permanent and necessary contradiction between the development of governmental power and individual liberty is unsophisticated, not to say outright crude. In addition, the author's thesis that after each crisis resulting in the growth of governmental capacities and power the government  (always conceptualized as a large undifferentiated whole in the book) tends to rationalize its subsequent business in order not to loose what it just gained is not a discovery of the highest order. This is the rule in every institutional setting, whether corporate or bureaucratic,  we know that since Max Weber's work on bureaucracy, without the libertarian hogwash 
 Chuck Jones continues to entertain new audiences with the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo. I found it to be very exciting. If you have Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote The Classic Chase from Warner Bros. Golden Jubiliee 24 Karat collection, this video might not be for you. The other five cartoons actually appear on that video; Zip N' Snort, Operation: Rabbit, Hook, Line and Stinker, Beep Beep, and Ready, Woolen and Able. Otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages 
 The art of writing and negotiation has come a long way since the ole Herb wrote this book. His stories present him as an argumentative, cheap, old-fashioned man with a distant relationship with his wife.  His first kibble of advice is to annoy a salesperson at a one-price store (read as "department store") until they eventually agree to knock a few bucks off the price. I guess this supposed millionaires time is not that expensive 
 This may be the Second edition of the book, but too many of the so called sports and games are outdated or totally impractical for school use. 
 ...you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library.  If you want to get an "inside view" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!  What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.  The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!  I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.  But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.  I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed.. 
 Unfotrunately Shantaram did not grab my imagination at all.  Nor did I find it emotionally satisfying.  I realize Shataram is meant to be a kind of Bollywood story - over the top, flowery, cliched etc. but the Bollywood movies I've seen have been engaging and strangely satisfying, despite their soppyness etc.  Shantaram was not engaging because the poor writing and shallow characters spoil the story.  
 A real eye-opener: with all sincerity, I cannot believe Simon and Schuster has published this under the aegis of "Simon and Schuster Children Publishing." The language is execrable, the text jammed with f--- and sh-- and d---. In the early pages the seventeen-year-old protagonist walks in on her boyfriend's amorous dealings with the girl's own mother. And after she hooks up with street youth we are treated to a thorough detailing of  the materials and the methods of intravenous drug use (only this girl isn't really sure exactly what she's cheerily pumping into her veins), dumpster diving, vandalism, breaking and entering, theft, the tale of a man trying to blind a boy by crushing his eyeball with his thumb, scavenging leftovers from deserted restaurant tables and other like diversions. According to the publisher's website, Ms. Black is a favorite among kids. What I hate most is that these demeaning elements in the story are gratuitous: without them, the book might just be a worthwhile read because of its ingenious world of trolls, tree women, and "faeries." I can see how teenagers would agree that the "world would be cooler with something so unreal in it." As it is, I cannot imagine recommending it to a teen--or anyone else-- to read 
 While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous.  While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read.  It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe.  Even the school principal lacked some Ooommmph if you know what I mean.  The grandmother was a good role, but the parents coud have been much more important.  So overall, let's call it a quick read, funny and enjoyable, but not one of his best.  I picked it up at the airport and read it on the very same trip.  Not one I would keep, so back it went with the 50% return offer the airport here has 
 The only great thing about "The Great Fire" is its name.  This is one of those books that as you read it, you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute, the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield, about the dog, that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet, which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been...but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war Japan and the Australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager, or was the chap British...and the she, the bosses wife, who strangely winked at you during the last Christmas party and you felt like choking...he must have been Australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in Australia...but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read...but who really cares whether the Australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other, after all the world really changed since 1947...and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to `Stanley Steamer' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression...But back to the book! If you love British style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps (with names like Bertram and Aldred) get together to have some tea, then in their spare time write long romantic letters, and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2, this is the book for you. If you are like me, meaning you have so much on your mind that it'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages, then I highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 Interesting premise...but no meat...no sense of physical place...almost all dialogue and that thin and not interesting enough to be memorable OR to fill in the story...thought I'd give it a second reading just to be fair...same/same...  Don't waste your money   
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 I have read every Leaphorn/Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan. I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend.. we both agreed it was so disappointing.. we cannot believe it was written by the same person. The writing was awkward and heavy-handed... by the second page I suspected something was wrong here. It reads like some cheap Harlequin mystery/romance. The sensitive handling of Navajo spiritual beliefs, the beautiful rendering of the landscape, the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing.  All I can say is, the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of Tony Hillerman's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye... he has given us much enjoyment.... he deserves better.  And if someone else is fleshing out Hillerman's plot lines.. the public should be warned 
  I haven't seen a movie so one-sided since the Contender. They didn't even try to make good arguments for the pro-gun side. I hate to use the term Liberal Bias but in this case it fits like a glove. The cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie I felt like the gun companies were the underdogs. Pure garbage.   
 This is the kind of film I typically enjoy, even if others consider it average at best.  Oddly enough, though, the tables have been turned when it comes to Lady in the Water.  Frankly, I just didn't find this to be a very good film.  The story had potential, certainly, but M. Night Shyamalan's script, which involved way too many people coming together and accepting a most extraordinary story far too easily, is decidedly weak and flimsy.  And while I certainly understand that the events that play out convey many a metaphorical meaning, too much of what I saw seemed to be made up as things went along.  And for something that supposedly originated with a bedtime story for Shyamalan's kids, it's so bloated with characters and plays so fast and loose with the few rules most fairy tales actually follow that it loses its appeal pretty quickly.  So, basically, what you have here is a sea nymph (Bryce Dallas Howard) named Story showing up in the dirty swimming pool of a seedy motel housing a really diverse range of tenants, from a grumpy, generally silent old man to Chinese immigrants to a film critic to a bodybuilder who only works out on one side of his body, etc.  Story is discovered by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the building superintendent, a good-natured soul and just about the only sympathetic character anywhere in the vicinity of this film.  He takes Story in and slowly learns her story: she's a Narf who has left the Great Ocean temporarily on an important mission to change man's destiny, and she has to avoid some nasty Scrunts who want to stop her and prevent the Great Eatlon from carrying her back home - and, by the way, there's another creature called the Tartutic who scares the heck out of Scrunts.  And what is this grand mission?  She has to communicate a silent message to a young writer, played by none other than Shyamalan himself, whose book will basically save the world some day.  It's not hard to see why some critics point to Shyamalan's ego having run totally amuck, especially given the fact he included in the story an unlikable film critic mouthing only clichés for no plot-related reason (but obviously for personal - not to mention childish - reasons).  One must remember that Shyamalan threw a hissy fit and took his fairy tale elsewhere when the perceptive folks at Disney pointed out that the story needed some serious revising.  In the end, I'm afraid I have to agree with those who see Lady in the Water as a misguided product of Shyamalan's ego and filmmaking arrogance.  Talk about metaphors all you like, but the film's plot is basically nonsense.  At one point, Story - who can see the future - refuses to help all of her new friends by telling them who is supposed to represent whom, but she does agree to do the Yes-No thing when they ask her questions.  That's the kind of thing you expect to see in a sit-com long after it has already jumped the shark.  And I still can't figure out why everyone in the motel bought into Story's story so easily.  Paul Giamatti turns in a brilliant performance, but that's about the only thing Lady in the Water has going for it 
 The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat "hero" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed 
 Unfortunately, this interesting bit of history relies on fictional details to support its larger claims. There is documentation about the falsities in this volume that came to light at David Irvings libel trial in London that removes any value to this book other than the interesting and fascinating way that Mr. Irving is able to weave his stories. If you like other WWII fiction you might enjoy this. If you are looking for REAL history then you are better off reading Goebbels diary entries in their original German than relying on David Irvings misguided attempt to channel the Third Reichs thinkers in this book 
 I appreciate anyone's attempts to examine the deeper nature of life and share that with the rest of us. However, I could see a hole in Csikszentmihalyi's attempt from the beginning.   "In the course of my studies I tried to understand as exactly as possible how people felt when they most enjoyed themselves, and why. My first studies involved a few hundred "experts"--artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons, in other words, people who seem to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred."  I'm surely not alone in wondering why on earth one would presume the above professions are strictly happy and "optimal experience". Particularly the reference to artists and musicians, who typically have severe struggles with life, and aren't on cloud nine just because some professors might like them in a couple hundred years. That is what I felt was the very weak point of the book--a study of happiness with almost no reference to unhappiness.   It goes on to talk about ways to find flow in our ordinary life, while dodging the bullet continually about why if flow was all those great people needed, did they still encounter countless problems and unhappiness. 
 This test isn't very accurate and it takes forever to do. I bought the book for an IRI project I had in class. Some of the scoring issues are not clear and students may score lower when they just don't feel like reading or if they don't feel like paying attention. This may be true for other tests also, but is much more apparent with this. It may be good to use this book as an assessment tool, but do not use the test scores when it comes to the student's records or IEP 
 I will preface this review with the fact that I come from a perspective extremely critical of U.S. foreign policy and of its constant wars ("low-intensity" conflict, the "war on drugs," the wars on oil-containing nations, and the War o[f] Terrorism). Now you know where I'm coming from. That said:  It appears Mr. Maher was stung quite painfully when Ari Fleischer, Bush's then-press-secretary, singled him out for denunciation after Maher said on his talk show, Politically Incorrect, that, whatever the 9/11 hijackers were, they were not cowards. As a result, the stricken Mr. Maher lost his show.  He appears to have decided to respond to this downturn with a frothing-at-the-mouth, wrapped-in-the-flag nationalist rant, curiously intermingled with a platterful of liberal (and sometimes even radical) argumentation in regard to the injustices and inanities in U.S. foreign and domestic policy. Inbetween his rants, he makes excellent points in terms of "why they hate us," and in our (the people's) complicity with the crimes of empire. But, without fail, he returns to anti-enemies-of-the-state and anti-Islam polemics, eerily reminiscent of the "Hate Week" histrionics against Goldstein, Orwell's official enemy of the state in _1984_.  It is apparent that he is trying to vindicate himself by criticizing the "war on terrorism" from an ardent pro-war and pro-empire position.  But Maher, in this book, did not just fall into line in response to his chastening. He decided to attempt to be one of the ideological drill instructors of the punditry, calling for his critics (and, of course, the rest of us) to fall into line as well -- but be nicer about it. In essence, it seems as if he is trying to bark as loudly as his avowedly-right-wing counterparts as he co-opts their position.  It's an extremely ambivalent book -- he makes many excellent points and raises many important issues not raised by mainstream pundits (as other reviewers here have indicated). I recognize this, and it is indeed good. But, the problem is that the overall message undermines these arguments and smothers them in soothing generalities that, in turn, smother critical thought.  In his conclusion, he denounces all critics of American foreign policy and empire, self-righteously reaffirming the conservative line that America's is the gentlest bloody-handed empire (my not-so-complimentary interpretation) in history, and therefore is praiseworthy. Of course, Chileans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, Vietnamese, Haitians, Iraqis, Venezuelans, Grenadans, Cubans, the Timorese, and so on, would disagree. His quasi-historical concluding polemic, naturally, fails to substantiate itself, but rather speaks in sweeping, comfortable generalizations that pamper our traditional self-image and, in effect, reaffirm the conservative line. In the end, he becomes one of the best assets the neoconservatives could ask for -- an impassioned "liberal" who, in effect, argues their case but merely whines about methodology. A splendid example of false consciousness in action.  (Incidentally, this friendliness to the conservative worldview is confirmed by the praise received from self-avowed "conservatives" and rightists in these reviews, and from none other than Ann Coulter in her glowing comment quoted on the back cover of the book. If you ever hear conservatives call someone a "reasonable liberal," that should raise some flags.)  When it comes down to it, he is a privileged member of the upper echelons of the corporate media establishment, and he responded hysterically to an outright threat to his ability to stay there. Rather pathetic to observe, really. However, the neocons and "regular" cons can surely enjoy the thrust of his book

 when i bought movie thought i would see more than one arab biased anti american news media...... 
 I had to read this in school as a kid. The actual writing talent here is great but the subject matter is really depressing. I think a good story should have a nice balance of good/bad events. Steinbeck has none of that in this book. The Red Pony is just one dark cloud of doom throghout the entire book. Things go from bad to worse as the little boy's dreams are shattered. Some parts of it are also needlessly gross and bloody and I must admit that as a kid I was a little emotionally scarred from it! The book goes ubruptly to a totally different and unrelated story. As an adult I know it's meant to serve as some sort of metaphor but I still don't like this book and think it's a pointless read unless you want to be depressed or have a thing for tragic stories. I know it's supposed to be a classic, the problem is I don't know WHY! Some readers say "this is a great book for readers of all ages" but I would have to disagree! I don't think this is a kids book. I don't think kids should be forced to read this at school and I don't think I would ever read it again. 
 The first Wild Things had pretty good actors and an original story line. The second one was tolerable and still had hot chicks in it with a tich of an original storyline. Though it was far to close to the original storyline. Quite honestly the third one follows the exact same plot as the second one and I mean scene by scene close. Rich girl, step father, school auditorium scene, courtrooms, threesome. The only thing that made this movie worth anytime was the threesome. Perfect bodies on the girls that star in this film. Quite honestly I have no idea how they got anyone to agree to this project. It was horrible, It's amazing how many good shows get canceled but movies like this get made 
 This is a typical thriller involving a deadly virus which is a cross between a hanta virus and Ebola and causes a fatal version of ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome).  There doesn't appear to be much effort on the part of the authors to be realistic.  People have already commented on the dialog which sounds like a poorly made "made for TV movie." but the book shows a total lack of understanding of the subject matter in most areas.  An unknown lethal virus is loose in the world and when the first 3 patients die and bleed out the regular hospitals do autopsies and send the material to AMRID.  They have recognized the situation might in involve a hemorrhagic virus even at the local hospital level, but they do the autopsies to get the material to send to AMRID in an ordinary morgue rather than a level 4 containment area (the book doesn't deal with the contamination issues at the local hospitals and there would have been serious ones.  Also for some reason the media doesn't get the story at any of the 3 widely separated hospitals.)   At AMRID latter in the book they are treating it as a level 4 contagion (like Ebola and smallpox ).  A team sneaks into the lab to remove material and to kill a scientist who "knows too much."  They kill her by injecting her with a large dose of the  mutated virus (normally this virus is dormant like HIV for a long period of time before it acts up and kills the infected person.  Also it takes longer to kill those in the west because of better health, medical care and according the authors genetics)   The bad guys are a rogue pharmaceutical company who have the cure and now they need to create the epidemic).  There is no way it would kill a person in the hour or so that it does in the book.  It takes a while to build up the necessary virus load throughout the body to do the amount of damage this virus does in its final phase.    After the female scientist is left for dead where she would have been easily discovered she somehow survives long enough  to drive home (condo she recently sold but hasn't fully moved out of) where her fiancé is waiting. She collapses and he calls an ambulance and she is taken to a normal hospital (he doesn't know about the virus).  The hospital who does know about the virus keeps her in a normal room and when she dies they do the autopsy at the hospital in a normal morgue without level 4 containment equipment.   Remember this is a level 4 lethal virus that is unlike anything anyone has seen before and they don't know whether it's airborne (most hanta viruses are airborne) nor how contagious it is.   No one in their right mind would have had her in a normal hospital room even in an oxygen tent and do an autopsy in a normal morgue in a local hospital.  By the time you get to this point in the book there probably are a dozen other problems like the ones I've mentioned and new ones pop up with a regularity all through the book that exceeds almost any other book I've ever read by a long ways.  I can't recommend this book to anyone because of problems like these and the awful dialog.   
 This is the only Robert Crais novel I ever read that I didn't like.  I had to push myself to finish it.  It features all the minutia about bank robbing --it's like the author read a book on the subject--  and the least likeable characters he's ever created.    Spare yourself the annoyance of reading this and read "The Watchman" instead.  
 I have read this book (and its companion volume) a couple of times, and to be honest I am not a fan.  Many of Jan Fennell's suggestions are useful, but none are original.   Ms Fennell's method is based on the idea of using the non-violent language of the wolf pack to put your dog in his rightful subordinate place, and therefore gain his understanding and cooperation.  Alpha wolves eat first - so Ms Fennell has the dog owner eat dinner before his dog.  Alpha wolves take the pack out hunting - so we are bid to walk our dogs daily.  Alpha wolves aren't demonstrative - so we are told to ignore our dogs for five minutes each time we arrive home from work.  These suggestions are sensible, but they are hardly revolutionary.  Maintaining dominant status by behaving like an "alpha" wolf is a technique that has been championed by many other authors - the only difference is that Ms Fennell gives this process the cutesy name of "Amichien bonding".  The technique is a good one for restoring a relationship with a dog that has been spoiled or confused in the past by weak or misinformed owners. Its success lies not only in the owner mimicking canine behaviour, but also in the institution of house rules and a predictable daily routine for the dog.    So what is wrong with this book?  The first fatal flaw is the unrealistic simplicity of the method.  Ms Fennell seems to believe that all canine behavioural problems are caused by the dog wishing to be alpha.  It is certainly true that a dog with a misplaced sense of his own importance will probably become a problem dog.  However, dogs can also behave badly for a plethora of other reasons - poor training, learned fear, boredom, health issues, confusion and inherent high prey drive, to name just a few.  Ms Fennell's insistence that all canine problems are dominance problems that can be cured by "Amichien bonding" is unfortunately just not realistic.       For a professional dog trainer, Ms Fennel also displays a rather disturbing lack of knowledge about several dog breeds.  At one point she states that it may be impossible to fully train Bull Terriers "and dogs of this type" due to their inherent "savage natures"!  One gets the impression that she has been unable to train this type of dog herself and holds a grudge about it.  Whatever the reason, I find it somewhat disingenuous of her to ignore the fact that other trainers have managed to train these breeds to very high standards, and blame her own failure to do so on the dogs instead of on her own methods.  In short?  If you know very little about dog behaviour and have a mildly pushy dog, then this book isn't a bad buy.  Certainly, applying the "Amichien bonding" advice won't hurt.  It is the same type of programme as recommended by dog behaviourists the world over (you can get much of the same information for free on the internet, from Shirley Chong's website for example).    However, Ms Fennell's book is not a comprehensive guide to solving every dog's problems.  If your dog has moderate to serious behavioural problems, save your money and book a consultation with a professional behaviourist.  Your dog will thank you for it.   
 I don't want this to be misconstrued as a knock on the author, because I think he's a great author and a great writer.  I'm simply critiquing this particular book on what it's done for me...and that's not very much.  This book works if you've never written anything in your life and know absolutely nothing about writing, otherwise it's a bit of a waste of time.  It didn't offer me anything that I could learn from that I couldn't get from something else.  If I have to read another book that goes on and on about how the first thing about writing is you have to write, you have to write a lot and you also have to read a lot.  Forgive me, but I think most educated or even semi-intelligent people know that whatever your passion is, whatever you want to do in life, you have to do it.  Most don't need to be told.  You're already doing it because you love it, hence why you want to do it forever.  We don't need to be talked down to like an idiot and that's the problem with some of these thespian overly educated writers, is that their snobs and they write in a way that is condescending.  They are basically saying it's this way or forget it your wasting your time.  They didn't invent writing.  Writing has been around for centuries.  This book strongly emphasizes how important it is to outline and that you'll be doing it for the rest of your life, but it doesn't give you clear and excellent examples of something so critical.  Instead it gives you sample charts of time travel from his science fiction books.  If I had to hear one more comparison about what this author did with his science fiction books I was going to throw the book out the window.  I was really hoping for more actual writing tips on grammar and sentence structure, but no such luck.  I do have a couple fantastic writing books that I loved and I found to be absolutely beneficial and they are....  "Bird by Bird" by Annie Lamott and "On Writing" by Stephen King. Both of those books were funny and witty, entertaining and packed with very informative and helpful tips for the writer in you. They are much more evolved writing books to check out and help you get better at doing what you love most 
 Why would anyone bother to read this when there is the lonely planet guide available? This is in my opinion a vastly inferior guide when compared not just to lonely planet but to many of the others available, it lacks  organisation and detail 
 It tells about conventional stretching (but claims to be different) only which one can find for free in many websites. A big waste of money. Moreover, it gives non tracable references.  For stretching I would suggest-- "Stretching" by Bob Anderson for beginners and then  "Stretching scientifically" by Thomas Kur 
 My 4-year-old son LOVED The Berenstain Bears' New Baby and it was a big help in preparing for the arrival of his baby sister.  So when we were struggling with remembering manners, I bought this book, certain that it would help.  However, I ended up disagreeing with the approach to correcting bad or forgotten manners and rude behavior.  This book outlined specific chores as punishments for various offenses. As parents, we have learned that allowing children to help around the house with things like sweeping, taking out the garbage, and helping Mommy empty the dishwasher (the plastic stuff!) is very empowering and makes kids feel like they can contribute to the household and they enjoy being part of the "family team" (hopefully this will continue into their teens since we've started them as toddlers!).   Also, I learned that I should probably read through any new book by myself at least once before sitting down to read it to my children (parents can learn too!).  Just a thought 
 Author Kevin Murphy, of course, was a writer/performer on the cult TV hit, "Mystery Science Theater 3000." As such, you'd think he'd have the sort of insight and humor that would make this book a great read for movie fans.  Unfortunately, though, Murphy spends most of his Year whining about contemporary moviegoing. Okay, so we know that multiplexes suck. We know that theater food is both bad and overpriced. We know that most modern movies suck, too. Murphy is right to point these things out, but he dwells on them page after page with little of the wit one might expect. And in his eagerness to knock even the better aspects of American cinema (dissing both "Pulp Fiction" and Jerry Lewis, for instance) while singing the praises of the most obscure of foreign documentaries, Murphy comes off as more movie snob than movie fan. To top it all off, there's an air of political correctness in much of Murphy's writing that turns up the smug factor. This was a great idea for a book, but it's neither as funny as you want it to be nor as definitive a comment on the current state of cinema as Murphy may have wanted it to be. A disappointment. 
                   [Sadly, many readers base their votes as to                how helpful a review is, on whether it agrees                with their own views. Few non-conservatives                would even bother reading reviews of a book                like this!]    If you are a dyed-in-the-wool conservative merely looking for a feel-good experience in the form of an endless diatribe against liberals, this book is for you. Read no further. Buy the book.  If, however, you are interested in solving the social problems that face our country today, and want to learn about the various merits and pitfalls of programs and suggestions for solving those problems, then you should forget this book and go in search of an author who cares at least as much about solving the problems as she does about dumping on liberals--because that's all you'll get here.   Anybody can blather endlessly on what's broken; but to impress me, you have to suggest a better way--or at least give me the impression you actually care about resolving the problems in the first place. The problems historical to our welfare system, for example, are no secret to anyone. But hats off to those who care enough to keep trying to get it right. For her obvious lack of empathy, I can only assume MacDonald is among those many conservatives who, having gotten theirs, see no need for any form of welfare whatsoever, under any circumstance, and simply want it to disappear altogether. Such people say they would gladly help anyone "truly" in need--it's just that they can't imagine anyone ever actually being "truly" in need, because, to them, anyone in need is simply lazy.  I am light years from being a left wing extremist, and I am absolutely FOR welfare reform, but I certainly know better than to cite examples of thirteen-year-old children to illustrate how people should be left to suffer the consequences of their irresponsible behaviors. What heartless fundamentalism! If you cannot understand how not having a decent parent can foster "irresponsible" behavior in a child--a child!, and demand that that child basically be left abandoned to her deserved punishment, then you have nothing meaningful to say. If your tough love isn't based on love, it is worthless.  One of the 13-year-old children MacDonald discusses is a girl who was pregnant due to rape (not due to personal irresponsibility). Her siblings and parents were living horror stories of drugs and violence. Social workers sought to place the girl with other relatives, where she would have a more suitable environment for success. Instead of lauding those efforts, MacDonald's gripe about this case is that no one forced the girl to give up her baby. That there was no irresponsible behavior on the girl's part mattered not to MacDonald. The young woman should be made to suffer--for the rapist's irresponsibility, I guess.   MacDonald takes every opportunity to depict the poor (and of course these would be the "undeserving" poor, since that is all she concerns herself with) in the worst possible light--anything to make any form of welfare look silly. If you are bright enough to understand that welfare is intended for the truly needy, not the "undeserving," and wonder how MacDonald would address the needs of a responsible person who is truly in need through some unfortunate circumstance beyond the person's control, don't hold your breath. She doesn't even acknowledge a need, and the last thing she would do in this book is to cite an example that might support even a conservative program to help the poor.  The author cites projects that were clearly experimental, titled as such and referred to by MacDonald herself as experimental. Yet she then goes on at length to announce, as if bringing some great revelation to our attention, what failures they were. You'd think somebody was trying to incorporate them into routine policy! If nobody, or only a handful of extremists that no one is listening to, is arguing for something, why the pompous declarations? Answer: the point is to ridicule liberals, not find solutions.  I heard this book in audio format, while traveling, and every few sentences, I could only blurt out, "But...!" because of the lapses of logic or, more frequently, important parts of the discussion totally ignored. What about the "deserving" needy? Or the "undeserving" needy who are, nevertheless, needy? Do we just let them starve? (MacDonald would not permit begging.) Maybe letting them starve is an argument of merit, but MacDonald only tells us how broken things are, she doesn't address solutions nor even outline what she sees as the problems--if any.  She spends a chapter scoffing at the notion that homeless people would like to be housed. A study showed that many of them did not. Okay, that is a good thing to know, and it will inform our homeless policies. But again, don't hold your breath for MacDonald to discuss those who *do* need and want housing. Go to work for any homeless shelter (according to a friend who worked for several) and you will find cases of bright, formerly well-employed people who lost everything (often due to illness of a spouse). What about them? It is a non-issue with MacDonald, who finds it easier, and perhaps more fun, to scoff at those who care and try and make mistakes and try again. Nor does she address the endlessly botched (and largely conservative-based) healthcare policy in the U.S. and how it might directly relate to homelessness.  Some of her strongest ridicule is reserved for anyone who would think self-esteem is important enough to pay any attention to, when we develop school policy. Again, anyone can cite the most absurdly extreme examples of experimental efforts. But isn't it equally absurd to suggest the choice has to be all or nothing? Hey, if *I* didn't need anyone to help foster self esteem in me, then why should some 9-year-old black kid who didn't have a father and who's mother was a junkie need it? I got *my* caring parents, you get yours!  When MacDonald talks about the horrors of our museums trying to make their displays more diverse and inclusive, it frankly sounds like sour grapes. I mean, curators got a clue and started fixing things... damn! Even if (big IF) some museums have overcompensated in their laudable efforts toward balanced and inclusive presentations, she can't bring herself even to hint that perhaps indeed there was a problem to start with. Her attitude is like that of whites who complain that we don't have a "White Awareness Month." (In fact, in one of her examples, she complains that if a white student had written the same kind of essay that a black student had written, there would be outrage. Is that the extent of her rational insight and maturity?) If museums have erred on the side of too much diversity, after a couple of hundred years of erring on the side of too little, how bothered can a sane person get? Tweak the solution and move on! At this point it actually crossed my mind that MacDonald could be an "angry straight white man" using a pseudonym! We white males had it so good for so many years, and now that the scales tip a little closer to balance--or, God forbid, half an ounce too far--the sky is falling!   One need not wonder whether MacDonald ever got as bent out of shape over too LITTLE diversity and minority representation as she does over her irrational fear that such issues might now be slightly overstated rather than grossly understated.  There is no question that caring can go too far, or, better put, that many things that have been tried haven't worked or need tweaking. No one disputes it. But what is the point of announcing, almost with apparent glee, that something didn't work? A meaningful, worthwhile work would discuss the problems themselves and attempt to make another inch-worth of progress toward resolving them. To imply that the old ways were just fine doesn't cut it for me.  I have a longstanding commitment to hearing all sides, and that's why I endured this marathon rant. It was largely a waste of time, because I already knew what was wrong. The only reason the book rates a star is that you do learn some history, some details about the things that were wrong--which can be interesting for the learning, if not for a solution. The only reason for an undeserved second star is to keep from looking like an extremist that people won't bother to read. Other reviewers who gave this book only one or two stars are right on the mark. They say it better than I. Take a look at them.  As for the audio version, the reader drones about as much as one possibly could. The only excitement or change in tone seems to be in direct quotes when she livens up to make a minority person sound as dumb as she can, or to make an opposing view sound as silly as possible. Count on a lot of coffee if you want to stay on the road with this one. 
 Recently I've been doing research on oral contraceptives and their hormonal basis and I picked up this book because I thought it might have something to tell me about how the pill worked. Of course the book has no such thing. The words "estriadol" and "progestin" the two main components of the pill are not even in the index. The book is a collection of anectodal complaints from women about their experiences with the pill without any basis in science or medicine. Seamen doesn't even talk about how the side effects reported could have been caused by the pill, she simply reports them as fact. There are interviews with laypeople, doctors, and psychologists but there are absolutely no references located in this book from peer reviewed scientific journals. She does describe some scientific studies but completely skews the results. Basically this book is unscientific, sensationalistic, and poorly written 
 Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned.  I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.  But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't.  By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....  The script is idiot from page one. The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.  But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break.  Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.  Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.  Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????  Want more?  In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???  In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).  First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive. Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.  We have none of that here.  Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.  Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.  But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under "The story ends bad" label. Without any depth.  Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end.  What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the "this is an open-ending" kind of talk!  Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel? Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: "Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!"  Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great. 
 ...when they cut out the instrumental portion of "Angry Eyes"? I was furious when I discovered that fact after buying the CD ( I got it before reading the reviews here). Yeah, yeah, some of their other nuggets like "Vahevala" are here, but messing up "Angry Eyes" totally tripped me out. Save your money unless you have no use for "Angry Eyes" but if you ask me (well, you didn't, but I'll say it anyway), that's the magnum opus of this band 
 I enjoyed the parts regarding the S.S. Valiant, but the later part of the book simply didn't work for me. Except for Picard, who we of course know quite well from the series, the other characters were flat and uninteresting. We never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week, boring. The whole "adversarial" situation with the 1st Officer also just struck me as odd and wrong, and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for Picard 
 Restall's conclusions add nothing to what Tzvetan Todorov has already said in The Conquest of America-which Seven Myths gets wrong in its dismissal of Todorov's crucial point about the role of writing in the Conquest.  Merely being able to put information down on paper isn't the issue.  What Todorov means is much more complex, and is grounded in evidence from anthropology to neuroscience (e.g., Ong, Goody, Havelock, Panksepp).  First, with written words fixed in front of you, you can re-read, check for inconsistencies, compare to other accounts to assess accuracy and consider alternatives, even elaborate.  You, in fact, practice thinking skills you have little opportunity to develop unless literate.  Restall also sees no reason to prefer an alphabetic system over, say, Aztec pictographs that interpreters used to recall memorized speeches embodying the culture.  But only with an alphabet can you unambiguously set down every single thing a person can think; and only then can an idea be fully worked out and fully critiqued.  Evidence shows that the way you think when you internalize an alphabetic written language is significantly more abstract, analytical, and adaptable than when you rely primarily on speech.  Second, as Restall claims, "disease," "native disunity," "Spanish steel," and "the culture of war," are causes of the Aztec defeat, but, as Todorov rightly argues, they are only the immediate causes.  Underlying them is the ability to productively command signs (whether words or behaviors)-an ability that hinges on writing.  It's because the Spaniards had an extensive body of written knowledge that they had steel.  It's because of Cortés' writing-based innovative thinking that he could exploit information about the "native" situation to win allies.  It's because of the Aztecs' speech-based tradition-dominated thinking that they didn't see the Spaniards as a dangerous new breed of enemy that needed to be dispatched-long before smallpox arrived with a later expedition-and didn't effectively adapt battle conventions to fight this new, unpredictable enemy.  Aztec society, as Todorov emphasizes, was NOT inferior to Spanish society in any absolute way.  The Aztecs clearly had a complex and highly successful culture.  But, at that moment in history, faced with a new kind of enemy shaped by written language, they did not successfully compete.  Restall uncritically dismisses Todorov's argument instead of getting it straight 
 It's a shame that books this bad can't be returned for a refun 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 For the most part, the author seems to have pretty  good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the  book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus  indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs.  Problem: no  tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and  a half after the writing. Aside from that and a few other points, though,  the book is good reading 
 I ordered the magazine and immediately received my first issue, but unfortunately over the course of the year I only received a total of THREE issues! The magazine is great, but I wonder what the problem is. I have no received much help from amazon or Modern Bride. Guess I learned my lesson not to subscribe online anymore. 
 Robert A. Heinleins novel "Starship Troopers" still creates controversy, generations after it was first published. Indeed, the well-known movie "Starship Troopers" was actually a veiled criticism of the book!   Is Heinlein's book racist or fascist? Is it a Cold War allegory? Is it anti-democratic and militarist? How does this novel square with Heinlein's reputation for being a libertarian and near-hippie? These questions are still being hotly debated.   "Starship Troopers" describe a future society in which only people who have served in the military enjoy full citizenship rights. Only honorably discharged soldiers have the right to vote and run for office. Strangely enough, the non-citizens enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of worship and the right to start businesses. Heinlein's future society thus looks like modern America, but with a Marine Corps-like military caste superimposed on top. In the novel, humanity wages a never-ending war against several races of intelligent space aliens, including the collectivist Arachnids, who resemble spiders. Many people take the Arachnids to be a symbol for Communism in general or Red China in particular. Imperial Japan is another possibility.   Heinlein's novel attempts to solve that ancient question: how can a society make sure that the best people serve in office? This question is particularly acute in democracies, where anyone can stand for office, and everyone can vote. Heinlein's solution is to limit the franchise to those who have served in the military. In this way, only the best are selected for the job. And those willing to put their lives on the line must be the best. But does that really solve the problem?   A military is not necessarily a good administrator or politician. The best in times of peace might be different from the best in times of war. Heinlein's system only works if a total and never-ending war is raging. Indeed, the war against the Arachnids certainly seem to be such. But if so, it's naive to expect freedom of speech or extensive rights for non-citizens. The system would become a military dictatorship pure and simple, like in the movie "Starship Troopers".   The soldiers in the novel are probably inspired by the philosopher-kings and Guardians of Plato's "Republic". After rigorous military training, the officers are given courses in moral philosophy, history and politics. But there are also similiarities with ancient Athenian democracy. Every citizen of ancient Athens was expected to serve in the army or navy. There was a connection between rights and duties. But note that many non-citizens in Athens were slaves!   Ultimately, "Starship Troopers" is unconvincing, even naive. You simply cannot give political power to the military, no matter how the military is recruited, and expect everything else to stay the same.  
 I've been cutting myself since I was 14, now I'm 24. I'm currently writing my own book about self-injury and personally I felt this book was boring. I pushed myself to continue to read it and by the end of the book it ended up being just another book on my shelf.  I wouldn't recommend this book to people, self-injurers or non-self-injurers.  I believe the stories that were told within the book had a lot of the same storyline. I would've liked to have read different types of stories. The majority of the stories were about those who were abused. Not every self-injurer was abused. Some just had troubling pasts like myself that weren't able to cope with life.

 I bought this hoping for wise advice on financial matters. I instead found this book to be 200 pages of talk without substance. The points it makes (dont retire, quit work, die broke) are remade over and over in different ways without much of any intelligent argument as to why or how. I felt the book was not worth a read at all and was just a bunch of fluff to make up 200 pages. It was poorly organized as well with different subjects per each chapter. For example chap. 8 is "Accountants" through chapter 46 is a one page chapter on "Savings Accounts." I couldnt believe how many words were used that never said anything. Blah 
 Robert Anton Wilson predicted repeatedly since the 1970's, including in this book, that we would have seen the conquest of aging and death by now. The reality check he experienced in January 2007 suggests that people should deeply discount his value as a visionary "futurist" from now on. 
 I bought four of these and returned them immediately. Two were dead out of the box. A third had horrible sound.  After searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products I finally settled on the 900 Megahertz Wireless Intercom from Radio Shack. (43-3102)  Beautiful sound. Well made and about half the price of the Reporter. Pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet. So if you need more than 300 feet for range it's something to consider. Better warranty than the Reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year.  Anyway I couldn't be happier with the RS intercom. I just can't recommend the Reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty 
 I usually buy Madonna's maxi singles without hearing them simply  because there's bound to be at least a few remixes I end up liking. But this, to me, is just a poor choice for a single to begin with, and the remixes I have heard....what can I say...I'm just not feeling this one. The PSB mix is flat and thin, sucking what little energy the orignal had right out it. And the Oakenfold mix is just so obviously his - I knew it after about 20 seconds when I heard it on the radio. His remixes have an unmistakable sound, much like Junior Vasquez mixes, and often use what sounds like the same rhythm tracks and drum fills. The bottom line - remixes should make me want to go straight to the dancefloor, and  these just  make me want to head to the bar. AVOID 
 I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this book, was yet another dread.  The instructions were, at times unclear, and my result was not up to par.  Though the pictures are astounding, especially the cover picture, don't let your eyes, or your tastebuds longing for the food, decieve you 
 The best way of persuading people to accept misinformation is to mix it with some credible information. And so Dore Gold demonstrates with this anti-U.N. screed.   Not an adamant fan of the U.N. myself, I began my reading already familiar with organization's questionable track record, replete with institutional corruption and bureaucratic ineptitude. This book, I hoped, might use the ample failures of the U.N. to issue a fair indictment and perhaps show the way to a more accountable and responsible international body.   What I got instead was propaganda from a former Israeli ambassador with an extremely large political axe to grind. Instead of allowing his conclusions to be dictated by the facts, Gold seems bent on ramming a pre-packaged conclusion down readers' throats -- that the U.N. "fans the flames of chaos" and "supports terrorism and terrorists" -- by selectively cherry-picking anecdotal cases, removing them from their political context, and hoping that most readers know so little about his examples that they will leap blindly from his shaky evidence to his conclusion.    Moreover, his decision to use the hashest possible language in accusing the U.N. of abetting terrorism and spreading chaos seems to reveal a personal hostility to the U.N.  This is, of course, speculation.  But what is not speculation is that the quality of his argument is lacking, perhaps due to the fact that it issues from a visceral reaction rather than a rational analysis.  As already stated, his thesis itself is questionable.  Rather than to accuse the U.N. of worthlessly neglecting to handle international crises in an adequate manner, Gold is adamant that the U.N. actually goes beyond that and *contributes* to the crises, chaos, and terrorism.  As a later reviewer notes, Gold specifically states, "**By not adequately dealing with** the conflict in Bosnia, the UN fueled the Balkan crisis, which eventually spilled over into Kosovo and Macedonia. The failures in Rwanda fueled a massive central African war in which five nations invaded the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where approximately 2.5 million people died in the next four years. And as Iraq flagrantly violated UN resolutions on [WMDs], Libya, Iran, and North Korea ignored the UN's international control system on nuclear weapons [p. 224]" (asterics added).  But this claim is not analagous to "fanning the flames of chaos," which implies contributing to a condition through one's actions, rather than one's inactions.  It is more appropriate to say that the U.N., by "not adquately dealing" with these situations, is simply neglecting to stamp out the fire. Yet Gold is content to let his highly inflammatory accusations stand, as though the U.N. were helping Iraq to hide its weapons programs or were passing out machetes to the Rwandan Hutus.   If his thesis were merely that the U.N. fails to stamp out the flames of chaos, he would receive little serious argument.  He would, however, have to account for his analysis of why the U.N. is ineffective.  Gold's explanation of why the U.N is ineffective is that anti-democratic nations have come to dominate the body as its membership has expanded over the past half-century.  However this theory does not square with the examples he cites to prove the U.N.'s impotence.  For example, he mentions the failure of the U.N. to mobilize peacekeepers in Rwanda in 1994, and the utter impotence of U.N. "observers" who did nothing to stop the slaughter of Bosnian teenagers at Srebrenica in 1995.  Gold is correct that the U.N. was quite ineffective in both situations, but he does not give the true reason why:  the U.N. was acting within the constraints laid down by the Western states that Gold claims are so powerless and outnumbered in today's U.N..  In the case of Rwanda, the United States refused to acknowledge that genocide was even taking place.  In the case of Srebrenica, the UN "peacekeepers" sat idlely by because the Security Council -- dominated by Western nations (the "perm five") -- permitted the use force only to protect the humanitarian convoys whose presence the West was using as an excuse not to intervene militarily.  In both cases, assigning blame to the U.N., while only occasionally and sporadically hinting at the policies of individual Western nations, paints a highly inaccurate picture of the U.N.'s failures.  In these two cases, the inaction of the U.N. at mobilizing blue helmets reflected the wishes of wealthy Western states of the Security Council, not the Pakistans or the Irans of the U.N. General Assembly.  In other words, the West was handicapping the U.N., not the other way around as Gold tries to convince his readers with selective interpretations of history.  How ironic that in making his case against the U.N., Gold mentions historical examples that disconfirm his own thesis, and show why the U.N. has truly come close to irrelevance.  Gold also expends a great deal of intellectual effort into implicating the UN by association. Because officials of the U.N. like Kofi Annon have routinely met with leaders like Mugabe or Castro, readers are to believe that the U.N. is responsible for granting legitimacy to them and, thus propping up their "terroristic" and despotic regimes. Though interacting with leaders does grant them legitimacy, sometimes it is the only viable option.  Western leaders routinely meet with the heads of authoritarian regimes in the interests of peace and stability. What is worse, they often do so for sheer personal political or economic gain.  Gold is strangely silent on the fact that Rumsfeld was shaking hands with the Butcher of Baghdad as he was gassing Kurdish villages with chemical we sold him.  He also neglects to mention that Arch-conservative Richard Nixon visited Mao Tse Dong in 1972. Japan and South Korea, long-time American allies, conduct talks with Kim Jong-Il, charter member of the axis of evil, not because they support his regime, but because they understand that ignoring it is not a realistic option. One wonders why Dore Gold would be annoyed at the UN's disproportionate fixation with Israel's behavior, when he disproportionately criticizes UN diplomats for meeting the very same disreputable figures that Western nations have talked to for years.   This critique ultimately falters because it presupposes a balance of power in the U.N. that does not correspond to the body's structure.  The United Nations is a Western contrivance, depending on and thus controlled by Western regimes.  Nothing can get done without the unanimous approval of the U.K., France, the U.S.A, and Russia (as Gold very well knows, having watched in person many U.S. vetoes of Security Council resolutions condemning Israel).  Gold's constant allusions to obscure details regarding the U.N.'s minimal and loose associations with terrorist groups and authoritarian governments misses this big picture -- the bigger picture which is capable of producing the truly important lessons.  About the only thing that one can take away from this book is that Gold hates the U.N.  One easily realizes this from reading the title of the book, however, and need not even pay twenty dollars.  Of course the U.N. is not the panacea for all of the world's political ills, but this book does not even come within shouting distance of the many, far more complex reasons why. 
   Iknow that sets like this aren't going to look great, but this set is so bad that in some scenes you see nothing and sound drop out will drive you crazy 
 The oven came out of the box DEFECTIVE -- it did not heat at all!  The rotisserie turned, the lights came on, but NO HEAT at all!  I removed the chicken and tried plain 'ol baking -- NO HEAT.  Now I have to drag the darn thing back to the store!   No more Hamilton Beach products for me!  If Hamilton Beach's "quality control" does not detect such a major problem, how can they detect smaller ones?  
 I am not a supporter of the Black Panthers, in fact I oppose them. Hugh Pearson does more than promote the Panthers in his hollow tell-all book by showing the public how lied about the Panthers are. Much of his sources are misinterpreted, as others have said, and he often seeks the worst outlook as a way of conveying the situation, never giving to even a modest viewpoint. He takes several sources that can be interpreted as unreliable, and then makes it worse by distorting the information therein. His book is as reliable as the history book you used in high school. It has so little of a reliable basis that one should only use it with the utmost scrutiny 
 i'm not sure that all the information provided in this book is truth. i will say that i believe some is inaccurate, and limited. hopefully you have better luck with it. i have noticed a rising popularity in shamanism and i hope there are better books out there than this one, regarding said subject. check out anything by thomas cleary for a great read. also i recommend tao te ching, the urantia book, and melchizidek truth principles. 
 The commericial for this doll shows her swimming in water.  Now I wasn't crazy enough to believe that it could actually swim, but I did think the doll could be placed in water.  NOT!!111  My daughter was very disappointed that she couldn't play with it in the bath tub.  Also the dolls singing is annoying, you can't understand what she's saying 
 Alright, "9pm(Till I Come)" Was Pretty Good When It Was First Released, But Thats About All ATB Has Goin For Him. This Entire Album Is All Based Around That Annoying Little Twangy Guitar Sample Heard In....Well, All His Songs On This Album.  What An Insult To True Fans Of Trance & Electronic Music.  ATB Along With DJ Sammy, Darude, Lasgo, Ian Van Dahl, Alice Deejay ETC, ETC Made Trance A Dirty Word And For That Any True Fan Of Trance Should Boycott All These Fake Artists Music, And Welcome True Trance Talent Paul Van Dyk, Matt Darey, Tiesto, Cristopher Lawrence, and Others Back For Some Real, True, & Intelligent Music, Burn This Album!!! 
 I'm a sicko of a Yes fan. I own all their albums on vinyl, bought them again on cassette in the 80s, and bought them again on CD in the 90s. But I've got to draw the line somewhere.  How many freakin times can a band re-release the same "greatest hits" with a different cover? When I was notified by Amazon of a new Yes album, I jumped all over it thinking, "the boys are back for the first time in 7 years!" But no, it's more like "the boys have released their 7th greatest hits CD in 7 years."  PLEASE DON'T ENCOURAGE THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR! Don't buy this album or it'll just make them do it again, and again, and again. If we all boycott future Yes greatest hits albums, then maybe they'll be forced to actually WORK for their money. I think we'd all enjoy that for a change. WHO'S WITH ME? 
 "A masterpiece!" Maybe..For me, this is kind of film that makes me eternally boring mainly because it is so serious and so heavy. A good try for a film student with visual and musical sensitivity, but felt like a sociological treatise. Failed as a story.  
 Knights, Castles, Medieval Life: Boring. I love Eyewitness books and I like a lot of the Water Eyewitness books, but Eyewitness books like Knights, Castles and Medieval Life just don't appeal to me. Eyewitness  Medieval Life gets 1 star because in about 1 or 2 places in the book it is  kind of intresting but other then that this book is very plain and boring 
 I have three bathrooms used by two teenagers and their friends, a toddler and her friends and so they need heavy duty cleaning every week. A neighbour suggested the Mr Clean to me saying it really cut down on her cleaning time and she didn't have to wreck her back scrubbing the tub.  I am disappointed with it. The one thing I did like was the pole. I was able to scrub the tub, the tile on the walls without needing to overreach. That said, I really had to scrub hard to get the grime off the tub, and still couldn't get it all until I used my regular scrub brush. I think I was expecting this to be a way that I could do a lighter clean in between the heavy duty ones but obviously not so. The other thing that bothered me was that you have to RINSE off the stuff after you scrub; from watching the commercial I feel misled because you get the impression that you just scrub and you're done. At least it wasn't that spendy so I don't feel too bad about the wasted money 
 Although this book is but 15 chapters and 336 pages long it took me an incredible amount of time to read through it due to the complexity with which it was written.  I've read several Cisco Press books in the same time it took to read this one!  Further, I found myself asking the question over and over again, "If this book is about the fundamentals of Voice over IP and is 'A Systematic Approach to Understanding the Basics of Voice over IP', why is it difficult to grasp even the 'basics' as presented by the authors?"  As stated in a previous review, the authors have a great understanding of the topics, however, like my Theory of Operating Systems instructor, they do not do well in 'dumbing' down that information to me, a layperson in this field.  This book was definitely written by VoIP engineers for VoIP engineers, not for beginners like myself 
 This book is an ecumenical sermon about the global implications of hyper-consumerism. It contains little information about specific ways to reduce consumption, leaving it open to the readers to discover techniques that work for them. Instead, it focuses on the ethical philosophy of consuming only what you need.  But are the foundations of this philosophy firm? The author seems to use guilt as a motivating factor for getting Westerners to cut their consumption. He repeatedly states that individuals in the West should reduce their consumption habits, suggesting implicitly that high consumption in the West is depriving the developing world of money or other resources. Paradoxically, reducing consumption in the West would deny wages to the Third World workers who produce consumer products for Western markets. So reducing Western consumption as a means to make the world a better place implies a very simplistic view of economics. Besides that, Western hyper-consumerism pales in the face of that displayed by affluent Easterners or South Asians. A more defensible reason for reducing consumption would be because it simply makes you feel better on a personal level. Also, it's beneficial for family budgets when money isn't spent before it's earned. And that leads to healthier family relationships. A book that focused its arguments on such issues would be far more convincing than this one.  
 ...but no better, either. Whatever charm their earnestness and pop sensibilities might otherwise possess is thwarted at every turn by a mediocre vocalist, and a truly awful drummer. While that combination of sincerity and amateurishness may have worked once upon a time for bands like The Stooges and the Velvet Underground, it ain't 1970 any more. If you really have the urge to hear this style of music, check out the nearest 16-year old's local garage band rehearsal, and save yourself the price of the CD 
 ITS GREAT IF YOU HAVE EVERY OTHER CALPHALON LINE ITEM.  BUT DON'T BE FOOLED WHEN THEY MENTION STAINLESS STEAL,  IT DOES NOT, AGAIN DOES NOT FIT THE TRI-PLY STAINLESS STEAL 8QT. STOCKPOT AS IT INDICATED!(... 
 A disappointing book about a fabulous story.  The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched.  There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as "Steve" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story.  And what a fantastic story that is.  I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it.    One thing is certain: "iCon" sure ain't it. 
 I opened this mixer and it was broken.  I shipped it back.  I did however order another and it was in great condition 
 You can almost see MMM trying to bring out the characters, to shed some sort of three-dimensional light on them, as well as giving some meaning to their interactions. There are too many characters, however, and past the 200th page you kind of stop caring whether Jack wants to live up to his fathers expectations, or that Elizabeth is torn up inside about her feelings. Fiona keeps making stupid decisions and having sex with every TOm Dick and Harry that knocks on her door. Not to mention the fact she keeps associating herself with Patrick, after what he's done to her. She acts like a battered woman, but meanwhile she's supposed to be some sort of strong, outspoken diva. Perhaps it shows up her different faucets, but afer the fifth time she hangs up on Patrick and the thrid time she gets caught trying to get in some guy's pants, it gets kind of annoying. This could have been a very insightful book, instead, it reads like a soap opera. I hate soap operas 
 This is by far the worst detector I have ever had.  Does not detect even close signals.  Had it in for repair twice, still does not work properly.  Gives great false signals and makes a fine [although expensive]door stop 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
 Although I finished reading this book I did so imagining that at some point there would be a real narrative of experiences by those who lived it, i.e. a story of what happened. Instead it is like an assembly of facts and names and dates all of which I began to ignore. Without the story of what happened what difference do the dates, names, etc. make to anyone? Very disappointing read. 
 I am an enrolled Northern Arapaho. The first problem I have is the title. Since when did "Indian Giver" have a positive connotation? Secondly, I find it difficult to validate Mr. Weatherford's "research" since Mt. St. Helens erupted in 1980, NOT 1983. Finally, to me anyway, the book is complete with "facts", unfounded assumptions, and "back-handed" compliments. If the book was intended to "inform" the dominant society of the contributions of Indian people, both from North and South America, then it succeeds. It tells them exactly what they want to hear. It however only irritates the Native populations by providing even more false information to an already poorly informed general public. Ha hou'(Thank you. 
 Jive Bunny and Hooked-on-Classics with failed page-3 slappers pretending to play string instruments.  Conservative, anti-intellectual and reactionary music for conservative, anti-intellectual and reactionary times. A dumb, dumbed-down and blatantly mercenary CD. Musical "mumbo-jumbo" for people who can't listen to any music without drums & percussion and a basic 4.4 beat drummed into their tiny minds.  Classical music doesn't need this sort of rubbish. Pop music has better things to do.    Don't believe the hype 
 I received this book as a gift but it turned out to be a rather cruel one.  I am cynical about the birthing process and medical community and all that so I figured I could stomach some good cynicism, but this book was written with 100% negativity and when I finally got to the part where she describes her caesarean, I put the book down and stopped reading because reading this book to this point made my pregnancy even harder.  Whereas before I was a little nervous about giving birth, I am now absolutely terrified and that's just not healthy.  This author has nothing positive to say about pregnancy, the medical community, or giving birth.  I find the whole book a contradiction -- she specifically discusses how positive thinking and bonding with the baby in utero is important to a healthy pregnancy and then she writes a book about the most terrifying and negative things about it.  How is it healthy to read this?  While I have to concede she makes some interesting points, particularly in her section on fertility, I would never let somebody I cared about read this while, or before becoming, pregnant and I strongly recommend against it.  
 I don't understand the purpose of this book. The six authors all had their story told in Black Hawk Down already. These stories sound like the boring extended scene versions, whereas Bowden only used the highlights of their actions to better convey the intensity of what happened.   Only one author, Dan Schilling, rose above the cliches and bland writing of the others to write a great story. Interestingly, his chapter is the last one in the book as if the editor knew to save the best for last. His story is the only one with depth and feeling.  I respect these guys as soldiers, but as authors they have a long way to go 
 OK - I went into this book hoping it would be a James Michener-type epic with sweeping characters and a grand sense of the rich field of Middle Eastern history since World War II. What I got was a romance novel about 3 men's boring love lifes and their boring affairs with a little war thrown in for spice.   The book starts out well but becomes hopelessly sappy. In addition, I was irritated that the story was told exclusively from the Israeli point of view (undoubtedly since I was hoping for the more-inclusive Michener-type approach). I stopped reading about halfway through.  My grade: F 
 I like funny rappers who have some talent at least. I do not think that his songs or the man is funny at all. And even the people that I know that enjoyed this the first couple times say that they don't like it at all by the third time. Truly bad pointless music that makes all rap music seem like a joke. Avoid this one 
 Skip this one.  It's horrible.  I bought it just before a long flight and didn't have anything else to read.  "I chose poorly."  What kind of author involves his political views and disdain for Christianity in a book called Big Weather?  Well, Mark Svenvold does.  For your money, you get a big dose of Svenvold's personal philosophies packaged with a backdrop of high brow cultural references.  Who is this guy?  And, why should we listen to his rambling pontifications?  I thought I was buying a book about Big Weather!!  Svenvold is also extremely insulting.  He describes one fellow he met as having a receding hairline comparing it to a glacier retreating.  Come now!  Was that necessary?  Oklahomans in particular get an extra helping of insults.  Svenvold lets loose with unflattering comments about a number of individuals.  Most of them were just answering his questions about weather.  Here is a small dose.  Svenvold describes a college student storm chaser: "She had an oval face, a smallish mouth, and large, wide cheekbones that made her look as if she were peering shyly and a little fiercely out from behind a tribal mask, if such a mask wore mascara."  It gets worse.  That is just one I turned to quickly.  Save your money.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.  I have no idea how it managed the ratings is has received.  Still tempted?  Pick it up in a bookstore and read pages 232-237 (soft cover).  If that strikes you as an exciting read about "big weather" then go for it.  This book is for you 
  Fans of Anne McCaffrey's Pern series will want to give a pass this attempt by her son to repeat her success. It is a lackluster telling of what could have been an excellent tale. Todd McCaffrey has none of his mother's talent for involving the reader in the tale or character development. The characters lack depth and the story line jumps and jerks rather than gliding from chapter to chapter 
 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 This book is less a scholarly review of the ancient mystery cults than it is a "Cliff's Notes" rehash of out-of-date ideas and rampant bias.  The only redeeming factor of the entire work are the photographs that accompany each "chapter" (in actuality, each "chapter" is a brief introduction and then 10-15 pp. of photos).  If you're looking for an introductory monograph on mystery cults, see Walter Burkert's _Ancient Mystery Cults_ instead. Don't bother on this 
 I looked forward to the first episode of "Deadwood," hoping HBO would reinvent the Western they way they had reinvented the mob movies with "The Sopranos."  About ten or fifteen minutes in, I finally told myself that if one more person used a particular profanity--it starts with a C and ends with sucker--I was going to turn it off.  I didn't get that thought out before I heard it again.  So I shut it off.  I hear enough profanity in my daily life and I get plenty from movies and TV. Too much, way too much 
 It was very disappointing to see major actors, cinematographers, and editors doing a good job with decidedly sub-rate material. The film looks much, much better than its story. One begins to have doubts when this family of "geniuses" reveal little intellectual heft in conversation and interaction. The Paltrow character is a virtual cipher whose only talent seems to be finding stashes for her cigarettes, despite her promotion as a "prodigy". The purported love triangle has no apparent basis, in other words, the audience is told to accept the premise without evidence. The problem is that this film was written by people who are not professional, creative writers. Characters must be shown to be "interesting", "conflicted", "in-love", "suicidal", etc. by their words and actions, not simply because we are told they are. This can only be accomplished by subtle and clever writing, which is wholly absent here 
 I first encountered "Sr. Issues" by way of "Wisdom Distilled from the Daily," a fine read on St. Benedict if you could get past the occasional barbs against the church vis a vie "womans roles." With this latest work, Sr. Issues revisits and expands on this and other topics.  In short, Traditional Catholics would be well served to ignore Sr. Joan, there are so many fine Catholic authors ones' money and time is too precious to waste on a schismatic. For those who seek "reform" in the name of destroying the true faith, "Kerry" Catholics, or quasi-Episcopalians, then Sr. Joan is right up your alley 
 I read it. I finished it. I put it down and didn't speak of it again. Not my style: Too much floof - not enough substance. However, if this is your thing, it's not poorly written 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Bukowski fan. Post Office is a great novel and Women is pretty damn good also, but this is just awful. If this was his first ever novel, it would never have been published. Bukowski always writes about how he never got anything into print for 25 years and if it was anything like this then I can believe why. Pulp, is just a very bad book. The story is stupid, the plot is a mess, the characters are dumb. The only good thing about it is it's short. It's a shame to read something so bad from someone I used to love to read. Stay well away from this book, you will only be very disappointed 
 Seems like i am in a minority. Book stinks, shallow and desperate. A pseudo scholar..  one of many..  what a shame 
 If you've read (or are reading) "Start Late, Finish Rich" or any of Bach's other books on personal finance, remember your Latte Factor and avoid buying this workbook.  Everything you need to know is in his books.  You can figure everything out with your own paper and pencil.    If you're planning to buy "Start Late, Finish Rich," please read my review of it first and save yourself a lot of grief 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 Enthousiastic customer reviews made my choice of this book a no-brainer. Working for a major international news agency as a financial correspondent, I looked for some fresh methods, angles and ideas to incorporate in my  interviews and market wrap-ups from the equity and corporate world. But  reading through this (highly-praised) feature-writing guide I was  disappointed to see that the material is very boring, outdated and  repetitive of the examples used. The book may give some guidance for  one-story-a-month, relaxed writers. But it looks out of touch with the  modern world of editors demanding fairly speedy 'spot coverage' of events,  where the newsbreaks and the accompanying stories are written on laptop  computers and sent by e-mail 
 Don't be misled.  Because Thomas Berry is promoted as a Catholic priest, many people are falsely led to believe that his books present Catholic or Christian teaching about the environment.  Instead, this book presents a New Age blend of do-it-yourself religion mixed with pseudo-science.  If you're into that, you'll probably like this book.. 
 I was hoping for a story (my baby is named Zoe) but instead it is another standard Alphabet book only featuring children with names that try way too hard to be diverse.  Maybe my baby will grow into the illustrations, but right now she is confused by them 
 Don't be fooled by the title of this cookbook.  First, it is filled with exotic and gourmet, not to mention expensive, recipies.  The choice of ingredients might be fine if you live in New York or San Francisco, but here in northern Wisconsin many ingredients just aren't available.  (And if they were, would you fix squab or fried rabbit for Tuesday night dinner for your family?)  A second disappointment is the copious use of butter, oil and heavy cream.  This is the first time I've ever been so disappointed in a book I ordered that I will be returning it 
 As a Construction Superintendent I previously used the sixth edition and was looking forward to the new 10th Edition. What a disapointment. Much of the useful text has been replaced with useless dimensions for every type of furniture imaginable. Many chapters have been stripped down to brief over views, and turned into "that's what this is called" details.   If that's the type of book your looking for there are many other less expensive options out there.   If you need serious details, try some of the previous editions since the means and methods of construction don't change significantly. You may find some of the newer materials aren't included in previous editions, however, what good is it to you if the 10th Edition only shows you a cross section of the material 
 this book doesnt contain the amount of information that you might expect.If you have no idea about apreggios then you will learn somthing from it however if you already have a basic knowledge of arpeggios this book wont be very helpful.it does howveer have a few nice superimposing ideas but nothing spectacular.overall i was dissapointed with the book and could of obtained the information from the web . chord arpeggio shapes arnt hard to come across.the book includes a cd but there are no backing tracks to practice your arpeggios 
 This was undoubtedly a propaganda film, but if one remembers when it was made and makes the necessary allowances, it's not bad a bad movie.  And it's not totally agitprop.  There is no doubt, for e.g., that Americans who  participated in the Doolittle raid and were subsequently captured alive by  the Japanese were brutally murdered.  But  some of the incidents allegedly  taking place are unnecessarily absurd.  For instance, the announcement that  Corregidor had fallen resulted in Japanese officers in the courtroom  slashing at each other with swords like a bunch of pre-pubescent children,  and an American boxer actually defeated a judo expert -- sheer nonsense.   	 The movie centers on the concept that the Japanese didn't know where the  B-25's came from, and the Americans' steady refusal to tell them.  In  actuality, the Japanese were well aware of the approaching task force and  its makeup... 	One has to realize, while watching, that this movie was  made when the mood in the country was gloomy.  Japan had staged a wide  blitz in the Pacific and had smashed easily through all opposition.  We  were frightened.  If you keep that in mind, and can make allowances for the  obvious misinformation, the performances are good and the movie fun to  watch 
 What a complete and utter waste of time.  Its obvious how these guys got dubbed the nutroots 
 1. Expensive. 2. Fatally flawed (as of January 2007)  The sharpener system works well for my knives BUT the method of attaching the rotating handle to the base is fatally flawed.  Both sharpeners I received had to be returned after 1-2 uses because the handle separated from the base holding the fingers.  If Furi redesigns the base and handle I'd buy another one 
 I bought this book excited by the premise and found it to be a sad disappointment. Populated with gross stereotypes, misrepresentative of the Faith, and full of poorly-constructed two-dimensional characters made colorful by circumstance rather than spirit, Rinaldi takes a beautiful piece of Church Lore and turns it into a relativistic anti-Catholic romp. Propaganda at its worst.  Irredeemably convoluted if not downright hateful 
 I was at first rather impressed by the epic size of the book thinking it must contain something new about the comedian. Well, I was wrong. It was long, tedious and nasty. Granted, Chaplin was not perfect, but the author's preoccupation with his imperfections borders on sickening. A better title for this book would be 'Trash, what I think of Charlie'. Joyce Milton would do well writing for tabloids.. 
 Guess I'm in the minority about this, but this PLAY (NOT a MOVIE) left me thinking that I wasted my money.  I enjoyed Madea, she is a great character.  I never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems. For me the only thing funny about it was when Madea took the stage, the rest of it was simply boring 
 I ordered this book but didn't notice that it was an E-Book. How can they charge the same price for an E-Book? Personally, I think the Acrobat Reader sucks when compared to a real paperback or regular old HTML. Anyway, I figured I'd try to download it since I'd placed the order. WOW, there is Adobe DRM and MS Passport to deal with. Way too much trouble, I just called Amazon and cancelled the order. Maybe the content of the book is OK, I don't know. If I were an author I don't think I'd let them offer my books in PDF form just yet 
 Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Not recommended.  In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, "I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is," ". . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age," and ". . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must." Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.  Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, "A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.  When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as "woman" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the "living," no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.  Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as ". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot," he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.  Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, "If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep." On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren't in "lock step," Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including "the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers"), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.  Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. When a friend says, "A boy can break your heart . . . He's so damned beautiful! And so cruel!" Miller writes, "We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earnest." When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, "At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good."  Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, " . . . they must be saturated with my anguish," the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. He describes artists such as himself as the "inhuman ones." "I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on." Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger.  Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). Shapiro says, "There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America." If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his "art," his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the "greatest" of these souls, may I never meet the least.  Note: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it 
 Someone has to bring the average down.   I have all Cracker's (and CVB's) records and like all of them except this one.  In my opinion these songs are pretentious, non-melodic and self-conscious 
 The author states (p.330) regarding "Darwinism--adaptation brought about by natural selection": "Whether we like it or not, we are stuck with it. The Darwinian revolution is over, and Darwin won."  He goes on to say that any satisfactory response must hence be on Darwinian terms, "adaptation, selection, blind variation..." The last of these, also known as random mutation, is of course how according to Darwin live organisms obtain the form that allows them to survive. As I tried in other reviews here (and am dealing with fully in my own book), I am presently again trying to convey that this focus on the organism's form stems from a misguided analogy between humanly produced functional artifacts and the functionality of organisms. It was argued in defense of intention in the organism's form that just as man-made artifacts are in their functions produced intentionally by an intelligent designer, so must organisms in their functions be the intentional product of intelligence.  And the dispute is well known to be about whether or not organisms, too, were formed intentionally, by way of a goal-directed process.    The mistake is that the goal-directedness or its absence is looked for in the wrong area. While there may be difficulties in showing whether organismic forms came about by plan or by accident, there is no difficulty at all in seeing instead that it is the organism's activities that are indeed goal-directed. For this evidence of preponderant goal-directedness in the living--their aim of self-preservation--which stares us straight in the face, there appears to be a complete blind spot. On recognizing this, the consequence is that Darwinism, contending the same aimlessness in organisms as in other natural events, is false. Yet Darwin is doggedly followed in science and praised to high heaven, with the author of the now reviewed book calling him a genius (p.109). Let me accordingly comment briefly on how original is Darwin's thinking.  Inasmuch as natural selection is in essence the environment's influence on the organism, the influence occurring in any case, the main point of Darwin is that organisms become adapted to the environment by accident rather than by aim. And it is obvious that for any chance of that to happen, supposing it possible at all, there must be enormous multitudes of variations as claimed, the thought requiring no new idea.  The subsequent thinking then has had to be preoccupied with seeking explanations of how the wrongly hypothesized chance adaptations occur. 
 Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I've read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.  I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she's lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed.  This story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view.  There's the rich guy, Charlie, who can't seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.  Then there's rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.  The last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.  The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie's yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.  Danielle Steel should stop writing.  You can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won't even bother renting them from the library.  I won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I'm going to read them 
 I thought this book would be different from the manual that came with the software, but it was exactly the same.   A disappointment 
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 The range of story and poetry selections is so limited, the materials bore students to death. The issues the texts are obsessed with--morbid existential guilt, death of a spouse or a parent ala Joyce, O'Connor, Cather, etc.,--no longer have the spell-binding effect they once had on the adult sensibility. We now live in an age where more dramatic problems occur. There has got to be some good literature that covers issues of our day, such as mass murder, rape, school-shootings, hysteria, incest, money problems, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, religious intolerance, etc. This textbook is totally out of touch with the current realities of our lives in the 21st century. 
 Other reviewers baffle me.    The metaphors are syrupy, the advice either obvious or suspect, and everything a dash too cute.  Anecdotes bore, ramble, though some of the quotes are interesting.  What use the technical advice may have had is probably gone with time, and what remains handy is rather obvious.    Some of the discussion on particular pieces may be useful for those actually playing them at present; I'm not, but even if I were, I'm not sure I could stomach the prose again.  I love the piano, too, truly, and it's always nice to share thoughts with someone with similar feelings, but Cooke's fondness for the instrument verges on the pedophilic 
 As a professional my self I do not advice to buy this book, the reason is simple: People who are involved in mixed paellas (meats & seafood) do not understand the true soul of this dish. Ask anyone in Valencia what he thinks about mixing shrimp with meats, Its a herecy! I recomend you buy the book "100 Paellas & 1 Fidehuá, this is the closest you will be to the real thing but is in Spanish only. THE MIXED PAELLA WAS CREATED DURING THE TURIST BOOM OF THE MID XX CENTURY IN SPAIN AND IS A PRODUCT FOR IGNORANT TURISTS, no Paella made by a Valencian or any old school coock will have both seafood and meats. GUILLERMO OLAIZ III 
 Seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants.  So now it sits in my car fading in the sun.  Save your money 
 Why do we need another history book about ignorant cowards hiding behind bed sheets? Perhaps include details on the bed sheets thread count 
 I had a Pioneer real-time burner that I used for about 7 years prior to buying this piece of junk.  The Pioneer unit worked fine until it finally gave out.  The Sony deck was initially OK, once I worked my way through an extremely confusing operator's manual.  I succeeded in making several good-quality "needle drop" CD's from older lp sources.  However, after about 90 days, everything went wrong.  I could still make whole CD's and finalize easily, but 4 out of every 5 cd's I made skip when played back in any other player, be that the car, my computer, or at the office.  In short, all the time and money spent have been for naught.  I won't buy any Sony components again. 
 Home made and thoughtless. Interesting only for its defense of the slaughter in Tiananmen square. 
 ....since she makes him look like the worst man alive. Anecdotes about how she has to beg him to do his part as a father and how he negatively reacts to her pregnancies really set my teeth on edge. Am I the only woman alive whose husband truly cherishes his role as a father? Even worse, I put 2 and 2 together and realized the man in question is none other then THE Jimmy Iovine, famous producer. Is THAT how she was able to get this drivel published? I agree with the previous reviewer who noted the overabundance of run on sentences as well. Don't waste your money on this book:The Iovines have plenty as it is. 
 Of course it works great - for as long as it works. After some time, my unit develped a leak. Unlike better showerheads, the part connecting the head to the hose is assembled in two pieces that separate after time, causing the seals to not set properly, resulting in the kind of leak mine developed. Unless you want to replace your showerhead every couple of years, I'd stay away fom this model. And good luck navigating Watrepik's website to get any help 
 This study guide is rife with errors. Even if someone were to give you the book at no cost, you should still not read it. It does more harm than good 
   It should be named "how to writing SQL for MS Access, Oracle 7i and xxx" since that is all about. It is weird to me why "Design" is in the title. There is absolutely nothing covered on what is inside a RMDB, man 
 This would have to be the worst book I have ever read.Wow Will is running from dead people. Some one is trying to kill him so cool.How much more boring can you get.I would not recommend this book to a cave man or any thing for that mater. So what I'm saying is it stinks 
 Well, let's put it this way ...  I bought this when the vinyl was first released.  Went with all the other APP albums I had.  My 700 or so vinyl discs have since been entrusted to an old friend.    I've since purchased *almost* all the APP CDs that I once had on vinyl.  Not this one.    For me, Pyramid was the pinnacle -- 5 stars.  Love the rest of the first four, as well as Stereotomy and Gaudi -- 4 stars.  I'd give 3 stars to Vulture Culture and Eye in the Sky.  But this one and Eve just didn't do it for me.  On a tangentially related note ... if you haven't heard Godley & Creme's Goodbye Blue Sky, try to find yourself a copy.  A rollicking good time 
 This book is an attempt to describe the emotional process of selling by evaluating the motivating factors which affect your selling abilities.  However, it is a combination of every sales program you have ever had, along with a self-help book from the 70's. Ron Willingham is really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one, and it is really disappointing coming from a man who I have held in such high esteem before reading this book. The idea that all sales people's capabilities are driven by their unconscious belief system - the "Area of the Possible," is simply horse-hockey.  The material is dated psycho-analysis applied to a sales program, which is not well written or thought-out.  The logical fallacies of the arguments used to "Prove" the program works are laughable.  Do yourself a favor and don't drink the Kool-aid.  Pass this one by!!!!  
 In a sense, it's sort of silly to try and write anything useful about a book so completely hyped by critics and carefully studied (cf. New Essays on Call it Sleep), but I'm going to anyway, because I didn't like it. Now, to be totally up front, I read it under a certain amount of duress. My book group picked it, and after the first ten pages I decided I wasn't going to read it and would miss the discussion for the first time in four years. However, it happened that at the exact same time, I started a research project in which I needed to learn about Manhattan in 1916. Since that's just a year or so after when this novel is set, I realized I could kill two birds with one stone -- and so I went ahead and read it.  In hindsight, I realize that I should have skipped the introduction by Alfred Kazin which appears in my edition. It gives away almost every significant plot point and plants far too much in the reader's head -- I cannot conceive of why it wasn't the afterword. Plussing as which, it's not a great essay, even a light skim of it will reveal at least one logical flaw and a total misreading of a scene from the book. So, skip the introduction until after you've read the story. And that story is basically the heavily autobiographical inner life of a emotionally damaged 8-year-old Jewish kid in a rapidly modernizing New York. Many like to laud this book as the best novel about the immigrant experience ever written. This seems rather a strange proposition, for while one of the central themes is certainly the boy's attempt to discover an identity in this brave new world, his circumstance is far from typical. First of all, the Jewish immigrant experience in New York is a very particular one, especially as it relates to cultural persecution in the old world and the notion of alienation and always being "the other". Trying to say the "New York Jewish immigrant experience" is representative of the "immigrant experience" in general is clearly ridiculous. Secondly, by their own choices and actions, the boy's family is almost completely cut off from their fellow immigrants, and are hardly representative. Indeed, it's almost refreshing to find a depiction of immigrants whose hardships are largely of their own making.   The boy protagonist is a particularly irksome guide to this world, as he is the ultimate mama's boy (although not without reason). One of the running menacing subplots is the question of whether or not his father is truly his biological father or not, and what exactly his mother got up to in the old country that led to her being married off to a brute of a man (elements apparently drawn from Roth's own childhood). The bulk of the book concerns the boy's horrendous struggle both to assimilate into the world around him and to decipher the spiritual world. The former is a reasonably well-told and familiar portrait of an outsider who just doesn't "get it". The latter fills the book with religious symbolism, which remained largely a mystery to me owing to my utter lack of religious education and knowledge. Clearly, readers with a strong understanding of Judaism and Christianity will certainly find plenty to chew on. The sexual realm is another running theme, and one that's treated with a great deal of angst, confusion, and negativity. This takes on an entirely different aspect if you read the book knowing that Roth, as his biographer so gently puts it, "indulged in incest" with his sister Rose (and a cousin) for several years during his early teen years. A less sugar-coated way of putting it is that he sexually abused and raped his little sister for several years... This is hardly incidental to the book, as his biographer writes: "Roth would ultimately recognize that incest was the engine that drove his composition." Roth's tortured soul comes through very clearly in his younger alter ego, and it's not a pretty sight.   The style and language used are certainly distinctive, and doubtless many find it invigorating and affecting -- I did not. Roth was rather famously influenced by Joyce, Eliot, and other modernists, and I just happen not to care for modernism. The stream of consciousness employed to depict the boy's inner terrors is effective in moderation, but each passage of it runs on far too long, almost to the point of parody. Similarly, much has been written about Roth's representation of Yiddish and the phonetic treatment of English in the book, but neither has aged particularly well. The stylistic flourishes, epithets, and distinctive syntax of Yiddish which Roth employs are difficult to read without simultaneously "hearing" them as farce or parody of the Mel Brooks variety. There are a great deal of detailed descriptive passages, which again, may appeal to those who appreciate the writer as still-life artist, but again, these struck no chord with me.  So, I freely admit that many of my reasons for not liking the book are personal, however I doubt I am alone in this (as indeed I wasn't in my book group). It simply did not resonate with me on any level, and I can't say I'm the richer for having read it. Others certainly will be though, especially those with an interest in Jewish-American literature or literature about New York 
 I have never read one of Johansen's books and after reading this one, I'm not likely to read another.  I usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means, but I just couldn't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing.  Exclamations such as "dear heaven" and "lord" were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book, which doesn't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone (it would suit my southern grandma, however).  As another reviewer said, the big mystery of why Daisy wouldn't leave Geneva wasn't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him.  Character development was lacking and I just didn't care that much about them.  I would have liked to hear more about Cynthia and her antics.  I did finish the book because I was curious to know what happened, but I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Sorry, but this was not my cup of tea 
 I bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping, since I tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet. I was in for a big disappointment.  For the price that I paid compare to the other yoga mats, I was very disappointed.  Lesson learned, find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on-line.  For those of you who sweats alot, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS MAT.    
 I don't care what MPI says about these being unedited episodes.  They have clearly been edited.  Why else would every single episode run exactly 24 minutes?  That's not just a coincidence.  Back in the early 1970s situation comedies were always slightly over 25 minutes in length.  A full minute has been cut from the Doris Day show.  Very disappointing 
 I bought several versions of the Bundle Me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit! I am so frustrated by this! Why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe??? We took our car seat to the Katie Cares Safety Check today and they took all of the accessories off. We had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe. Save your money and buy a version that goes OVER the seat and baby, not under... Kidopotomus makes one. 
 This adapter vignettes badly at wide-angle settings on my A700, so much so  that the field of view for which there is no vignetting is essentially identical to that without the adapter at the widest setting of the regular lens. Thus absolutely nothing has been gained by using the adapter. Canon, normally a responsible firm with many excellent products, is beneath contempt in marketing this lens.  I called Canon customer service and spoke with a sympathetic representative who took the matter up with "someone else".  The outcome was that they admit that there "is very little increase" in the non-vignetted field of view by using this adapter.  She said she would put my comments on a company-internal problem compilation called "customer voice".  I can only hope it reaches someone high enough to do some good 
 Tinny and hard to digest, the lone worthy track , ( I'm Getting ) Closer to my Home, is cool enough for me to give it 2 stars. It's a dreamy song with special sounds like water splashing. If it wasn't so hollow, and the production values better, it would probably be a song still heard on radio and TV. Otherwise, not much else here 
 I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice 
 Never recieved my purchase after one month 
 As a reference to research the communist block nations' weapon of choice, I advice to look at other publications. This needs more picts instead of leaving it to readers to use their imagination on what a particular model of AK must look like if author simply says "...similar in appearance to..."  However, the history of how it was developed was well covered 
 As a software developer I found most of the information in this book to be something less than earth shattering.  Basically, there are companies that specialize in data mining as much information on us as they can.  The present administration is drooling over the possibility to use this information.  A large percentage of the information stored in the databases is in error.  That's pretty much the book.  Should we be concerned?  Yes, but not of the information existing because its mostly public information anyway that is being linked in creativie ways.  I'm not an advocate for this by any means but I'm not terribly fearful of it either.  What does concern me, and should you, is how much of the information is wrong and how difficult it is to get these companies to fix it.  To me, that was the greatest point the book made.  As for government spying.  We know now that the government is surveying us in much greater and more Orwellian ways than we would have thought possible.  Unfortunately, this is what I wanted to learn more about and is pretty much missing from the book.  Also, there is no "solution" provided.  How can we protect ourselves?    Mainly, I was disapointed be because every person mentioned in the book has a drawn out biography provided about them.  I really didn't care how the CEO of a data mining company grew up.  I wanted to learn about the subject of the book, not history of indivuals.  Its not a bad book, but I grew tired of the biographies and the content didn't surprise me or frighten me enough to be real impressed 
 Don't waste your time with this dreck. go get Dan Zevin's "The Day I Turned Uncool: Confessions of a Reluctant Grown-up.&quot 
 This whole thing is pathetic.  And, yes, I read this AFTER the hoax was uncovered.  The funny thing is, I so wanted to be amazed by the writing.  I wanted for all the naysayers to be proven wrong, but instead I just found myself trudging through a pretty uninspired and mindnumbingly dumb novel.    As for the writer, I really don't care who she is because the writing alone speaks for the vapidness at play here; although I find the lengths she went to just to discredit other writers--or claiming people like Stephen Beachy as being liars when, in fact, they were reaching for the truth--to simply underscore the grifter behind the prose.  I mean, come on, the JT Leroy web site has a fairly outraged diary entry from the author that speaks of the lies and deception at play from our current government (and this was right before the hoax was exposed).  I think by denying ones own hand at large-scale deception while milking the current failings of the political landscape pretty much shows the self-centeredness and lack of integrity this author has.  Anyway, like all con jobs, I'm sure she'll milk what is left out of this gag and move on to another scheme to keep herself in the limelight 
 I read this to supplement my studies in Christianity. What I found was the same ole same ole. Women are seen as little more than slaves, God keeps telling "his choosen" to kill those of other faiths, the sun revolves around the earth, etc..etc.. But don't take my word for it. Read it yourself 
 except blunt james compact release withexplicit lyrics means we are unable to sing so we tryto make money with offence&vulgarit 
 I honestly admit I did not finish this book.  The topics jump from one to the next with no focus. The author reminded me of my worst profs in college; a self proclaimed genius with NO ability to write or communicate.  
 The title IS very deceptive. I bought the book thinking it was going to help me see life diffrently, it didnt. The author seems to be using the word "God" to get the attention of a christian audience and thats about all. Relates  "god winks" to divorce, and walking out of a marriage. Last time I checked God wasnt a proponet of those things. The author uses these as examples to reprsent a change in life that God is promoting.. The book does have u think about conicidences a little more, and might have u think more deeply into them, but thats about all. I would NOT reccomend this book to a new christian or a struggling christian. It takes all the focus onto the individual and not God. The only thing good about the book is that it is a quick read, and offers interesting stories every now and then. Beware..dont be fooled 
 I bought this book a few weeks ago and very unhappy with it when it came.  I was able to flip through the book and read all the information in about 15 minutes total.  There was nothing new in that book that I didnt already know.  And certainly nothing more than I could find for free on [...].  I can see that it may be helpful for someone who knows nothing about wedding planning, but not useful for the average woman.  Instead, save your money and buy a binder with some dividers and head to [...] 
 I was surprised to find this book not only still in print, but enthusiastically reviewed by so many who obviously take it seriously.  For those willing to do a little background research into Casteneda and his subject matter it will quickly become apparent that the events detailed in 'The Teachings' did not, and could not have occurred as described.  Space prevents me going into detail here, but I have a review on my website at:  http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Castanedax.ht 
 I originally read Edith Hamilton's book for a high school literature class. I've loved reading Greco-Roman mythology since childhood. The lives of the major Greco-Roman Gods and Goddesses were better than soap operas to me.   When I began reading Edith Hamilton's book back in high school, I thought I'd enjoy reading this text. Although she conducts an excellent scholarly study of GrecoRoman myths, I didn't care for Edith Hamilton's writing style which starved much of the life, warmth, and beauty out of the original tales. She makes the myths sound like more like a comparative literary study than actual stories. It was a huge disappointment: Hamilton's style made GrecoRoman mythology feel like slow torture.   I still own my original high school copy of Hamilton's Book. Even though I've finished college and am nearing the completion of grad school, my feelings regarding Edith Hamilton's book haven't changed one iota. Even after re-reading the text several times, it still reads as the same bland, boring, pretentious piece of drivel I read as a freshman in high school. I still, however, use her book as a supplemental reference text.  This past week, I decided to pick up and read the alternative to Hamilton's work -- Bulfinch's Mythology: The Age of Fable when I began my private study of mythology after reading Joseph Campbell's "Pathways to Bliss" and "The Hero with a Thousand Faces." So far, I love Bulfinch's work and am enjoying it immensely. Bulfinch manages to infuse GrecoRoman myths with life and he manages to make the characters come alive with his storytelling. Bulfinch even include references to Greco Roman mythology in poetic citations. In addition, he even includes pronunciations of Greek/Roman names. Like Hamilton, he also includes alternative versions of myths in his text, but does it with a slight sense of humor. Bulfinch's book is a huge -- much bigger than Hamilton -- but, it's engrossing, interesting, and lively -- I've barely been able to put it down since starting it. Bulfinch's work has made me want to search for other alternative books as well to continue reading about GrecoRoman mythology.  If you're looking for a short introductory comparative study of GrecoRoman mythology, then Edith Hamilton's work is for you. But, there are better studies out there in my opinion -- and I urge you to look for alternatives. If you want a text that's not dry, boring, and pendantic then it's hard to beat Bulfinch's Mythology's "The Age of Fable." 
 My kids are used to playing games on a computer so the screen was very disappointing.  It is very poor quality, but perhaps that is why it is so inexpensive.  I wish I had taken the advice of some other viewers and gone to a store to see it in person.  I will be trying to sell mine again 
 This book covers most areas of engineering, as advertised.  However, I find it doesn't have enough depth to allow you to solve real world problems in a field of engineering one is familiar with, while at the same time, doesn't give enough background to allow you to make good use of the formulae in fields that you may be new to.  In other words, it is written somewhat obtusely.  That's fine if one just needs a refresher of what one has learned before or elsewhere, but makes it difficult to use in a new area 
 I agree with the last reviewer, the questions in this book are ones that maybe you would ask someone in the first month or so of dating but after that if you have any type of conversation skills you would have already found out the answers to 99% of the questions. Don't waste your money. 
 The music of Dowland is wonderful - but Sting isn't up to interpreting it. You can't even distinguish the words half the time, just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he doesn't possess the skills to carry it off. This music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...Sting, for all his merits, hasn't got that in his repertoire yet.   It's an exercise in pretention, laughable at times. The letter reading is ridiculous. I love both Sting's voice and Dowland's song, but this CD is a failure. 
 this is a very colorful book, full of interesting facts. my 10 yr old grandson, has 3 other ripley books and is alway pulling them out and reading them. if you love the show, you will indeed love these books. they are price just right. c 
 This small book has a load of recommendations on the back cover. Yet, I find it unsatisfactory. It meanders in and out of the history of Islam and the Middle East, but loses focus on the way. Subjects are touch upon by conclusion and generalisation, but not really in depth. It is obvious, however, that Lewis knows quite a lot - but still some clear mistakes (or misformulations?) in chronology and factual events mar the picture, and damages the feeling of trust to how the subjects are handled. It has some really interesting insights in how the USA became the great enemy of the Islamists, and many details that makes the Middle East history much more detailed than it usually appears. Yet, in walking there and there, it lacks the solid foundation on facts and events present in the books of Serge Trifkovic, for example. And while Trifkovic writes with determination and feeling for the importance of facing the Islamist threat, Lewis merely mentions the threat, but then walks on to something else. And he doesn't really connect the issues of Holy War and Unholy Terror in depth as promised in the subtitle.  Bottom line: While interesting, I suggest to spend time and money on better books. They are out there 
 I wish I had liked this CD more, but I'm afraid that overall I found it boring.  I think part of the problem is the decision to show how all the various artists from all over the world shared a common tradition.  I think the CD would probably have interested me more if it had showcased the differences between them rather than the similarities, because after a while it all started to sound alike.  Perhaps orthodoxy extends to music too.  The artists seemed to be following orthodox tempos, orthodox rhythms, orthodox intervals and progressions.  I found all the selections tasteful and subdued.  I've now listened to it four or five times, but I don't think I'm ever going to warm up to it 
 Maybe I am lucky... i have the original, limited edition New Falcon version.. even autographed by Chris Hyatt. I have owned the Llewellyn edition in the past, but disposed of it BECAUSE IT IS GARBAGE... incomplete, garbled... don't even bother with this edition. I believe "The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic" (New Falcon publications) is also still being sold on amazon.com. It is more expensive... but you truly get what you pay for. Don't waste your time on this Llewellyn garbage. I think ZERO stars would be more accurate.. 
 The user interface was horrible. The product documentation was even worse. I still can't figure out how to perform a regular scan, no OCR. This was poorly designed, poorly supported. Get some other scanner, this one is impossible 
 Just received the German 4 disc digipak. GOOD NEWS. played 10 mins of both - no problems. Menus are all in English (or German) all the extra's on the English R2 SE's are here except for the photo gallery.  The sound is very good and the restored english mono is BETTER than the MGM 5.1 also on here with the commentary and German mono. The 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation.  Picture. No problems I could see on my 6ft screen via InFocus 5700 projector from an Arcam FMJ-DV29 DVD player. Player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything.  Only watched first 10mins of each but doing A-B comparisons with the English R2 MGM SE's the German ones are noticeably better, they look less washed out, contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on Fistful, which is why I bought this set, but also on Few Dollars More as well.  They are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly Few Dollars More is at last the full version, which no MGM DVD is worldwide..... 
 This is the most misinformed intolerant religious right wing propaganda I have ever read.  The author obviously took many assumptions about paganism and stereotyped the entire group.  His arguments against it hold as little logic as he claims the pagan community uses in their own beliefs.  I would strongly recommend not purchasing this book of intolerance and social hatred 
 As a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, I can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever. I got this book based on the glowing reviews I found here, and I'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it.  The most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle "An Integrated Approach to Security in the Organization." The book not only lacks effective security integration techniques, it doesn't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration. 
 If one reads this, they might do it with one of those foam collars about their necks that people use for whiplash, because that is precisely how you will feel when you finish this work.  It's not bad enough the writer gets SO many facts wrong, out of order or does about faces on her own statement - it's a marathon of WRONG - she actually and consistently contradicts herself!  One can write a small book on the errors this author carelessly makes.  Take this as TOTAL FICTION and you MIGHT enjoy it.  If you are looking for a feel for the period, look elsewhere.  Save your money - and the headache!  To see a writer do so much research and get it ALL so wrong, jumping around in chronological order with the consistency of a ping pong ball, had to be a fine madness.   I don't think someone could deliberately set out to get something so wrong and do half a thorough job as Murray did 
 This book is not the quality of work that I've come to expect from Janette Oke.  I was very disappointed in it, and quit reading it about half way through.  The characters were lovable and interesting, but I thought the plot dragged just a bit too much for me 
 A quick trip to the Internet will be more useful than this book. It is missing a lot of practical things. Plus, to understand the book, you would already have the rudimentary knowledge it provides. Pass on this one and go to your local home store for help 
 This is a useful book if you are just getting started learning about mandarin squares. However, this slim volume does not go into any depth. The limited pictures of mandarin squares do not give any indication of how the  designs changed over time. The time spent discussing embroidery techniques  do not add much to the understanding of the things that were being  embroidered. I found Ladder to the Clouds much more informative 
 congrats on your first victory in eight and a half decades 
 This was another Pinker book I couldn't finish. If he was a taxi-driver he would take you from Brooklyn to New York via San Francisco. Sometimes even his asides have asides! Perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word 
 By setting her story in Manhattan, among the literary elite, Claire Messud might have imagined she was giving her readers an updated version of Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities," which described upper-class life in Manhattan among the Wall Street elite, so exquisitely that character descriptions from his 1987 book ("master of the universe" and "social skeleton") became part of our vocabulary.   Claire Messud is no Tom Wolfe. "The Emperor's Children" describes a circle of ambitious young adults who alternately worship and plot the overthrow of "The Emperor," a famous writer.  Unlike "Bonfire of the Vanities," this book has no compelling narrative - the "voice" shifts from one character to the next and the story ambles along as these young adults try to figure out what they want, who they need and who they love or hate and why.  Trust me, you won't care.  Meanwhile, the "Emperor" lopes along as a literary lion past his prime.  The characters become entangled in a mess of betrayals (the "Emperor" betrays his wife with his daughter's best friend, the daughter betrays her father by marrying the man who would dethrone the "Emperor" etc. etc.) -- and all the mess just goes away after the attacks on September 11, 2001.  But we never learn how September 11 affected Messud's characters - she uses that fateful day as an excuse to bring the curtain down on this stupid story going nowhere.     
 First off, I love Eddie Murphy.  In my opinion, he's one of the more brilliant talents to come out of SNL.  But it's a crying shame that sketches that were included on the original VHS version of "Eddie Murphy: Best of SNL" have been deleted from the DVD version.  My particular favorite piece (Eddie playing a rastafarian singing "we're gonna kill da white people" at a meeting of mostly white VFW members) is NOT on this DVD along with a number of others.  Have the SNL folks suddenly become squeamish and politically correct - I can only assume that such cowardice and overly correct behavior is at the root of such an obvious ommission.  After having owned the VHS version, I can honestly say that I regret having purchased the DVD.  I would return it if I could.  Listen to the other viewers and don't be fooled 
 This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
 I will give this movie two stars, simply for the two memorable scenes in the movie that make it worth seeing - at least once. The demon coming out of the TV set scene is suprisingly well done, rivaling even what we would see years later in movies like The Ring. The second scene is where the demon kid is chasing a woman around the apartment, then he falls to the ground and an alien demon crawls out of his chest and continues to chase her around the place. There's pastel neon lights flashing in the background, and the whole scene is jam packed with 80's cliches. It's almost like a cross between The Omen, a Billy Idol video, Aliens, and Return of the Living Dead. It's so ridiculously absurd and campy, it makes me crack up every time I see it 
 She doesn't sing... SHE YELLS!!! And using one of Ednita's songs as she did with "Lo que son las cosas" is just sacrilege at its "best" (or worst). It's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself. She has absolutely nothing on Beyonce or Cristina Aguilera. Her cd is just plain bad! If you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices (and that actually SING), you might want to look for La Lupe, Celia Cruz, Ednita Nazario and Lucecita Benitez... and these are only the ones I remembered at the moment 
 $99.99 list price?  Over $70 actual price?  You've got to be kidding!  I never accuse companies of raping consumers, because we are free to choose what we buy and how much we spend, but this smells of taking advantage of consumer ignorance.  If you want to connect your iPod to your home stereo, get a $7.00 "stereo mini-plug to RCA plug Y-adapter" at Radio Shack.  That's all you need.  Because you already have a recharger (it came with your iPod), the only additional capability this kit provides is holding your iPod upright. I have this item (it came free with my 40GB iPod) and, although it offers a slight convenience over not having it, the price is a terrible rip-off.  
 My best friend advised me not to read this book. But, she's a bit of an elitist, so I figured, what the heck? I mean, I like plenty of things she finds annoying or stupid. I was wrong. Here is my honest impression of the book:  First chapter: This isn't so bad.. a bit melodramatic.. but not bad Quarter of the way through the book: He is not going there, is he? Third of the way through: OH GOD!!!! He went there!!! Halfway: Please, please stop this... oh no, he's borrowing from everything I hold dear! Three quarters: *Mouth open in disbelief* This is TERRIBLE!!! End of book: Why, why didn't I listen?   I recently saw the trailer and thought "Wow, that really reminds me of A New Hope.You know, the scene where Luke is looking off into the sunset.." It isn't the unoriginality that made me hate the book, or the bloody mess Young Sky - I mean, Paolini made of the archetypes in the book, it was the tone the author used. That smug, smug tone.   This fills me with sadness for all the good writers out there who don't have the rich, influential parents to push their work to the top of the stack 
 I returned the pearl earings. They were of very poor quality. The colors were not pretty and the shapes were not even.         
 I have been a Betty Grable fan since I was small.  It is odd for a kid today to rather watch old movies than new ones.  I am now in my twenties and interested in bios.  Betty and Ginger Rogers have always been my favorites.  After reading this book, I do not like Betty Grable.  It seems as if the author and Ms. Grable are both very stuck on HER.  She seems VAIN from my understanding of the book.  I could not finish it because the more I read, the more I disliked her, and I want to enjoy her movies.  Ginger Rogers "Ginger: My story" and Ester Williams "Million Dollar Marmaid" autobiographies were much more interesting.  I suggest those over this one any day 
 In my personal opinion these tapes are cued extremely fast. I had a hard time keeping up, even after several attempts. Grrr. Very frustrating for a beginner seeking inspiration. Very disappointed! Pricey item down the tubes. 
 We bought this book for our 3 year old who is fascinated with dinosaurs. I was pleased with the illustrations and the easy to follow layout, but when we got to the T-Rex, Xenotarsosaurus and the Yangchuanosaurus, the pictures became too graphic for my son. For example, the T-Rex is carrying what looks to be a severed limb from another animal in it's mouth. I realize that some dinosaurs are meat eaters, but I was hoping this book was a little less explicit. I think this book could be better for an older child 
 I could not sit through this movie. The acting and screenplay are terrible. This film could be described as a bad made-for-tv movie at best.   I ended up fast-forwarding though the entire movie after the first 30 minutes and turned the player off before I reached the end. I couldn't take it anymore. This movie is one of the worst I've attempted to watch in a long time.    Not recommended.  
 My channeling class had an extremely unsettling experience following the  guidelines in this book. I recommend that this material be used with  extreme caution. Who are the "Angels of Karma"? Are they who they  claim to be 
 This is a beautiful book, but the coverage is overwhelmingly for geometric oriental rugs, with a large section added for Chinese.  I was looking for the more ornate styles (Heriz, Tabriz, Sultanabad, and so on) that are so very beautiful.  These are grossly underrepresented in this book, if at all (e.g., most are not).  I am sorry I purchased the book 
 This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The "show biz" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of "We Were Soldiers."--a much better, and far more honest, film 
 If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them.  This movie was not scary.  It would have been suspenseful if I cared for any of the characters.  You know what the best part was?  When it was over.  Few movies compel me to write reviews, good or bad.  This one obviously did 
 I purchased this book after reading reviews.  I debated between this one and Teach Your Tot to Sign.  However, I returned it within days of receiving it.  I realized I don't need activities - I can sign along with songs I already sing to my daughter or while doing everyday activities.  What we needed was a more complete list of signs.  This book was too limited.   My daughter is 11 months old and pointing at things constantly and I'd like to be able to teach her the sign at the time she's interested.  It didn't include signs that we need now, like balloon, apple, banana, clock, tree, bike. If you only want to teach your child a few basic signs and want to have fun doing it - this book will work, otherwise get something else.  I bought Teach  Your Tot to Sign and love it 
 Tells you what you should be doing but doesn't tell you how to do it. He explains what the quadrants are and goes in WAY too much detail describing the different types of people in these quadrants and does not tell you how to get from the employee quadrant to the investor quadrant. Makes suggestions like start a business or develop a business system. No mention on how to do that.   I just finished reading his Yahoo Finance article "A Taste for Debt" from 10/31/06 about upcoming tough financial times and he ends the article in typical Kioysaki (no explanation or in depth advice) fashion by saying "So what do I recommend? For now, enjoy the party, don't drink too much, and stay close to the exits".  Thanks for that Robert. I can't wait to not recommend and never buy one of your books again 
 THIS BOOK IS GARBAGE WHEN IT COMES TO THE HISTORY ABOUT THE HERBS AND MIKE CASTLEMAN STUDY'S ON HOW OLD THE VEDAS IS, IS INCORRECT. IT SEEMS THAT HE HAS TO STUDY MORE. HOW IA A PERSON GOING TO WRITE A BOOK WHEN HE GIVES YOU THE WRONG INFORMATION ON HOW OLD THE VEDAS IS COMMON 4500 YEARS OLD? IT'S MUCH OLDER THEN THAT. HE NEEDS TO STICK TO WHAT HE KNOWS, WHICH IS THE BIBLE 
 When I read the back cover of this book the story sounded interesting and gave the impression that something bad would happen in it. The first chapter - about the disappearance of the baby - was quite good, but thereafter it just dragged on without moving forward. I stuck with it thinking it would get better but it just didn't. It was told from different viewpoints, and the side from the cops was completely a waste of time. There was a lot of background and insight into the two girls but nothing that could hold your interest or even make you like them in any way. I thought the end too was just rushed and although it had a twist 
 Not since St. Augustine has there been such a whining, carping screed begging for Christian inculcation by a celebrated intellect. I'm not even sure why this is a book. A cranky letter to the dean, and president of the alumni association would have served his purpose, and saved a few trees as well.   Without going into detail, or needing to, you will find in a nutshell that Mr. Buckley feels it's fine for Yale faculty of faith to gently shepherd students toward Christian beliefs within their science and math classes, but it's a sin for the other, heathen, atheistic masters, to rampage through the clay of young minds and, in one semester, destroy the fragile faith of 18 to 20 years of Christian indoctrination. Pu-leese!  I'll grant you he was only 25, and at that time standing up for one's individual ideals was new, but why is it still in print!  On the other hand, in today's renewed climate of monkey-brained hysteria in the classroom perhaps it might seem to be time to dig up an old reactionary guru or two for validation. In fact, soon I wouldn't be surprised to hear that some addlebrained congressman was trying to pass a law mandating the teaching of Buckleism in schools.  Cool book title though!  
 I received 2 2.5mm to 3.5mm stereo headphone adapter. One didn't work. The other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality. If you push the headphone jack(male) all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker. You have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers. And even then the quality is not good 
 As a psychiatrist and person with mentally ill family members, I can only bemoan all of the misinformation contained in this book. The truth is that many of the mentally ill in America do not get the treatment they need precisely because they believe the things said in this book, on tv, etc. As someone who has lived outside of the US and in the developing world, I can tell you that their mental health treatment pales compared to what is available in the United States and is much more primitive and coercive. Although it is true that many psychiatric medications have serious side effects, the consequences of living with symptoms of a serious mental illness can only convince you of how devastating that can be to both the ill person and his or her family. Furthermore, as someone who is also experienced in administering ECT, I can personally attest to the wonderful success rate of this treatment for persons with severe depression who have failed all alternatives and who would rather be dead than live out their lives. (And many, unfortunately, do decide on death as a last resort).  As far as lobotomies, ice baths, and forced stays in hospitals or other facilities, these are things of the past in the United States. In fact, one of the biggest problems I face in my practice is the extreme difficulty I have in placing someone in the hospital when they actually need a brief stay (typical stays are 5-7 days) because of a lack of psychiatric beds ( more than 90% of psychiatric beds were eliminated from American hospitals in the last 15 years as a cost-cutting measure). The other problems faced by modern psychiatry still includes stigmatisation of the mentally ill and then all the more mundane issues such as needs for help with housing, employment, and job development. But I bet you wouldn't find the author writing a book about that 
 I admit that I tried to read this twice and failed both times.  I got to around page 20 or so.  I'll probably try again.  However, if you're an adult who has already read other philosophies I would suggest attempting to read it just so you'll know what Objectivism is about.  I wouldn't suggest it for teens that haven't had any prior readings, though.  Objectivism is about the self and about "reason", and it can be heady stuff for someone who has no real experience in anything else.   The strange thing about the tone of the writing is that it comes across as venomous.  I assume that's in my head, but judge for yourself.  Her caricatures of "The Witch Doctor" (who controls others from a spiritual perspective) and "Attila" (who controls by brute force) are actually interesting.  Wrong, but interesting.  Since Objectivists rely on reason alone for their survival (or think they do, anyway), it's rather surprising the lack of logical thinking early in the book.  My suggestion is to attempt to read it without dismissing her out of hand (she's not wrong on everything), or swallowing it all without using your own critical thinking skills. Judging by previous reviews, it seems there were plenty of both kinds of readers.  If you buy into it, you can get a feeling of superiority over others in a kind of pseudo-intellectual way.  If you don't buy into it, however, you're evil (either the Witch Doctor or Attila) and probably just too stupid to "get it".    Why I didn't finish it yet... I just couldn't get past her ignorance of history, frankly.   If you're writing a work of fiction, the historical innacuracies don't matter, but this isn't supposed to be fiction.  I like history and most people don't, so it probably won't bother most people.  Also, while she denounces religion, Ms. Rand has no problem hopping up to the pulpit herself.  Like all other religions and cults, the world is messed up basically because people don't think like she does.  
 Despite all the negative publicity, and my insistence that I wouldn't buy anymore of these books, I did.  My new rule ended up being that I would wait for the paperbacks.    So with Book 11 due in PB this fall, I decided to give this book another try.  You see, a couple years ago when it came out in paperback, I tried to read it.  I couldn't.  My friends told me just to read the last chapter and skip the rest.  I started reading anyway.  I put it down.  It is so boring; filled with so many people who I've never heard of, and lacking the best elements of the series (Rand v. Forsaken), that I couldn't do it.  Well, here I am again.  And I still can't read it.  And now I hear that Book 12 will end the entire series?  So we have a great first 5-6 books where tons of cool thing occur, a terrible next 4-5 books where nothing occurs, and then an ending where everything stops?  Just like that?  I now recommend that people read the first three books in the series and no more.  TDR is a good stopping place, although there's good stuff in books 4-5, they require a reader to want more.  Book 3 wraps it nicely.  Just pretend Ishamael was the Dark One, and you're all done.  What a tragedy to have created something so great and ruined it so thoroughly 
 the very thesis of this book is disturbing, and added with the fact that some people are ignorant enough to believe it is just shocking.  my grandparents are survivors of Auschwitz and have the tatoos to prove it, they lived through the nightmare along with many many others- including elie wiesel, who wrote/spoke extensively about his experiences at the hands of the nazis.  that anyone would actually believe this anti-genocidal propoganda is beyond me, should we next begin to disbelieve that the rwandan genocide happened? what about pol pots slaughter of millions?  this book is not worth any history teachers-such as myself- time, no matter how much you want to look at all sides of the picture to paint an authentic historical scene for your students.  
 His dog's name is Splash!!! Most well-educated people should understand why that is one of the most hilarious and annoying "coincidences". If this was bush's book, and he named his dog, oh, i don't know, Tex? i there'd be a huge amount of people laughing. But, since the Kennedy's are royalty, they are not laughed at. SPLASH!!! THE DOGS NAME IS SPLASH!!! I CANT GET OVER IT! 
 Nice coffee table book, but a great deal of Mails' stuff is either made-up or borrowed from squirrely popular romanticizations of Cherokee folks.  For a general if ideologically out-dated history, see Grace Steele Woodward, for culture see Mooney, Theda Perdue for work specifically on women, and for straight-up historical scholarship, try William McLoughlin's stuff 
 A more apt description of this video would be "The Floozie Workout."  If you are a woman and serious about fitness be prepared to be insulted by the two floozies featured with Tom Holland on this exercise video who provide unnecessary comic relief in this otherwise solid weight training workout video. The video is intended to provide a circuit training program to complement the Abs Diet, a diet developed and promoted by David Zinczkenko Editor-in-Chief of Men'sHealth magazine. The diet (details of which I won't elaborate on here) is a solid one and in many respects resembles the Weight Watcher Core program - it emphasizes a balance of protein, healthy fat, and complex carbs eaten in moderate portions.   The video provides three tracks - one for the absolute beginner, a second for intermediates and a third for those more advanced.  Frankly, the advanced track is not all that advanced.  If you are interested in weight training and have no experience (be sure to consult your physician before starting an exercise program), I suggest you start with the beginner circuit.  After several weeks when you feel confident, you should be able to tackle the intermediate circuit and shortly thereafter the advanced circuits.  If you are looking for a serious weight training workout you should strongly consider Jari Love's "Get Ripped" workout - more rigorous, emphasizes tempo training, and grows with you (many variations demonstrated/discussed other than merely increasing the weight). The video opens with a very short cardio workout and then segues into the beginner's workout.  Holland introduces each exercise and then takes the viewer through one set of reps.  He is accompanied by two women who carry very light weights and go through the motions.  If you truly want to make this a circuit you need to repeat the exercise circuit at least once if not twice.  The intermediate and advanced circuits feature the same basic exercises as in the beginner circuit but take it up a "notch" by adding light weight to some exercises and in the advanced doing double duty on others (upper body/lower body).  If you are in any kind of shape you will probably benefit the most by combining all three circuits sequentially as cued on the video.  The whole workout will take less than one hour.  Don't expect abs though.  If you want abs you really need to watch your diet - eat really clean - and do some serious core work and this workout just doesn't have it.  
 Look, the fact is feminism is about CHOICE no more, no less. I have the highest respect for stay at home moms--it is the hardest darn job on Earth. But this woman is WAY off base to say that feminism sold us a lie. Feminism GAVE us a choice. It told us we did not HAVE to pretend to believe we were June Cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls.   Personally, I could not have children and ONLY feminists have not made me feel like an alien species. I work with troubled teens, my skills do not go to waste, I spoil my nieces and nephews--I am fulfilled and happy. My sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys, she is fulfilled and happy,FEMINISM gave us those choices, ladies.   We were not "sold" ANYTHING, we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us. IF you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world's most important job, I think that is YOUR issue and not NOW's. Stop blaming feminism for YOUR insecurities, if you are feminist--stop blaming your mother for your insecurities--you have choices BECAUSE of FEMINISM not despite it! 
  They left out way to much!! I mean they kept going in circles with the same bands over and over again. Plus they dont mention alot of bands that had a big influence in the scene back in the day. Could have been way better 
 I was really looking forward to this book. I'm not sure when I have been so disappointed in a story after all of the hype.  I was raised in mid-west and expected a serious story about trials of a disfunctional family. What a total waste of time. Turd fantasy is not my idea of great literature. Worst book I have read since "Running with Scissors".  I don't need to waste my time on this psychotic drivel parading as great art 
 I worked my way through this,and kept asking myself why. This book is the product of a certain mind set in this country that props up certain points of views and tries to silence others, there simply is no other way to explain how this got published and, pick my jaw up off the floor, a movie made.  The writing is totally uninspired. Likewise the, uhh...plot. If there is a character, meaningful dialog, descriptive passage somewhere in this thing, please invite my attention. Swofford accomplishes only one thing: makes you real happy you don't have to spend time with him other than when you are struggling with his book. It doesn't matter how you feel about war, politics, life, or anything, this is just hard labor. Yes, I've done my time in the military and in combat. Swofford can't tell anyone anything, about the Corps, any military, combat, life, or putting one foot in front of another each day. Sadly, I think that this is a tragedy, because he had the opportunity to experience much, some of it even positve, but he missed it all. The people who put their names on the cover of this book and gave it favorable comment are dispicable 
 This magazine just dares people to pick the most boring, pretentious, or ostentatious feature within any given issue. "Town & Country" is an extremely old money venture, and while it does have some good and useful articles (and lovely advertisements for things that virtually nobody can afford,) much of the magazine is essentially centered on a very elitist worldview that grows very tiresome rather quickly.   "Town & Country" was initially recommended to me because of ostensibly good coverage of travel and architecture, two areas I have great interest in. As an applicable aside, when I read a list of tips in the offshoot "Town & Country Travel" publication on ways to ease the stress of long range flights, I realized there was a reality check due when one of the first tips was to always fly in first class, ignoring the fact that the vast majority of readers would rather buy a car with what a typical first class ticket to Europe or Asia costs.  As I mentioned, there are some good articles, and there are occasionally better and more useful offshoot publications like "Town & Country Travel" that are eminently more readable (although they still insist on advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes on the coast, etc.) I will say that the photography is always good, and you can believe that if it appears here that it is the finest and most fashionable available: Hyacinth Bucket would, no doubt, like to be seen reading this magazine.   Despite having occasionally worthwhile features, I find "Town & Country" to be excessively pompous, therefore I recommend finding another publication focused on whatever area of interest you have, whether it is fashion, society, or travel. 
 i wanted this dvd because i wanted to be scared and i like the ideas of haunted house, honestly this movie was a joke yes it had a story but effects were terrible there was nothing scary about it you could tell that all the bodys and heads and arms that were being hacked off were fake.  i wish i could get my money back id rather go with psyco , motherday,the omen amityvill horroe the excoris 
 I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!! 
 It certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that knowledge-based workers are the future in American Society. It seems to me that Drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize Marx, which was a complete failure. Drucker didn't even fully analyze Globalization in its entirety.  The only credit that should be given to this book is his analyzation of the American worker. Nonetheless, he offers a limited viewpoint on all aspects of society. Look elsewhere if you want to get a better understanding of where our world is headed and what state we are in. Drucker neglects the whole and simply accepts what backs his own perspective 
 If you are in the kindergarden and you need a book, take this on 
 This book's greatest flaw is, undoubtedly, its predictability.  It naturally has the descriptive and creative style of Scott, but the plot moves too logically from high point to high point with very little between.  There are very few "plot twists," and those which do occur are far from surprising.  From the book's outset, the story proceeds rapidly to the obvious tragic ending and seems to repeat regularly.  This ending also seems hurried and completely unbelievable.  The characters are poorly developed and, rather than seeming independent and realistic, seem to be nothing more than puppets forced to follow the extremely depressing plo 
 Although this is a good coffee, I was expecting something that tasted like a cappuccino.  This coffee tastes nothing like it, it doesn't even have a hint of cinnimon flavor as the package suggests.  If you want regular coffee, then this is the coffee to buy, but if you're looking for cappuccino, save your money

 One of the many problems with this book is the order in which the topics are presented.  Right off the bat, They decide to put linear equations ahead of all other types of DE's.  Are they really as simple to solve as seperable equations?  The entire second chapter is a complete mess and is very disorganized.  The forumla for the integrating factor of linear equations is difficult to ascertain, and it is never clearly stated (it's there, but their notation is convoluted).  I don't want to sound like someone who is just having difficulty with the math taking it out on the innocent textbook.    I have consulted other textbooks on the topic, and I have to say that I really like Zill's DE's for the logical way in which it is organized, and    Kohler and Johnson's text for its clear explanations.  My professor actually commented on how bad this book is.  All DE textbooks are NOT created equally, and if you are struggling through this one, try finding older editions of those other two from your University's library.    
 If you release a second edition you need to support a second edition, that includes the publisher's website and the downloadable scripts that go with the book....this book is okay, but who has time to type in all of the sample scripts to learn. For not including the scripts I give it a 2 
 Chasteen's book is a Marxian historiography.  One of the interesting things about books like Chasteen's is that the reader does not immediately realize, and sometimes never does, that the author has an agenda that goes beyond documenting history; and I think it is important that Born in Blood and Fire is identified as a Marxian viewpoint.  The author frequently asserts his opinion, matter-of-factly. Chasteen's disdain of liberalization and capitalism makes it very clear that he is positing Latin America would have been better off without these modern advents.  Of course, this is only his point of view, but in the context of this book, a textbook, students should be aware that his opinions are not "A Concise History of Latin America."  Agree or disagree, this book must be read critically, not swallowed whole.   	Reading about Mexican liberalization from Chasteen, I was able to pick through his arguments to find just the facts; and I could even selectively use his own words to paint a more favorable, and to some, truer, depiction of liberalization in Latin America.  However, Chasteen is selective in his arguments and, hence, paints a much drearier picture.  For instance, where Chasteen discusses the arrival of the railroad, he says it "drove a lot of peasants off the land, allowing the landlords to extend their holdings, make landless peasants their employees, and multiply their profits."  One can also sum up this situation by saying liberalization in Mexico helped establish property rights and the arrival of the railroad raised property values and created jobs for millions of landless, jobless peasants.  Although Chasteen does mention the benefits of liberalization, he minimizes them and doesn't note them as accomplishments, but merely side-notes.  Using an admitted "extreme example," Chasteen tells his readers that just three families owned a third of the land in Colima.  What the average reader won't know is that Colima is a relatively small state in Mexico, and three families owning a third of the land means there were three families that owned around 550 kilometers of land each.  Chasteen doesn't give his illustration any more thought than a simple sentence because it is there for shock value only.  Two sentences in chapter 6 illustrate the overarching theme of Chasteen's book:  "This basic power structure facilitated a half century of economic transformation that benefited a quarter of the population at the expense of everybody else,"   "The influence of outside examples was not all bad, of course," where Chasteen is essentially conceding that his history of Latin America entails, by and large, a negative influence from the U.S. and Europe.      	By Chasteen's definition of "neocolonialism," any country that the U.S. imports raw materials from is a neocolony; or any country which the U.S. helps achieve independence, or which we liberate, opens free trade with, and has a close political alliance with the United States is a neocolony.  But how many people would describe post World War Two Japan as a U.S. colony?  Chasteen's account of Latin American history is rabidly anti-American.  Even in describing women's liberation in the Americas, Chasteen ignores the fact that the U.S. first had women's suffrage and with our great cultural, political, and economic influence over Latin America, provoked women's liberation in countries throughout the region - this idea is not even explored in Chasteen's book.  It may seem like I am painting a "rosy" picture of U.S. - Latin American affairs; but if I wrote a history on this subject, both the good and the bad would be explored in detail.  It is a sign of intellectual laziness to revert to a simple - blame America - approach to history; and this is my major gripe with Chasteen's book.  Much of his account is, indeed, true.  However, he is selective in his history and chooses a course of anti-Americanism rather than an objective historical perspective.   
 I have read 3 books of Ann in last 3-4 months and no doubt loved it, but not sure If I am reading same info in different books with different titles from her.    I guess I am not buying this title and anymore of her unless it has way different contents...  
 This book reminds me of a false advertisement: pick it up and it sounds interesting, even those first crucial lines pull you in and then... Then we are pulled along on a tortuous journey into a writer's ego.  This book is written in the kind of style that you want to be beautiful, even lyrical - Instead it's more often confusing.  By page 17 I was skipping forward in hopes that it became more compelling.  There is a languid air to Mr. Jordan's writing, which is fine as long as we care about what happens or why.  Why the main character is killed by her childhood friend (no suprises, we know the killer's name on page one)is perhaps the clearest paragraph and half of the book. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until page 268, by then I was just glad to be done with it all.  Mr. Jordan's screenplays are wonderful, but this book is pure self-indulgence.  
 I gave it two stars because while I didn't hate it, it was dull and predictable.  I see beter plots on TV's Starsky and Hutch.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't have to use subtitles; I found myself more interested in looking at the text than watching the movie.  I know, that's only my opinion, but I watch a lot of DVD's and I think I know what I like and don't like 
  The theme suggested by the title is fine, but the author does not stick with his agenda. This book is full of erratic observations, not least the notion that Jung was a fellow traveler with the Nazis. Anyone who has read Jung at all well, would know that he devoted considerable energy to the task of trying to understand the 'unreason' which seized hold of the German spirit (Jung actually regarded it as a kind of collective 'posession' by the spirit of Wotan). Unlike Heidegger (and Nietzsche), Jung remained grounded in the positive values of Western civilisation - including democracy. He did not turn his back on 2,500 years of Graeco-Roman/Judeo-Christian culture. To allege that he did is sheer nonsense and exceedingly poor scholarship.   Unfortunately, Wolin seems utterly unable to see that there are paradoxes in life - and human reason. In his assessment, America comes out as the exemplary source of 'rational' culture - as against a quirky Europe, prone to unreason and crippling scepticism. But, in its present mode -dominated by Neo-con philosophy, advocating 'full spectrum dominance' ('Amerika uber alles,' we might say) - some scepticism seems needed right now. There is a new 'Macarthyism' at work in the USA - and it is driven by hubris and UNREASON. 'Star wars'is hardly the attribute of a 'rational' culture. America has few friends in the world today  - and why? Because its current administration has abdicated from the principles ostensibly lauded in Wolin's book. Quite rightly, that worries many Americans - and platitudes like those served up by Wolin will not make the problem go away.    The zenophobia in Wolin's book is part of the problem - not part of the solution. For Wolin, even Europe is 'alien' - so, how much more so is he likely to find problems relating to other, non-caucasian cultures? In this sense - a fatal flaw runs through Wolin's book. He fears fascism - but advocates an agenda whereby one culture stands in judgement of every other, ready to use force - if needs be, in any corner of the world - to protect and assert its alleged superiority - and that, by definition - is fascism. Paranoia and reason don't make good partners. 
 It's not actually written by Crowley and is not at all what I expected. It has some pictures of demons and angels and a few short invocations, but not much substance 
 I did not like this book at all and I would not recommend purchasing it. You are better off purchasing a cookbook that offers healthy eating recipes instead of this book.  
 All I got was some very average Beethoven performances from Leonard Bernstein, a conductor usually renowned for his extrovert, fascinating approach to various music but who so misses the mark with this dull cycle of the greatest symphonies of all time. One of the main problems is possibly the fact that Bernstein chose to record this cycle, ( his 2nd cycle of Beethoven symphonies ), with the Vienna Philharmonic. His earlier one was with the New York Philharmonic and that was a lot more youthful and vigorous. These Vienna versions are much more mellow and relaxed, I love the Vienna Philharmonic but they've played this music to death and I don't think they can really be inspired, full-throttle like a younger, less tradition ingrained orchestra. And to add insult to injury, Karajan's Berlin Philharmonic was always much superior in these years in terms of virtuosity, finesse, power and everything you need to feel the impact of Beethoven.  Still, the Vienna Philharmonic is one of the finest orchestras in the world and it leaves it up to the conductor to truly inspire them. This is where Bernstein fails, every single one of these symphonies is safe, lackluster and middle of the road. Let's take a quick, one by one analysis of the works.  Symphony 1 is done with charm and grace, Bernstein obviously enjoying the mood but I miss the sprint and attack that Karajan brings to this music. Symphony 2 is where Bernstein truly shines, he puts in plenty of power and concentration throughtout and the slow movement, the larghetto, is gorgeous. All in all, a success. Symphony 3, the Eroica is where the trouble starts. It's boring, it's deflated, it's dull compared to Bernstein's earlier New York version and Bernstein typically falls flat on his face when compared to Karajan or Klemperer in the Eroica. The funeral march by Bernstein can put you to sleep, where is the emotional gravity that Karajan brings to it in his devastating digital record? Symphony 4 is good but not great, a general run through with a few interesting touches. Symphony 5 is a dismal failure, the famous first movement is the worst I've ever heard. It's obscenely slow, 8 minutes, 38 seconds! Compare that to most versions which average like 7 minutes, 20 seconds. The rest of the symphony is nothing special but at least better than the atrocious first movement. The Pastoral symphony is well played but isn't in the league with Karl Bohm or Vladimir Ashkenazy. Symphony 7 is one of the best performances of the Bernstein cycle, with lots of energy and drive. Symphony 8 is humorous and lively, not massive like Karajan, but that's ok.   Finally, Symphony number 9 is where you should hear true fireworks from Bernstein, instead you get your typical run through as if this was some background music. The choral finale especially is a total let down compared to Solti's magnificient 1972 version or Karajan's 1977 recording. I hope Bernstein's later performance for the coming down of the Berlin Wall is not as routine as what I hear here. I have yet to hear that famous record.  All Beethoven symphonic cycles are eventually disappointing because no one conductor can approach perfection in every one of these works. Bernstein succeds in symphonies 2 and 7 in this set, but that's really it, the rest are average or worse. Karajan's early 1960's cycle is the one to go for if you desperately need a complete set by one conductor. It's not perfect but the most satisfactory available.  For individual symphonies, try Karajan in symphony 1, Karajan, Szell or Bernstein in symphony 2. For the Eroica, Karajan's digital version or Klemperer's 1961, Szell and Furtwangler are also great. Symphony 4 goes to either Szell or Karajan, Symphony 5 to Giulini, Furtwangler, Karajan and Kleiber. The Pastoral goes to Bohm and Ashkenazy or Bruno Walter. The 7th goes to God knows who, I haven't found a perfect Seventh, yet! Try Thielemann, Furtwangler or Bernstein. Go with Karajan's digital version for the 8th symphony. Last but not least, Solti, 1972 for the the Choral Symphony, as well as Karajan, 62, 77 and Furtwangler, 51, 42, all great.  Man, that sounds like a lot, but that's Beethoven for you. You can't ever find the perfect interpretation, because they simply don't exist 
 I LOVED this book!  I think my designs are so much better now that I know when to open and close the windows at the right time!  I was always so confused before.  I can also make sure that I get good air flow by drawing those great ribbon arrows. This book is perfect for anyone who has never looked at the sky or felt the wind before or chooses to ignore their own senses!  I think Brown could of done this without DeKay though.  RULES-O-THUMB LUV 
 I ordered 14 Eric Carle books because I loved his hungry catterpiller, polar bear and brown bear books however the 14 others I ordered were very disappointing.  I never have time to go to the post office or else I would have returned every single one including this book 
 After falling in love with Gourmet's yellow cookbook, I subscribed to Gourmet, hoping for the same great classic recipes and commonsense commentary.  Wow, what a disappointment.  I have just received my second issue and, as another reviewer said, it is about 90% ads for high-end luxury goods like jewelry and cars.  The 6-page "Special Advertisement Section" stops being so special when there are 20 of them in one issue! What happened, Ruth Reichl?  The few recipes that one can find are unattractive and/or too difficult for even weekend cooking. For those cooks looking for a great cooking magazine, I highly recommend Bon Appetit over Gourmet: the majority of the magazine is recipes and cooking tips, with only interspersed ads.  I will be calling to see if I can get my subscription switched tomorrow. 
 This book was very helpul in learning about how to handle my dog 
 We were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday.  After opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied.  However the screen is very disappointing.  I can't even rate the games because overall I simply just can't see what is on it.  The product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing.  I should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products.  I would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it 
 "Torn Togas" could not only be the worst written book  grammatically ever to be published, it as also the most factually  inaccurate book I have ever read.  I heard of this book after watching an  episode of Oprah that dealt with hazing across the country.  Being a  fraternity man myself, I am interested in learning more about Greek life  anyway I can, so I bought the book.  While I was reading it I was  absolutely flabbergasted at the biases and stereotypes this woman had about  members of college fraternities and sororities.  She may feel that just  because she was in a sorority herself, that it is alright to say the things  that she did, but I truly feel that she was out to write a book that would  sell copies and she tried to make it as interesting as she could.  I would  recommend this book to anyone who would like to experience how it feels to  be Greek and deal with the discrimination and prejudices that people have.   I do not know where this woman went to college for her undergraduate work,  but if the stuff she says that went on there actually did happen, how does  the Greek community there still exist?  Where I go to school, I have never  heard or even thought of 25% of the things she said went on at her campus.   This book is a slap in the face to anyone that is an undergraduate,  graduate, or a family member of anyone that has ever been in a Greek letter  organization.  How much credibility can you give a "so-called"  Greek when she can't even spell the names of the Greek letters right?  This  book would be a waste or money, time, and brain cells to anyone who would  purchase it 
 I am a fan of modest mouse at least most of there stuff I didn't like long drive loved moon and antartic and thought lonesome crowded west was good this one however has only one good song to offer the fruit that ate itself is a great song well worth downloading better than any song on long drive or lonesome crowded west but the rest of the cd is garbage so save your money and download that one song 
 I hope "Duets: The Final Chapter" is the last thing released by BIG. Puffy/Diddy needs to stop trying to make money off of Biggie's old material and let him rest in peace. "Duets: The Final Chapter" just contains old Biggie material remixed and re-worked into new songs. The only release I want to see of Biggie is to have "Ready to Die" back into print and a 10th anniversary of "Life after death" in 2007 wouldn't bother me too much. Buy Puffy/Diddy needs to stop trying to make new Biggie material by re-working his old material. And acording to Amazon's editorial reviews of tis product, There will be a limited edition CD/DVD which includes never before seen performance footage, celebrity interviews and vintage Biggie videos. That dvd needs it own release. This cd is not good at all. The only decent tracks on this cd are the ones with his other and kids. And That is where I tunes come in handy. I wouldn't be surpised if Bad Boy released their own version of Queen Latifah's "Dana Ownes Album" entitled "The Christopher Wallace Album" 
 Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like " no wonder men leave us for younger woman". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud 
 This book is sponsored by the American Council for Cultural Policy and is an excellent illustration that this organization is completely devoid of ethics. The various articles in the volume detail how the 'innocent' art and antiquities dealer and collector could and should be protected by U.S. law, all the while defaming the rights and plight of Native Americans, victims of Nazi appropriations, and countries suffering from massive art market-driven looting, to name only a few. Property laws figure heavily in these debates, but naturally the question of how stolen or looted art and antiquities become the 'property' of collectors and dealers is answered in such ways as to show the dealers and collectors as the true victims of both the thefts and the judicial systems. Although the book is claimed as a balanced discussion of the many complex issues surrounding the ownership of cultural property, it is clearly in the corner of the wealthy dealers and collectors (and their lawyers). 
 I began to read this book with the hope there would be some new insights but very soon it became clear that the author did not understand his subject well enough to accurately explain basic physics. When I am told that an accelerating system is in equilibrium I am not impressed. The bad physics even detracted from any value as a historical read. If the author can't explain accurately the basic ideas of the book how badly is the historical information being twisted to serve his conclusions. I put a note inside the cover telling my grandkids to read this one with a critical eye 
 Pick up any dictatorial king from the past world and read any writing about him by one of his blind followers, whose very existence and relevance is due to that king. What you will get from that kind of writing? Noonan was a speechwriter Reagan administration. Sound familiar? Noonan does not get how ordinary citizens used to live under the rule of kings and how they felt about kings. Probably she does not care. Americans are lucky that they never had any king. Noonan fails to provide any inside information how Reagan dealt with many difficult things of his presidency - AIDS, Iran-Contra, welfare, deficits, funding mujahideens, cozy relationship with Saddam. Instead she tried to portray his 8 years like a Disney feelgood fairytale - good ruler, happy citizens..."happily lived ever after". Basically, this book contains just glorification of a person who is viewed as king by the writer.  Her admiration took away her basic ability of criticism and desire to provide any information that readers don't know already. This is a writing isolated from the reality of 80's (which is nothing new in human civilizations). Secondly, she fails to understand that Reagan was just an elected politician and many have contributions on whatever achieved in his 8 years of presidency - including average hard-working Americans. But she gives ALL the credits to Reagan, except all the negative things, like Iran-Contra. In the world of democracy this book deserved to be in trash - a perfect place for the kings, characters of kings and the writings about them 
 If you were a Ludlam fan, and begin reading this book, you will be reminded immediately that he is dead.  How sad that a byline has turned into a trademark.   If you have a distaste for subtlety, and prefer ideas repeated and underlined in red, buy this book.  Shameful exploitation of a decent name 
 This book is not written for those of us that have been overindulging for years.  It is written for the folk that are on the verge of becomming an alcoholic.  "You must still be in the early stages of problem drinking" "You've engaged in problem drinking for 5 years or less"  It is stated numberous times in the first few chapters that the program is not for problem drinkers.  She goes on to define the alcoholic, and state again that her program is not for YOU!  I want my money back 
 Once again a conservative minister with traditional views thinks women needed a man to not only think FOR them...but to tell us what WE are actually thinking!!!!! If you want to know what wives wish their husbands knew, ask a real wife. If you want to enhance your traditional conservative marriage, this book is for you. Otherwise, not good for modern couple 
 Do not misunderstand me: this book is fun. Problem is, it is only fun while it could have been really good and I hate to see good ideas wasted.  The writing itself is no more than straightforward: there are several clumsy turns of phrase, many repetitions, some shabbyness here and there.  The main problem is the plot we have no real mistery or thriller or whatever, just an excuse of a plot to introduce the main character, Ms Anita Blake, 24 y.o. -is she not just a little too young?- necromancer and ***-kicker. She is thrown with us into a bulging heap of violence and/or bodice ripping situations, facing countless (and I mean COUNTLESS) characters, none of which satisfyingly rounded: Anita spends all of her time ***-kicking, deciding how to dress to hide her guns or whether she is ready to die horribly. I am not saying she is not a nice character because she is, she even has a depth -but once again, can someone so young have such clear sighted symptathetic cynism?- though she tends to repeat the same puns too often.  A pity, there are some breathtaking paragraphs, others are excellent, the author seems to be able to move her pawns when she wants to: Phillip, for example, one of Anita's companions in her adventure is outright lovely and could have been perfect with just a little more concentration.  Let us see whether this first volume is just a warm up for better things to come 
 To cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _Left Behind_ would take a whole book.  One hardly knows where to start.  Perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to Christian religion by this trashy novel.  As such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  Worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the Bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.  The comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  Even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  One gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  God ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side Or Else.  Whatever happened to the inspiring Christian writers of yesteryear?  Who is the present-day equivalent of C. S. Lewis, or Catherine Marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  These were writers who actually made you THINK.  LaHaye and Jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing God wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  They show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  One wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.  These days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of Ann Coulter or Pat Robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn Christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  Perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  If _Left Behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from Christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind 
 A beginning crafter with little computer experience will probably really enjoy this book. It's got some great very beginning, easy projects.  If you have any graphics and graphic software experience at all, this book will waste your time. It was written in 1998, which in Internet years is approaching the stone age. Sorry to bias the stats, but I'm a graphics professional and was looking for more like some of the new image tranfer technique books.  
 Even for the most enthusiastic fans of New Pornographers, 'destroyer's rubies' has none of that groups passion or skill. This is Robyn Hitchcock meets Go-betweens, with the self-conscious zaniness of Bowie at his worst and a couple of Pink Floyd progressions thrown in. The lyrics are pretty common college stuff. No big deal really, but it's not awful. 
 I was not impressed by this book. No new insights or solutions - same old information 
 this remake of the better than ever original is loud,crude,gory,and worst of all DULL!!!!! a waste of time and not one real fright to be had. buy the original instead 
 I can't believe this book was a finalist for the National Book Award! Although it was well written in the sense of grammar and vocabulary, it was not an effective vehicle to introduce readers to the subject. I live in Appalachia, and I feel this book in some way demeans the practices of these persons religion. It starts out with a reporter covering a murder trial where a "snake handler" forces his wife to be bitten in the hopes that she will die so he can have another woman. I would have loved the court dialog and more of a background of the alleged "crime."  I definitely would have found more background information on the snake handlers interesting, and also more information about the strychnine; where they get it, how they know ratio to mix with water, etc. Strychnine from churches around my home has been found to be "non-lethal" doses.   As it is, with it's wide margins and double/triple spacing I think it would have been better printed as a long article in the New York Times, for which Mr. Covington writes about the South 
 I found the book informative while reading it, but also a bit confusing and a little dry, best used for a college course and not for recreational reading.  (Which is no doubt why we even had it in our house, someone had  to use it and it's equally boring companion for some college course, I'm  certain of it... 
 My hinge pin broke on one side during second use.  I was still able to use to with caution, then within the year the second hinge pin broke, now unable to use.  Seems to be a common problem!  
 Borders on unreadable.  It's a joke that respected math professors and textbook reviewers all think of this book as a classic.  Although widely praised when it first came out back in the 1940's, you have to remember that it was also the first book on the subject published in English.  Not at all recommended for students approaching this material for the first time 
 One of the greatest film music tragedies is that two of Silvestri's greatest scores, Back to the Future and Predator, have never seen a decent commercial release.  Predator 2 is like the original movie score but worse,  with lots of Caribbean rhythms thrown in.  It was appropriate for the film,  but this kind of music is something I don't really care for.  It gets  really redundant and tiresome after a while.  I think there are 3 decent  tracks on this CD.  Track 1, the main title, is a good listen, and the  Caribbean percussion is fun to listen to at this point, when it's fresh and  you haven't yet been beaten senseless over the head with it.  Track 3 is  cool because it rehashes music from Predator 1, which is completely  acceptable.  Track 11 is a good end credits suite of the score, with a  solid cover of the Predator theme.  Really though, it's a shame the second  movie was so stupid... maybe we would have gotten a better score 
 I bought this DVD for my daughter who is from China and though I think Xiao Foo is adorable, I am disappointed by Big Bird's behavior. Not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way, but he tells Barkley at one point to "sic" the Monkey King and then later, again frustrated, tells the Monkey King to put his dukes up (as if to fight to resolve the issue). I am appalled by this.  Big Bird is also somewhat demeaning to the Chinese people he encounters--they don't understand him because he is speaking English and rather than explain the language barrier, he just gets upset. I love Sesame Street, and although I will keep this DVD to hear Xiao Foo sing in Chapter 7 (our daughter just loves her), I feel I will need to use Big Bird's behavior as an example of how not to act 
 i read this book the reveng of the whale.it is about a huge sperm whale that attacks a ship that is trying to capturen it.they are trying to kill it beacuse of the sperm oil it has.they bring it back to land and sell it.i didnt like the book becase it didnt really have a main charecter.all it talked about is what the ship did and how they capiutur the whales.i also didnt like it because i thought it was going to have more action in it.most of the time ther just sailing and not really doing anything really exiting.it also dont really have a story line all it talkes about is what the ship is doing.it has no charecter conflicts.i was expecting more fights seenes with the whale and i would have hopped the would have discribed the whale better and how it attacked the ship more.some of the things i did like about it was it had one vwery god part in it.when the capterd one of the whales.it told how the got it and what they had to do to get it.i also like the pictures in the book it showed what the whales looked like and all the tools they had.i really didnt like this book but if you read it mabey you will u might be suprised 
 At all of 43 pages this book is certainly not worth the price. Most of the information is useful only if you've never heard of detectors or coin hunting. That said, the author is enthusiastic and does give some ideas for beginners 
 The 2nd Edition Exam Cram has been surplanted by "A+ Exam Cram 2," a thoroughly revised and  updated version of the book. The new book takes advantage of our new partnership with Que Publishing, and includes an interactive CD-ROM with, not only practice tests, but the entire book in electonic format. --Craig Landes, Author (11/02 
 For an adult beginner, this book is of very limited value. It cannot be used to learn the piano, but is only a general guide for someone who already has a substantial musical background. I would not buy this book if  you are an absolute beginner other than to read a sometimes interesting  story about how a more advanced player practices and learns to play the  pian 
 Just plain common sense. There wasn't profound thought through out the whole book.  I finished in thirty minutes 
 I really did'nt like this book at all. I think that it is a very confusing and lame story. Sorry no hard feelings. I mean there was nothing there to keep me motivated and interested in reading it. You talked alot about Econ throughout the story which I thought was very cool, just for the simple fact this is for my Econ class. Its like your telling life time stories about yourself and others. You sure do have alot of characters throughout the book. Overall I think that the book is okay its just not a book for me 
 Land of Little Interest would be a better title; it looks like even old Cactus Ed didn't read beyond the first chapter.  All the references he makes in his introduction are from the beginning of the book, and he seems to ignore the rest of the book, as I wish I had.  Boring, unless you want to know about what grows next to irrigating ditches.  And I still don't know what the hell a "campoodie" is (a term used over and over), but, who cares 
 It is all about common sense. Does not really help those with poor credit scores 
 Unfortunately this book has been selected as one of our reading materials for a certain examination I am currently studying for.  The worked examples in the book are not always clear which is fair enough, as it is not the first such book.  Normally this problem is ironed out by working thru the set problems at the back of each chapter.  What is very DISAPPOINTING about this text is that it is the only one in our entire syllabus of reading materials that does not have a Solutions Manual to help with our studying.  Mr Damodaran has not bothered making the effort to produce one it seems 
 In this book, Lessing has an ax to grind against the kids--so noisy, so dirty, so infuriatingly idealistic about the left politics she herself has abandoned.  Naturally those idealistic kids are really thieves, liars, manipulative, clinically crazy, and...terrorists!  Lessing is a writer strongly motivated by spite, particularly spite against ideas about which she has become disillusioned.  (In fact, she has some very interesting things to say about the functions of spite in parts of the Golden Notebook.)  Unlike her disillusioned writing about the left in the Children of Violence cycle and the Golden Notebook, this book contains not one person who is both an ordinary, functional human being and a person who seriously believes that society can be improved--and even her disillusioned former-liberal characters have rolled over to Thatcherism with such feeble excuses about the laziness and pettiness of the youth!  Her villains are laughably crazy and manipulative--at least the villainous left wingers in the Golden Notebook were complex enough that you could understand their power.  (An awful lot of people who have never done political activism or met a left-wing person read this book and assume that it really depicts the world of activists, because people who don't really care too much about politics assume that those who do are crazy zealots.)  Lessing's other, better work shows that world more accurately in both its bright and dark aspects. (On that note, I feel that Lessing has written herself out about the left by the end of the Children of Violence cycle--later, wonderful books like Diary of a Good Neighbor and merely very good books like Mara and Dan deal with new issues.  One of the amazing things about Doris Lessing is that where many writers go through one or at most two big themes/phases in their writing careers, she has gone through, oh, four or five.) 
 Mcmurtrys new album really disappoints.  I am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with James past work (as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical).  While Mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza (See the Elephant) or that provide an echo to the way we Americans spend our time (Holiday), his attempts on Childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing.  In past attempts Mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of Americana, yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside. The thoughtfulness evaporated on this work.   Like many aging musicians, Mcmurtry could not resist the tempation to jump into personal politics to replace the vacuum of meaningful verse.  The cliche and empty "We Cant Make It Here" is a meaningless mix of 70s era socialism and the ills of modern era entitlement policies that displays an ignorance of both democracy and personal responsibility.  Mcmurtry, previously able to frame an issue, seems oblivious that those of different political persuasions could easily fit the same song title to a wholly opposed set of social ills.   Criticism is not intelligence, and we can only hope that Mcmurtry can get on track going forward.  Perhaps he should shun the  "PC Crowd" and seek his own space and more thoughtful views of the complex but substantial American Scene for his next album 
 Out of all the cr appy punk-pop bands that have come out since Green Day, Simple Plan have to be the worst of the entire bunch! The band basically invented the whole "let's write songs about our awful lives and call it emo". Another thing, can you really name any members of this band other than Pierre Bouvier? Don't worry, you don't need to. Nothing about this pile is good from the whiney lyrics to the lame guitar playing of Jeff Stinco(okay I can name one but that's it).  A lot of people describe Simple Plan's lyrics as "poetic" and "emotional". Here's some lyric examples:  "Yesterday was the worst day ever,  And tomorrow won't be better it's history repeating  On and on  Summer plans are gone forever  I traded them in for dishpan water  And everyday is never ending  I need to work I'm always spending"  "I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare  I'm just a kid I know that it's not fair  Nobody cares cause I'm alone and the world is  Having more fun than me  (Tonight)"  One of the worst parts as well is Pierre's horribly whiney voice. It sounds like this: "WAAAAAAAAAAAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! MYYYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy LIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiifffffEEEEEE SUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuccccccccccccKKKKKKKKKKKKKKSSSSSS!!!!!!" *ears start bleeding*  So here we end yet another review of yet another very cr a p py album by a very cr a p py band. Thus say The Metal Master 92... 
 This film began as a beautiful European historical period piece, in Paris, which lush costumes, gorgeous people, etc. But after an hour, it deteriorated into incredibly boring melodrama with Binoche placed in alternating picturesque European cities and sex scenes. No deep emotions are penetrated, more than many other Binoche vehicles like "Chocolat" and "The Horseman on the Roof". I couldn't wait for it to end -- it's 2 hours seemed like 4 
 I read this book after reading "The Wal-Mart Effect" (by Charles Fishman), and I immediately noticed that I didn't like the writing style in The Google Story (and trust me there was an extreme contrast between these books).  I think the title sums my aggravations up nicely: "The Google Story: Inside the Hottest Business, Media, and Technology Success of Our Time".  It seems to me that Vise is always trying to inflate the facts and turn them into some sort of sensational story (when he even bothers to use facts instead of a bunch of editorial).  Another thing that bugs me about this book is how Vise tries to inflate the "battle" between Microsoft and Google and make it sound like they are arch-rivals.  Google and Microsoft are operating in different spaces in the technology world currently.  Microsoft's bread and butter is Operating Systems, professional office software, IDEs, etc.  Google's bread and butter is advertising.  Sure, there might be a battle for the best corporate culture, but it's not like Microsoft releases Windows Vista and the Google team scrambles to release Google Earth 4.0 to show them up.  Vise also cites a speech given by Eric Schmidt at a school in Washington to illustrate this "battle" between companies.  I personally found Eric Schmidt's speech to be banal and irritating, and a mark against Google rather than for.  He sure did "attack Microsoft on their home ground", but how cool is that?  Schmidt pretty much acted like a jerk and tried to snatch up the best and brightest from a school in Microsoft's back yard so he could "flip the bird" to Steve Ballmer (who by the way is also a big jerk, so no big deal there).  But Vise makes it sound like it was some covert mission into enemy territory to make the world a better place.  As others have noted, there's no real wealth of "insider" knowledge on Google here.  I was hoping for a more technical book (e.g. I wanted more info on their clustering technology and less info on their investors).  He mentions that there was a fire that wiped out one of their data centers and their search engine coped with no problems.  How?  Doesn't it seem as if there would be a problem if a data center was taken out?  What about the search requests that were being processed by that data center at that time?  Still, I gave this book 2 stars.  Larry and Sergey were the saving grace, because their charisma and story somehow manages to shine (however dim or brief) through the pages of this book.  Because of that, I was able to get some value from this book.  But, I was able to derive value in spite of the author rather than because of the author 
 FBTOH is way out of date, not dealing with the best of Louis Kahn's work, which doesn't neatly fit any of Mr. Wolfe's  categories. I wonder how he would categorize Frank Gehry, whose work came after the writing. I am intimately familiar with Bauhaus Fever, having survived its convusive early days (early 1950s)in the Department of Architecture at Penn, where the students revolted against the Beaux Arts tradition. Having experienced that first-hand and also having been turned off by Mr. Wolfe's public image, I avoided this book until June 2006, when I broke down and borrowed it, hoping to learn a bit more about the Bauhaus as an idealistic socio-political movement, somewhat of a Protestant Revolution. All I learned: 1)The Bauhaus stank of garlic, and 2)Mr. Wolfe's writing is toxic and best avoided by those who prefer peace of mind to rabble-rousing. 
 This book has some (okay, maybe even a lot of) un-funny jokes that don't make much sense (non-sequitar), but it has some good ones and my younger siblings enjoy reading it 
 I can't believe how many people rave about this book. I just finished it today and it was probably one of the most shallow, superficial books I have read in a very long time. New York women all acting like spoiled little girls, the whole story reminds me of the Barbie phenomenon. It they were to make a movie out of this book, they should use all the Barbie characters and let's nor forget about Ken! Such a waste of time 
 This book begins with the absurd claim that 'the natural numbers -1, 2,3, 4 etc- appear to have been present at the birth of the universe; part and parcel of the original material from which was knit the ever-expanding continuum of space-time.' The author does not explain in whose mind these numbers are supposed to have appeared or how a concept can be present without a mind to concieve it. Like many mathematicians he seems unable to grasp that mathematics is a language. Thus it's not uncommon to hear ridiculous statements like 'the universe is governed by mathematics' As if numbers exert forces. But this is the first time I've encountered the claim that numbers existed prior to life!   
 Lauren Slater was prescribed Prozac in 1988 when the pharmaceutical first came out.  She recalls having an almost immediate and "blissed out" feeling.  Slater says that Prozac made her "high" and goes on and on about it obsessively as she describes her reaction to Prozac as, "the single most stunning experience of my life."  This is rather melodramatic.  I have tried Prozac and I have been depressed throughout my life.  Taking a pharmacetical like Prozac does not make a person "high."  I have a real problem with the way Slater portrays Prozac as her "drug."  She pontificates as if taking an anti-deppressant for DEPPRESSION is shameful, secretive.  Slater becomes an intern at a half-way house for "boozers" and is informed that staff member's sign waivers allowing the administration to do random urine screens.  Athough Slater does not use any illegal drugs, she panics at the thought of "being revealed."  Slater compares herself to the addicts who live at the half-way house.  Describing a client, she says "he stared straight at me, one junkie to another..."     It insulting to those of us who have struggled with addiction to have Slater describe herself as a "junkie" because she is over dramatizing her experience with Prozac.  It was persribed to her for the treatment of a disease and she was NOT abusing the medication.   (I am in recovery and have been clean for 3 years).  Slater later also considers herself "drug-dependent" and tries to convince the reader of her claim with her interpretation of what The DSM IV calls addiction.  I don't buy it, and I don't think anyone who has struggled with drug or alcohol addiction will either.  Maybe a reader without a history of addiction and/or depression won't notice that Slater is a phoney and an alarmist.  Nobody is buying the "addicted to Prozac" crap.         
 Sam's voice is still in decent shape, but this set is just awkward. Star studded album isn't always the best way to cash in on an againg star. The last great album Sam did was over 30 years ago and that's the one you need to get (Plenty Good Lovin': The Lost Solo Album).  I like quite a few stars that appear here, but that's not a good enough reason for me to buy this album. The selection of songs (and guest artists) is just strange, and doesn't work for me. Three star rating for the voice, one for the album = 2  :(  If you're into aging soul star revival, go listen to a phenomenal Solomon Burke's last few albums (especially 2002 Don't Give Up On Me) 
 Jrayne has already covered most of the basics regarding VnV's progression over time.  I would like to echo the sentiment that rather than being a return to form, Judgement is a descent into mediocrity.  Especially considering VnV's past efforts.  Unfortunately this isn't a case of a group moving their music in a new direction that some will like and some won't, parts of this album were just bad; period.  Particularly the ballads.  This seems to happen often in the realm of industrial/ebm/synthpop with groups totally dropping off a cliff (see Hate Dept. re: Ditch), but in the case of a group that gave us so many great albums and songs this was a massive dissapointment.  VnV's older songs have a passion and intensity about them, and many were powerful enough to rip you from whatever else you were doing while listening (reading, playing  agame, etc.) and forced you to listen and hear them.  For me the last VnV song to do this was Beloved.  It has been two albums now... There is no longer passion in their songs, they just drone 
 A few years ago I read "House of Sand and Fog" by this author and thought it was great.  That's why I was anxious to read this earlier novel of his.  From the blurb on the cover I learned it was set in the late 60s, during a time of political turmoil in America.  I therefore thought the author would use his talent to bring us back to a time and place that created major changes in the American landscape.     Well, the story IS about young man's coming of age during this period.  But it never deals with any of the real conflicts that were going on at the time.  Instead it is about his romance with a young woman and family relationships.  And, frankly, some of the people and situations he describes are just not believable.  There's the story of his mother, who died when he was a baby but left behind a diary of her life. The boy's father never got over his grief and his recreational activity is playing guitar and playing poker.  One of his friends teaches the boy to play the harmonica and we all see that this is the boy's calling.  The girl he romances comes from a strange family.  Her father,  a nut-job communist, is a house builder and tries to force Communist ideals down the throats of the men who work for him. Naturally, violence erupts.  This is all supposed to happen in a little Massachusetts town that is so backward that the main characters don't even have a TV.  And this is in 1968!   The Vietnam War is just a backdrop to the story.  I never got a feeling about the real undercurrent of conflict and change that was happening in the country.  Mostly, the story was about a budding love and its consequences.  I was soon bored but I pushed myself to finish the book in hopes it would get better.  It didn't 
 After loving Halloween 2, and it's creepy hospital setting, I was very excited to hear that there were two other hospital-slashers in the early 80's; this and "Hospital Massacre". I hadn't been able to find these two movies until I went to this video store out of town that is known for having a HUGE selection, as well as a lot of hard-to-find movies. I was very pleased to not only find "Visiting Hours" and "Hospital Massacre", but a whole other bunch of scary movies I wanted to see. I got "Sleepaway Camp 2", and then decided to get only one hospital movie; I chose "Visiting Hours" due to the supieror cover art. Well, it's no Halloween 2. In fact, it's not even a slasher movie!; it's purely a drama, laced with thriller/suspense elements. And it's boring, boring, boring...One other problem is that alot of the movie foucuses on the killers personal life. We see him talk and act in his "normal" life. This not only made it more boring, but it made it so the guy wasn't even so scary anymore! The hospital setting is not that creepy even, and the parts in the hospital that are soppoused to be suspensful and scary don't happen till towards the end. Other Notes: "Visiting Hours" was actually based off a book, which is now out of print. And most horror films based off books aren't always all that exciting. This isn't...Lastly, this is a very "mature" kind of horror film; it isn't something you'd watch on Halloween with a group of freinds, and doesn't have the thrills and chills of "Halloween 2" or the fun of the "Friday the 13th" series. And don't be fooled by the cool box art 
 This book tries to cover everything and succeeds at very little.  It covers everything from how to build a smoker from a used refrigerator to recipes.  But.. none of these topics are covered extensively or very well.    The illustrations are weak; the recipes are very weak; and, the general process discussions are haphazardly organized.    I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews, but am very disappointed 
 If this album sounded original I would appreciate it however it sounds like a bunch of throw away songs from an old Prince CD called "Sign O the Times." Look it up. The singing style, music style are all prince sans guitar. At least he didn't steal his dancing style from prince, he got that from Usher, just like the style of his last CD. If it weren't for Timbaland there would be no originality at all on this CD. Really folks this guy's music was better when he was with NSYNC.  
 This book contains a good color wheel and some useful discussion about material, but that's about it.  The art is extremely idiosyncratic, stylized, and modern, and it is not very appealing.  What's more, it appears that the author only has command of one style/genre, and that won't be of much help people who are trying to learn.  Spend your money on The North Light Book of Acrylic Painting Techniques instead 
 This novel is confusing, melodramatic and contains too many improbable developments.  Its main character, Verloc, considers himself as an anarchist, although his role is 'the protection of the social mechanism', because 'protection is the first necessity of opulence and luxury'. As an 'agent provocateur' for a foreign country, he is forced (otherwise he looses his job) to organize a terrorist attack, which should 'waken up the middle classes' against 'unhygienic labour' in Great-Britain. He is also a spy on revolutionary activities of a small club of leftists fanatics (a combination of marxists and anarchists).  Conrad's superlative style is everything except subtle: 'the shallow enviousness of unhygienic labour' and 'the poor, pathetically mendacious, miserably authenticated by the horrible breath of cheap rum and soap-suds', seem to contradict a 'bad world for poor people'. The writing is sloppy. One time, an organization is called the Central Red Committee, another time, the International Red Committee. A 'Central' Committee seems rather bizarre for anarchists ('I depend on death, which knows no restraint and cannot be attacked. My superiority is evident.')  A dialogue between a police chief and a pure anarchist ('looking for the blow to open the first crack in the great edifice of legal conceptions sheltering the atrocious injustice of society') seems improbable, as well as the short love story between Verloc's wife and another anarchist, at the end.  However, certain aspects of the novel are very actual, like the use of 'a weak-minded creature with carefully indoctrinated loyalty and blind docility and devotion', to carry out the fatal terrorist attack. Also actual is the following sentence: 'the existence of secret agents should not be tolerated, as tending to augment the positive dangers of evil'.  This book has not the same high standard as Conrad's masterpieces like 'Hearth of Darkness' and 'Lord Jim'.  Only for Conrad fans 
 I bought this one for my wife specifically because I didn't think she'd use it enough to merit an ipod.  I  may have wasted my money.  How hard would it have been to add even the most basic "a folder on the disk equals a new playlist" level of management?  Or m3u files?  Since she listens in the van with the kids I wanted a way to put both her music and the kids on it altogether but still keep track of whose is whose.  And the plastic scroll wheel in the upper corner, forget it.  You need two hands to use this thing since you can't reach the buttons, the menu and the scroll wheel in the combination that you need.  I will give it points for just being a simple USB flash drive and not making me run special software.  That helps.  And the expansion card is nice.  But, honestly, I would have been better off with a Nano 
 Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned.  I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.  But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't.  By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....  The script is idiot from page one. The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.  But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break.  Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.  Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.  Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????  Want more?  In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???  In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).  First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive. Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.  We have none of that here.  Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.  Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.  But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under "The story ends bad" label. Without any depth.  Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end.  What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the "this is an open-ending" kind of talk!  Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel? Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: "Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!"  Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great. 
 Although Appelbaum's work won the Pulitzer prize & has received generally good reviews, she really has nothing new to offer.  This would not be a problem, however, she presents her work as being groundbreaking.  There are many good works on the Gulag by historians such as Oleg Khlevniuk,Galina Ivanova, and Amir Weiner.  Appelbaum focuses too closely on the intelligentsia, this is a natural occurrence given her reliance on memoirs, and misses or diminishes the experiences of peasants, prisoners of war, and the many national minorities that suffered as a result of relocation, exile, and collectivization.  As a history student, I am also confounded by her insistence that almost nothing is known of the Gulag, which is certainly not true.  George Kennan was writing about it as early as the 1950s, Conquest in the 1960s.  What she may have meant is that it has not captured the attention of American culture in the way that the Holocaust has.  Particularly disturbing are her comparisons of the Nazis/Holocaust and the USSR/Gulag.  The Gulag was truly horrible, but the entire history of the Soviet Union is not representable solely with the image of the Gulag.  As for whether or not the Russian's have come face-to-face with their past, anyone who has spent any length of time in Moscow knows this is also not true.  There are several memorials to the victims of the repression and the only reason that the current memorial in front of Lyublyanka is a modest stone from Solovki is due to the fact that the committee has been unable to decide upon a suitable monument.  The Memorial Society, for instance, maintains a very large archive of persons who were repressed and their family experiences;  their mission is to ensure that the victims are not forgotten.  There are Memorial Society offices throughout Russia and the former territories of the Soviet Union.  Kathleen Smith has written numerous works on their efforts.  Appelbaum's work is commendable, but it would be more useful to read any of the foregoing authors.    
 because it is bullshirt, cashing in on America's eager ignorace like Steyn and Coulter and company. You never went broke underestimating US prejudice and hate.  This book must be taken for what it is, a propaganda sheet of the MacArthyite stripe not worth the paper it was printed on, full of unfounded and fallacious argumentation to please the most ignorant consumer.  A thin volume. Do not waste that hard earned dollar we suffer so much to gain under the horror of bushanomics. Save it for your children's college tuition instead.   Do you really think anyone but television brainwashes kids nowadays? And who owns that? Rupert Murdoch. Do you really think they are awake enough in the classroom to care what the professor is saying? Especially one who challenges them by cartesian methodology to begin to THINK for once, to question, to investigate, to discover truth, to try parallax and other perspectives?  This book dictates. Learning expands. Education draws forth. Save your buck for a good college education.  This book dictates what texts we may read and not read and forbids the most influential philosophers and writers of the twentieth and nineteenth century, including Darwin. Next up: James Joyce for being inscrutable to SHapiro's very limited and uneducated perception. And God forbid he should ever see the New TEstament, as he would immediately declare it verbotten from any college campus for proposing we treat others as we wish to be treated, and to love our enemies and do good to those who harm us, as he finds no profit in peace. 
 I started to read it.  I tried and tried, but in the end I gave it up.  Maybe I don't have the "intellectual equipment" to understand this book, or most of the other fraudulent tripe of that era.  I felt ashamed of myself for a while - until I found this gem in the Penguin edition of Somerset Maugham's "The Summing up" (page 60):  "It is strange that one can ever have admired that prose.  It does not flow.  There is no air in it.  A careful mosaic constructed by someone without great technical skill to decorate the walls of a station dining room.  Pater's attitude towards the life around him, cloistered, faintly supercilious, gentlemanly, donnish in short, repels me.  Art should be appreciated with passion and violence, not with a tepid, deprecating elegance that fears the censoriousness of a common-room.  But Walter Pater was a feeble creature: it is unnecessary to condemn him with intensity."  Alright, I'm a philistine for not enjoying "Marius", but I can take some comfort in being in excellent company. 
 If you are truly approaching a basement refinishing project from a beginners point of view, this book will be of little if any use to you.  Poor illustrations coupled with less than adequate descriptions make it a pure waste of money.   
 I purchased this book after reading previous reviews of a new and cutting edge running style. After reading this, I am very disappointed. There is nothing new here. The running techniques used in this book are the same ones that have been taught and used by top runners for many years. Landing with your foot under your center of gravity, avoiding heel first footstrike, soft knees, high heel kick, fast turnover with short footplant time, avoiding braking action, running smoothly with little vertical motion are all running form pointers that are taught by any good coach. This is a very high price for a book that has very little new information 
 This is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860's narrated by a Civil War deserter.  Within the first few pages, our hero enlists, pilfers letters off battlefield corpses, deserts, is injured in NYC draft riots, ends up in New Bedford, MA and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going.  The book was downhill from there.  Page after page described ice and the crew's interminable struggles to get through.  Getting through the book was nearly as interminable.  The reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him, or really understand him at all.  Thus, his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles.  There are elements of fantasy in the book.  Not enough to make it a fantasy, but enough to steer a reader off course.  The scientist on the mission is after a warm Garden of Eden in the middle of the Arctic.  He is mad or it's fantasy, it is hard to know until the end.  There is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands (the most likeable character in the book) describes how he got his third hand.  From that yarn comes the title "Rope Eater".  The title really has nothing to do with the book, other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain.  Besides the tedious turning of the plot, the characters lack any development.  Only the three handed man and the captain, both tangential characters, had any depth whatsoever.  This book seemed to be an attempt at adventure, but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension.  It never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters - mentally and physically - it just happened.  Although the reader knew the characters must be suffering, it never came through the over-writing.  As one might expect, the crew's mission to find the warm Garden of Eden in the arctic was pointless.  So was this book.  It was a disappointment.  
 Esta novela es a la literatura lo que la planta nuclear de Chernobyl es al medio ambiente 
 You'd expect a book with this title to actually have some neurobiology in it, but you'd be disappointed. This slim volume consists of two diffuse philosophical essays, one about free will, and the other about political power. Both are simplistic, in my view, and don't bring any new ideas to the table. The essay on free will was the most interesting, but despite the book's title, the author doesn't bring in any neurobiology. Instead he basically says that neurobiology should be involved, and possibly quantum mechanical randomness, because that's the only nondeterministic mechanism he can think of that might be related to the nondeterminism of free will. That particular idea is explored much more deeply in Roger Penrose's book "The Emperor's New Mind," which despite its flaws, is a much deeper and more solid book. 
 My suggestion to other readers is - do not waste your time or money on this book! When the big 30 began to approach I ordered the book from Amazon. I couldn't wait to tear into it. Unfortunately, I was very, very disappointed. The best part of this book is the cover, and that's no lie. I ordered this book thinking I would get good information and it would be funny. Instead all I learned was that you can string together pages and pages of drivel. With the constant hysteria about turning 30 in this book, it will make you have a mental breakdown.  The book feeds into this false culture of fear.  Also, the book reads like a college term paper - a bad college term paper 
 Basic in its approach to writing, this book may be useful for high school English classes but is totally unsuitable for college students.  Although it contains some worthwhile fiction, most of the non-fiction pieces are not very challenging for college readers.  The text is extremely prescriptive, and leads students to write formulaic papers rather than original and creative college level essays 
 i think this book sucked because it implys gymnasts are to thin. Well, it's not easy to do a backflip with a big plumpshery tummy flobbing around. YU HAVE TO BE THIN!!! AND GYMNASTS' DIETS ARE NOT ABUSIVE!!! they are only NECESSARY so the Gymnasts don't get all soft and flabby. and Gymnasdtics teaches disiplin, which you dont find in flobby fat people. im a gymnast whos 10 and i cant think of ANYTHING bad about Gymnastics. Huh! 
 Over time (9 months) my aquasana filter developed cracks in both the shower head and filter housing. Customer service told me to buy a new one. I guess it really is 'All about the money'. Pass this loser. Buy a metal body filter 
 This book was alright. Some of the words I couldn't understand. Words like roughing the passer. I believe that if someone has the ball they should know that they are going to get smashed 
 I read all the reviews before I bought this shaver.  There were a couple who didn't like the shaver.  I agree with them.   I think electric shavers should be quiet, shave close, shave fast, shave without irritation, and have some degree of quality.    A close shave is one that you cannot feel stubble when you push your finger against the direction of beard growth.  This shaver did not shave close.  After several weeks of shaving it still burns putting on after-shave.    It takes too much time to shave.    It is fairly quiet.    The battery longevity is average.    Construction quality is average for the price range.    It is rated 2 stars overall.  I will not replace the cutting head when it wears out but will discard the shaver.     
 I bought a Netgear WG311T wireless card to replace one from another manufacturer that had failed.  First, I coudln't get a connection to the router.  Two conversations with tech support in India produced the information that I had to download a new driver for Windows XP-SP2 from the internet.  I installed the new driver, which allowed me to connect to the router, but not reliably to the internet.  A third attempt with tech support produced the suggestion that I change my web browser (I'm using IE!)  Instead, I bought a Linksys card, which worked straight out of the box.  Don't buy this product!  If you're not convinced, go to the Netgear user forum and read the horror stories there 
 Having read and enjoyed the author's young adult book Hoot, and looking for a light adult read, I picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light.  Frankly, it was both of thos things, but within a hundred pages, it became eminently easy to put down.  I enoy a diversion reading book periodically, and have some adult writers that meet those needs, Thomas Perry and Harold Adams to name two.  This one didn't make it for me.  It seemed to be a lot of: given a hurricane, one darn thing after another for a group of characters I didn't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together 
 First of all let me say that the overall mystery was boring and I knew the ending very eraly in the book....nothing new to offer here.  I read a lot of series where you can predict what happens but great characters make is worth the reading.  This isn't one of those books.  The mystery starts in such a contrived way!!  19 years ago a murder of two girls took place in Syracuse.  "Bunny" (our protagonist) is not from Syracuse but happens to live there now because her husband is from there.  She is from Long Island and California old money.  But she happens to be in Syracuse now.  At the same time it happens that she is handed a set of dog tags, from her father-in-law, that were found at the murder site.  The tags also happen to be from her cousin-who does not live in Syracuse but happened to be in town at the same time the murder took place.  How contrived is that?  If "Bunny" wasn't married to his son would the tags remained ignored? Could there be a more contrived connection than the tags belonging to her cousin? It is a poor way to get into a mystery. Anyway, anyone who reads mysteries can guess who did the murder quickly.  The real problem I had was with "Bunny" - the main protagonist. What a distasteful unpleasant character she is.  Her whole "stick" is that she hates Syracuse.  From page one she complains about living in Syracuse and it seems not a page goes by without another complaint about living in Syracuse.  Don't get me wrong..I am from Buffalo and left ASAP - but and here's the thing - my complaints about Buffalo are things that are about me or generic. For example, I hate the winters there or  I wanted to move away from my family. But for a lot of people, Buffalo is the place to live.  I get that - to each their own.  But not "Bunny" - oh no not her.  I have read many many novels where the main character wants to leave their present local - be it the big city, the midwest, the farm, the small town..etc.  But "Bunny's" complaints are so nasty.  She puts down how the people of Syracuse live, what they eat, how they dress, how they spend their money, what music they listen to, etc.  "Bunny" is a spoiled brat, and a condescending snob and I don't want to spend anymore time with her. I only finished the book to see if she grew up....she didn't.   According to the book jacket - the author's life is very similar to "Bunny's" so I can only guess that "Bunny's" words, thoughts, and attitudes are Cornelia Read's.  If that's the case what a poor sad person she is.  One more comment on the book jacket.  There is a blurb from Ken Bruen on the back of the jacket..complimenting the book.  I don't buy it.  Anyone who writes like Ken Bruen can't possible like such a pedestrian mystery -and I know from reading Bruen's Jack Taylor series that Jack reads a lot. And the mystery authors he cites in his novels are not near the same league as this one.  Jack Taylor wouldn't waste his time - I doubt Ken Bruen did either 
 The book grabs the reader with an interesting title then immediately starts off with a look at a boring movie and then reviews of even more boring competing therories. Finally the authors reveal the information ecology therory. Unfortuanately, the don't offer much to back up their view and paint a picture of it being another feel good PC therory. Too bad since they have a valid point that will sadly be lost as another PC mistake.. 
 I ordered the book from them on Nov1. On Nov 15 I called and they told me they didn't have it. The money was returned by Amazon 
 Warning:  This book causes extreme drowsiness.  Do not read while operating motorized vehicles, batheing or cooking.   Do not mix with alcohol 
 This is the story of Sheriff Bell, an insufferable dullard who won't shut up about how criminals these days are really evil (as opposed to all the lovely ones he knew of when growing up?).   He's also a world-class boaster, never going more than a few pages without telling us how fantastic is wife Loretta is. The same Loretta who spends most of her time baking for or writing to evil criminals -- which tells me all I need to know about that marriage.  The yakkity-yakking doesn't stop there. An even bigger gas-bag is Chigurh, the motor-mouthed murderer. In fact, he kills people twice. Before he shoots 'em, he bores 'em to death. His weapon of choice: Lectures about coins. (His final kill took so long, I had to restrain myself from flingling the book across the train carriage.)  On the technical front, McCarthy does not structure the drama in the Classical way. He chose the Boring way. The majority of scenes end exactly as you expect and only one character (Moss) has a believable goal. McCarthy also omits the obligatory final scene, between Chigurh and his prey Moss, which was the only reason I kept reading the book. No doubt this is to defy the expectations of the reader. Expectations that this might turn out to be a decent story, in my case.   What's more, Sheriff Bell has no scenes with either Chigurh or Moss, making him a narrator with zero personal stake in the action. Because McCarthy writes good, visual dialogue, he gets away with an inconsequntial narrator for the first half of the story. But when the man on the run (Moss) exits the story, there is no other character to invest in, so the plot grinds to a halt. McCarthy cannot resusitate it because there is no connection whatever between the two remaining main players.  So, does McCarthy put us out of our misery? No. Sheriff Bell waffles on for pages and pages about Vietnam, not unlike John Goodman's character Walter in the Big Lebowski. And that's it.  My verdict: I hope Loretta runs away with a criminal. Preferably one of them new evil ones 
 I received the CD in a reasonable amount of time but unfortunately the CD was not in A1 shape.  There is a scratch on the CD and one of the songs on the CD skips A LOT which is disappointing.  
 First, I should say that I haven't yet heard any of the Oasis records made after this one. Like most people I got into Oasis (as well as Blur) during the Definitely Maybe/Morning Glory years. When I heard "Be Here Now" I couldn't help wondering if the band had lost its edge. I liked The Master Plan a lot, but as it was more a loose collection of B-sides than an album in its own right, I didn't read it as indicative of a specific musical direction.   By the time I bought a cassette of SOTSOG during an April 2000 trip to the UK, my Britpop tastes had moved on to Stereophonics, Belle & Sebastian and Badly Drawn Boy. I listened to that cassette in my rental car all during the trip. I wasn't crazy about it. I really liked a couple songs, but when I got back to the US I put the tape away and rarely ever listened to it until a few weeks ago.  So, my take on SOTSOG:  Noel Gallagher has always written trite lyrics, but the triteness was forgivable because his songs had great hooks and were loud and noisy and made you want to jump around. SOTSOG shows that when Noel goes mellow, his lyrics quickly go from innocuous to annoying - and these songs generally aren't hooky enough to compensate.   Letting Liam join the songwriting guild was not a smart remedial step; at this stage, Liam's simply a juvenile songwriter. I don't oppose the mellowing of Oasis, but if they are going to turn the noise down they're going to have to ratchet up the hook quotient or come up with some more sophisticated lyrics. Noel's mellow tunes on The Master Plan ("Going Nowhere", "The Masterplan") came closer to achieving this balance.  That said, the album has a few highlights. The Celtic raga-hymn "Who Feels Love" is one of the band's best songs, ever; since the CD-single of this song is more expensive than SOTSOG, the album is worth buying for this one song alone. Also, "Go Let It Out" is pretty much vintage Oasis, bright and crisp.  I like where Noel Gallagher is going. I'm interested to see if Oasis' post-SOTSOG output is better 
 Like all James Patterson's books, this was a good story idea, but poorly executed. Patterson's characters are interesting and his plot lines are clever, but the dialog runs from awkward to silly, and his pacing is often confusing and forced. That's why his books do better as movies: a better writer gets to use Patterson's concepts with more realistic dialog and good pacing 
 This is one of the few books where I can honestly say that the movie was better...  much better.  I was not impressed with Koontz's bad guy who was not very well developed at all.  The world is not so black and white, which makes things far more interesting 
 This is one of the best books I have ever read on the Revolutionary War.  Even though it is technically classified as a novel, it is accurately presented history. Mr. Shaara obviously did a lot of research for this book, and presented the historical events accurately, as well as presenting dialogue in such a way that it was totally believable.  The main participants in the Revolutionary War were presented not as gods, but as truly great and courageous men and women.  He also presented the details of battles, troop movements, condition of troops, and maps of battle locations in such a way that the reader is completely captivated and a vicarious participant in the events.  I have a better understanding of the Revolutionary War years than I have ever had, and would highly recommend this book to every American who would like to have a better understanding of the founding of our wonderful country.  
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I wish I had seen these reviews for this book. It is worthless in terms of information on obtaining funds for small business. If your handicapped or a minority it might be of some use for loans.  Nothing relevent for myself as an individual with no startup capital 
 Kaufmann acknowledges as one of his central aims to introduce Franz Anton Maulbertsch to art historians outside Central Europe, who are, he says, not yet sufficiently aware of his outstanding achievements. A good idea, he thinks, to make him palatable to newcomers is to disperse the aura of 'strangeness' surrounding him - "The present book", he says, "aims to make the apparently strange seem familiar." To me, this seems all wrong - who, e.g., would try to proselytize for Goya by playing down the sheer extravagance of his imagaination and trying, so to speak, to domesticate him? And do believe me, Maulbertsch, in his most visionary moments is in his own peculiar way not far behind Goya, and thus the very thing to do to make his claims to the pantheon of art history truly convincing would be to celebrate Maulbertsch's strangeness and exuberant fancy.  Kaufmann, sadly, has for most of the time a quite different aganda. He focuses on the way Maulbertsch was influenced by enlightenment, the rise of neo-classicism and all the concomitant theories; that is, he 'familiarizes' him by linking him to certain intellectual debates of his times. But unfortunately these were influences that on the whole forced Maulbertsch to rein in his more imaginative sallies und  in many cases - especially in large-scale fresco painting - diluted his artistic capabilities. How a great painter of the 2nd half of the 18th century, trained in the school of late baroque extravaganza, tried to come to terms with the emerging ideas of clarity, sobriety and dignity, makes of course a fascinating story, but as the focus of a beginner's guide to Maulbertsch is does not seem particularly suitable. Art historians conversant with the wider horizons of Central European painting might even point out that some of Maulbertsch's colleagues achieved better results when trying to strike a compromise between Baroque training and the neo-classicist demands of the day. The merits of later Maulbertsch have always been a point of some controversy; his dazzling virtuosity in the early stages of his career has never been seriously doubted by anyone looking into his oeuvre.    To what extent Maulbertsch got involved in late 18th century debates is, by the way, a terrain well trodden over in German language Maulbertsch scholarship. Perhaps it is not surprising that so many scholars have set their hearts on it and that Mr Kaufmann has been eager to join their rank: You can fill quite a lot of pages by going lovingly over all those contemporary theories, programmes and reviews that make up the 'discourse' sourrounding late Maulbertsch (or should I rather say the 'discursive haze'?), whereas it is much harder to untangle the various threads that have gone into creating the unique stylistic bravura of Maulbertsch in his heyday.   Still, you might fo course argue that it is good thing to bring Maulbertsch to the notice of the English speaking world at all; and after all there are lots of illustrations (covering all stages of Maulbertsch's career), some of which might indeed make the reader fall in love with Maulbertsch's strangeness in spite of Mr Kaufmann's attempt to tame and civilize him. Regrettably, quite a few of the pictures are of such staggeringly poor quality that it is hard to understand how they could possibly be compatible with the standards to be expected from a unviersity press; pictures that look as if they had been printed in some East European backwater town of the 1960s. 
 I'm not a literary reviewer or a writer, I'm just a third year Sociology student at the University of Windsor who is being forced to take a statistics course...and forced to use this text. It's bad enough that I have to take the course but, to go and dump on me, probably THE most difficult book in the world to read, is just too much.  The definitions are uncomprehensible, the examples are useless and the explanations are so overly worded you can't even make out what the point is!  On top of all that, the chapters aren't in any type of sensible order and as if all this wasn't enough....the darn thing costs well over $90 (for a book I will never use again!). In sum, the worst possible choice for a statistics course text and a complete waste of money!! 
 Clearly John Gardner is a literary genius, however not being one myself I found that his style was a little overbearing, it does not offer the inspired start to writing fiction that I was looking for.   
 This book waste a page to explain: download speed = file size/bit rate even with ilustration (WOW). The rest of the book has the same technical level. Amazon, dont you check what you sell 
 From time to time I read a book and dislike the heroine so much that I don't even care what happens to her.  In this book, I didn't particularly dislike Susanna but I just flat didn't "get" her.  A man is stalking her so instead of telling Jack, her husband who just happens to be a Texas Ranger, she packs up and moves from Texas to Boston.  Then, even though she proclaims her deep love for her husband she just can't bring herself to return home to him and instead puts down strong roots in Boston at her grandmother's house and even purchases an isolated cabin several hours north of Boston.    Her husband learns of the danger she is in and goes to Boston to be with her and once again she sneaks off from him...this time running to the cabin.  THEN, the woods around the cabin are crawling with bad guys, one of whom is a murderer and is also after her so instead of staying in the cabin where another Texas Ranger is there to keep her safe she decides to go cross-country skiing and surprise, surprise runs into the bad guy who, duh, tries to kill her.  Now there's a surprise!    Okay, call me stupid, but if my husband were a CPA and I had an accounting problem, I probably would ask for his help.  If my husband were a doctor and I had some sort of mystery ailment, I think I would ask for his opinion.  And if my husband were a cop and I had some really bad guys after me, I believe I would see if my husband could help keep me safe!    Like I said, I just didn't GET Susanna. I think Ms. Neggers intended to portray Susanna as being so strong that she didn't need her husband.  Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to understand that being strong sometimes means realizing when you need to turn to someone else for help.  If Jack had been a brain surgeon and Susanna had learned she had a brain tumor, I wonder if she would have insisted on showing how strong she was by operating on herself.  Guess this is a book I won't be keeping. 
 I like travel books that have a sense of adventure, and where one identifies with the writer. This failed on both acounts, and after struggling through half of it a I threw it away. 
 As a proud vet of the Feminist frontlines 1968-1976, I could hardly wait to read her newest book. Her classic book Rubyfruit Jungle was a gem. As THE "coming out" book of it's time I share the sentiment of millions who feel it will always be sacred. However,I was shocked and totally disappointed with Rita Mae Brown's attempt at writing her own story. The person she reveals to us in Rita Will is beyond ego strong. She is ruthlessly self-absorbed and many times cruel.  Everyone (else) is wrong, or less than, or not as smart or not as significant as Rita according to Rita (with the one exception-- her cat.)  The book Rita Will reveals Rita as a sad and shallow person, with high marks only for narcissism.  Best to avoid this book and re-read Rubyfruit Jungle instead. You'll continue to have a positive impression of Ms. Brown if you do 
 Baring the Calphalon name I was expecting something really nice, especially for the price I paid through Amazon of $84.95 - boy was I disappointed. Although Amazon is selling it as high-quality piece the Calphalon Contemporary Stainless 1-1/2-Quart Saucepan with Glass Lid is clearly on the cheaper side of the Calphalon brand. It looks like one of the pans Calphalon gives away to get you to purchase their higher end cookware. The item arrived nicely boxed in the Calphalon box but when I opened the box the pan looked like it had originally been a Return item before it was sent to me - The pot and lid were both in orginal packaging but the lid was clearly broken. It looked like someone had taken a hammer to it and stuck it back in the box and sent it on to me. Amazon has agreed to send a replacement at no charge but I can't believe they would have sent something like this to me to begin with without first inspecting what they send out. Unless it's being given to you as a "freebie" I suggest you save your money. 
 Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous 
 A patchwork of history, fiction and feminist commentary, Sontag's novel falls short in virtually every category.   The title of the book is misleading as well. This was neither the story of a volcano lover nor the narrative of a collector. It was a somewhat fractured portrait of the volcano lover's wives.   Sontag hasn't done an especially good job with character development either. Farting kings, eccentric aristocrats and bloated women jump from the pages as caricatures rather than fully developed characters.   Lord Nelson, a principal figure in the book, is never actually named, but simply referred to as "the hero." A device that falls rather flat in what tends to be a rather tedious read.  As historical fiction, Madison Smartt Bell's Haitian trilogy is far superior to Sontag's novel. And her feminist spin on a bygone era falls considerably short of Michel Faber's "The Crimson Petal and the White."  The 1,500-page-plus trilogy and 800-page-plus Faber novel by the way are quicker, more compelling reads than Sontag's much shorter, but much more boring and disjointed "romance."  Punctuation and the lack of quotation marks would be the very least of my concerns about this particular book. After all, if we can get through Ulysses or Finnegan's Wake, Sontag's fiction by comparison would qualify an easy read. No...there's much more missing here than quotation marks.  
 This book comes with a RECORD!  I haven't had a record player in a decade so the usefulness was limited.  It could be terrific but without a record player I will never know 
 The 2 stars is the average I give to all the fable books written by Patrick.  The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: 5 stars Obviously, it is the best one. (you can see it from the sales record in Amazon). It was the first Patrick's book I read. I have finished reading the whole book in one setting and couldn't wait and jump to look for his other books. The book has a reasonable length, setting up a bit simplified, but not over-simplified, and still reasonable fable-like setting to illustrate all important team dysfunctions and team building skills. The whole book is tight and coherent and an easy but enlightening read. Highly recommended!    Death by Meeting: A Leadership Fable   4 stars It is a good one but not as great as the five team dysfunctions. A very good explanation of all kinds of meetings and how to use each of them. I recommend you buy one, read it and keep it as a reference. One drawback is the author tried to spicy up the book so one of the main characters will occassionally scream out some rude comments if he didn't take his pills. I never work with such an unusual person and  I prefer less dramatic in a management fable. (not something like in "Desperate Housewife", the neighbor besides you was a serial killer and the housewife across the street did her gardener and used her Chinese maid to bear her baby.)  I should have stopped here and never rush to read his other books..   The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive:  2 stars This is the one made me begin to feel betrayed. If the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within weeks. The fable setting needs more polishing works. Although the four obsessions have been presented with reasonable clariy, reading this book makes you feel that the author thinks you are an idiot. Scenarios like how the VP HR plots to damage the trust seem to be more suitable for a toddler fable rather than something for teenagers, not mentioning for managers. The rough plot affects the whole four points--though four very good points. I will recommend you to skim the whole book in less than 20 minutes by standing in a bookstore.    Five temptations of CEO 1 star?  It is the one makes me begin to feel angry. Again, if the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within hours. The major story (95% of the book) happened in a dark train, where a poor CEO was taught about these five temptations by some ghost-like old men, who turned out later to be the previous CEOs in the SAME company! Again the five temptations are all great and worthwhile points. It is the plot that made me sick. If you have a chance, skim the whole book in less than FIVE minutes.   Silos, Politics and Turf Wars      NEGATIVE 1 star The worst one. Negative 1 star is because it wasted my time. I thought the five temptation one was the worst until I read this one.  Patrick spends most of the book to illustrate the silo problems rather than provide any solution. And he even spends many pages about the main character's struggle in balancing his work and his wife's pregnancy, which I believe, should belong to another fable about personal life balance, given how many pages the author devoted to this. From other fables, more or less, you can at least learn something. But not from this one. Forget it! 
 I wonder if Pat mentions his diamond mine in Zaire in his book? The African Development Co., based in Zaire, was established by Robertson during the rule of the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Mobutu was a sadistic, murderous, dictator who kept his country's people in poverty while he becomming one the richest men in the world. In April, 1997 two pilots who worked for Operation Blessing, Robertson's African relief organization, charged that planes linked to Robertson and his ministry flew mostly to haul equipment for ADC's private diamond operation. Robert Hinkle, the chief pilot told reporter Bill Sizemore that of about 40 flights within Zaire during the half-year period he was there, "Only one or at most two" were related to the humanitarian mission of Operation Blessing. The rest were "mining-related." So much for humanitarian aid given by Robertson's followers to relieve African hunger.   Man of God? More like man of money. Robertson is merely another snake-oil selling scumb@g bilking his "flock" for personal enrichment. Mobutu Sese Seco is not the only brutal dicator Robby is/was pals with. Others include Jorge Serrano, former dictator of Guatemala, and Frederick Chiluba, the ruler of Zambia who brutally enforced christianity as Zambia's state religion despite sizable minorities of other religious beliefs. And let's not forget Robertson's gold mine in Liberia and his friendship with now owsted president Charles Taylor, a warlord blamed for torture, killings, forced labor, and extortion. Taylor is a partial bankroller of al-Qaeda and was indicted by a U.N. war crimes tribunal for arming Sierra Leoneon rebels who specialize in mass rape and in hacking off the limbs of civilians including many children below the age of 12. He's one of Pat's special friends who he supports to this day. I'm not going to go so far as to say Pat is the antichrist, but he sure meets a lot of the criteria 
 I really tried to like this game, being that EA chickened out and bought their way out of competition.  The graphics and sound are great in this game, but its ruined by EA's cheating AI. I have never seen a game cheat this much in my life. No matter what play you call the defense always knows what you are calling, even if you think you have them beat on a play, your receiver will purposely drop a wide open pass or better yet the defender turns on his nitrous oxide that was installed in his uniform and cover half the field in 2 seconds to deflect a pass. If you throw a high pass, not to worry the lineman has installed jet packs which allows them to jump 10 feet in the air and deflect or pick off your pass. If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose no matter what you do.   If you QB is going back for a pass and a lineman is 3 feet away from you, even if you press the passing button, your QB will just stand there so he can take a sack. This game is total BS, there is no way to get off passes in heavy pressure becuase the game forces you into a tackle animation.   When you are playing defense, you are better off putting down your controller and clipping your nails or flossing your teeth while the CPU pulls of BS miracle plays on every single down. Remember how I said your receivers will purposely drop wide open passes? Not the CPU receivers, the CPU receivers, regardless of their rating can catch passes in double and triple coverage every time. if they don't catch it, the ball just gets tipped over and over again until he can catch it. Think you stopped a 3rd down conversion? Think again, you will get flagged for pass interference or a face mask penatly. And remember about your QB being forced into a tackle animation? Not the CPU, the CPU can get of 60 yard spirals while he's being hit!   What about the inconsistency you ask? Well let me explain. How is it that one game you can be totally on, but the next game, you can't even complete ONE pass! I'll tell you why. The CPU wants you to lose, so you will drop every pass, fumble every run and get called for every penalty in the book. I was playing a game, and managed to run back a punt and KR for a TD, before my offense even touched the field. Then all of a sudden the CPU turned on its God Mode and every thing went right for the CPU. BS lobs, BS runs and BS calls. I did not complete ONE SINGLE pass in the entire first half. Its not because the CPU was playing good defense, its because my receivers dropped every ball that was thrown to them, wide open or not. I ended up only completing one pass in the entire game, 1 for 20 I think. At this point, I knew I had no chance of winning, so I just started punting the ball on first down to avoid any more frustration. My so called impact RB only got 2 yards on 20 rushes, and my so called impact CB gave up 3 TD passes to a below average receiver. What is the point of playing if you are not even given a chance to win?   Yes you can win games as I have, but it is so inconsistent. If the CPU wants you to lose you will lose, nothing you can do about it.  I see why EA bought the license, after putting out crap like this, they were sure to lose a lot of customers to a game that knows how to develop better AI, instead of this cheating crap. I am taking this game to the store for store credit and I am done with EA for good. EA sucks and so does this game 
 It does not allow paid customer to read it in another computer or print a hard copy. To be exact, it allows paid customer to print 5 pages every 28 days. The book has more than 300 pages, so go figure how long it takes to print your book. The purpose of buying a manual is to learn to use the software while reading it. How do you expect your customer to use the software when he is reading the book on the same computer? And this is hurting the eyes! This is damaging Amazon's reputation too 
 This book was not what I expected.  Every chapter was full of references to other books, in particular his 1st book 
 Don't bother wasting your money if you think you are upgrading like I did.   The earlier ARTISAN release is still much better than this special edition.   The image is better and ALSO the sound.   I don't know what Lions gate thought they were doing, but remastered? no.   I compared both several times before writing this even though I only had to compare once.   Might as well wait for a HD DVD to come out, this is a waste unless you want the additional features 
 This book is useless to those who dont understand algebra. I tried to learn some of the concepts just by reading and found myself nodding out.  What irritated me the most was the author was "kind" enough to offer to sell you an excel spreadsheet program to figure out all his calculations...........at $195.00 each commodity! And another $29.00 for the historical data. Seems like an infomercial to me. I mean if you cant use the book by itself, why not just sell it as a course with everything included. Not to say his methods do not work but it just turned my off.  I am currently working on several trading methodolgies requiring programming knowldge and if anyone can help me with this, we can bypass all this other stuff. Contact me at:mince38 @ yahoo.com   I al also putting together a global think tank of trading ideas of cutting edge thinkers all over the world.  Mar 
 Traditionally and historically proven, novels of offsprings of passionate, vibrant, exciting, reckless, exhilirating, and dangerous characters whom became their parents never 'measure up'.  Allora and Brett, even though  they lived in as dangerous a time as Brett's parents, the excitement,  passion, sensuality, and even the fierce battles  paled in comparison to  Fallon and Alaric, Brett's parents in 'Princess of Fire' 
 I love the "smoky" piano bar sound of this album.  I picture my best girl having a couple of pops late at nigh 
 I don't really care whether the book is "true" or not--although I doubt it is.  But despite a few well written sentences here and there, the stories are boring, the characters unsympathetic, and the setting mundane.  I'm not sure what all the hubbub is about.  There are tons of better books out there.  I don't recommend this one 
 I found this book rather boring. I thought the biginning was hard to get into. There were some unnessacary discriptions that just seemed to add on to the pages in the book. I noticed I was daydreaming numerous times, which was a sign I wasn't into it. Near the end of the book it got a little more fascinating. I enjoyed some ending scenes that had a little more action. Overall, it was an O.K. book. I wasn't overally thrilled 
 I currently have two feeders in the back yard for the hummingbirds.  I love the way this one looks but the birds don't feed from it and I'm not sure why.  The other one will be empty and they still don't come to this one 
 I ordered this magazine a year ago, and my nephew still haven't receive a single magazine!  Every time I email customer service they would tell me that it's coming next month.  I will let you how the magazine is when I get it, but don't hold your breath.  
 I usually really like Anne Tyler (and I do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real, but not necessarily likeable) but this was my least favorite book I've read by her.  I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth.  In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing.  To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing.  I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level.  There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one 
 Although this book may have some good overall general stretches in it it does not cover all the methods of stretching, or any routines for the athlete to build apon.  Although passive stretching is good for your flexability maintanence if you dont incorperate isometric and combining it (PNF), you will never achieve the greatest rang of flexability as a top athlete.  I have been studying the martial arts for 19 years now and I am always looking for good material for stretching to recomend to my students of friends.  I can say I would never recomend this book to another living soul involved in any demanding sport 
 I was fairly interested in this Bible but could not find any details on just what Pink, Hypercolor and Turleback was all about.  Also that it came with a slipcover but showed this Bible in Blue, Green, and Pink.  It would be helpful if an explanation of how it was different, other than in just color and how you could get something other than pink 
 I first became aware of Kelly Wearstler by reading a few articles in decorating magazines. When her first book came out, I recognized her name immediately when I saw the book in the bookstore (which is amazing because I can't even remember what brand of toothpaste I buy at the grocery store). I really enjoyed her first book, and I continue to look through it for ideas/inspiration, but I found this book to be very disappointing. If I had looked at this book before ordering it from Amazon, I would have saved my money. This book covers the range from OK to hilarious. After reading the section called the "Boys' Vestibule," I didn't know whether to laugh because it is so ridiculous or to cry for those little boys that have to live in that house.  The pictures of Ms. Wearstler in all the evening gowns were nice, but what do they have to do with interior design? Two other things passed through my mind as I "read" the book(except for titles there is no text): first, how long does it take to dust all the clutter in that house, and second, her hips must only be about 30 inches. She may look good in huge ballgowns, but I don't think a bikini would be so flattering to those bony hips.  Now, you know that if that's what I'm thinking about as I look at the book, there is something very wrong with this decorating book.  Borrow it from the library 
 I wish I could write a review espousing the merits of this movie which I'm sure it probably deserves due to the subject matter and caliber of the cast... but I can't. Before you order this, you may want do some research to confirm if this latest DVD version is "Region 1" playable. I'm returning the one I've just ordered.  I've read some of the reviews listed on Amazon written by "U.S. reviewers" dated after the release (February 15, 2005) of this "merchant ivory collection" version of this movie and wonder... are the reviews based upon this dvd or just the movie itself?  Anyways... if you order it and can't play it (Region 1 DVD player)... you're not alone 
 This intercooler WILL ruin your 360 with prolonged use. I was getting Error 68 codes and couldn't figure out why. Turns out it was the Intercooler sucking too much power from the 360. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT 
 THIS BOOK IS ONLY FOR THOSE WHO KNOW AYN RAND AND ARE HUNGRY FOR EVERY WORD SHE HAS WRITTEN. FOR THOSE NEW TO AYN RAND, STAY AWAY - CHOOSE ONE OF HER MORE FAMOUS AND POPULAR NOVELS. MOST OF THE WRITING IN THIS BOOK IS  AMATEURISH AND EMBARASSING TO READ - EVEN FOR ME, A STUDENT OF HER  PHILOSOPHY. HOWEVER, EVEN IN THESE POORLY WRITTEN PIECES, MISS RAND'S  PHILOSOPHY AND STYLE ARE VISIBLE.  THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECT OF THESE  SHORT STORIES, PLAYS AND PIECES IS TO SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF MISS RAND'S  WRITING - FROM POOR GRAMMER, SENTENCE STYLE AND STRUCTURE ( THAT OF A  FOREIGNER WITH NO COMMAND OF THE LANGUAGE) TO THE WRITINGS OF SOMEONE WHO  HAS GREAT TALENT AND IS DESTINED TO BECOME A BEST-SELLING AUTHOR.          THUS, IF YOU ARE NEW TO AYN RAND, READ ONE OF HER MAJOR WORKS!! 
 Sorry.  Having collected over 500 cookbooks, and reading them from cover to cover, I think that this book has failed.  Mr Tower in his first book had several recipes that became instant "in-house-make-and-shine" dishes that were not only incredible, but simple, taste knock-outs and interesting.  This book, in my opinion, has eliminated the very people that are buying this book:  the home cook.  There is a great interest in many diverse ingredients that we can cook with.  But the items we have in our pantry or available at most markets seem to be very elusive in this book.  I love/loved Mr. Towers first book; it is one of my top five of all time, but, this book is inflated and overdone, with very little interest to me

 Out of 36 songs in this collection, only 3 are original recordings. The rest are new studio recordings - aka: Garbage! Don't waste your money on this junk! What a disappointment 
 Why would you use this item when any type of ball works?  Tennis balls are my choice, and they can even be spritzed with some fragrance 
 I was looking forward to listening to a remastered version of "Scumbag" but it looks like it isn't going to happen. This is like removing the Apple Jam Cd from All Things Must Pass 
 While there has never been a completely factual account of the life of Wyatt Earp ("Tombstone" comes the closest), this film is completely fictional. First, Wyatt isn't even married in this version, and he becomes enamored with a woman named Clementine; thus the title. Doc Holliday was a dentist, but in this film, he is a surgeon who operates on a wounded bargirl he loves.  As a piece of Western Fiction, this film would be alright, but since it was decided to use the names Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and the OK Corral, the entire project is distracting. The only accurate facts in this film, are that there was a Wyatt Earp, a Doc Holliday and an OK Corral. If it wasn't for the excellent performances of Henry Fonda, and especially, Walter Brennen, I would have given this film one star 
 After reading all the good reviews on this book I decided it must be worth reading.  While I agree that there are alot of problems with watching television the arguements he gave were insane.  Half of the book didn't appear to have anything to do with television.  He blames things such as people commiting crimes and mental health problems to watching television.  He also said something about people substituting telelvision light for real, natural light.  He also talks about evolution and, as a christian, I don't buy into that and don't want to read a book that teaches that as a fact.  It's definately a book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone 
 This book has been, unfortunately, my first introduction to numerical analysis. I wish that I could have chosen a superior book myself, but this is the one prescribed by the university I attend.   The examples in this book are mostly short and insufficient, especially when they are most needed. The lack of good examples wouldn't be so much of a problem, however, if the text itself were better. Unfortunately, many topics are poorly explained. The notation used in this book is often awkward and confusing.   I'm used reading math textbooks and understanding them. Unfortunately, Numerical Analysis by Burden and Faires expects the reader to understand concepts that aren't even fully explained in the text. Avoid if you can 
 This nightmare was so disappointing! It was hard to assemble, and the instructions were minimal and illegible. It is an overpriced piece of junk. In addition, the net for the hoop was not in the box, and the hoop was put on backwards. My son was so upset. I would think this company would be able to produce a product that would be functional, with proper communication, and some info how to contact them if there was a problem, because there will definitely be a problem! 
 I absolutely LOVED "Batman Begins" on the big screen, all three times! I was looking forward to reading the book to exeperience the thrill and excitement of Chris Nolan's masterful rebirth of the Dark Knight on the big screen. Apparently O'Neil forgot about Frank Miller's contribution to the Batman legend.  Unfortunately, Dennis O'Neil's novelization of the book kept me from reliving one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've been a huge Batman junkee since I was a kid, and that is the only reason I finished the book.   The book yields nothing of the pain and fury of what is seen on the screen as the transformation of Bruce Wayne into Batman takes places. You don't not get the demonic sense of a man walking the line between vengeance and justice that Nolan created.   Too much fluff, not enough depth, and absolutely no flow. In fact, O'neil leaves out one of the best scenes in the movie when Batman screams at Flass "SWEAR TO ME." That scene alone captures the anger and fury of the character.  A disappointing read. Its too bad Greg Rucka wasn't allowed to write the book. "No Man's Land" proved he knew how to capture the essence of the character, and convey desperation of a dire situation to the reader. 
 Katz's "Dogs of Bedlam Farm" is a litany of Katz's inadequacies as a man and as a dog trainer.  Katz doesn't love dogs (he admits that he dislikes going to places where dogs and people interact, like dog shows, agility or herding trials), he loves HIS dogs.  He loves them so much that he buys them a farm in upstate NY and stocks it with 16 sheep.  Sheep which he constantly whines about having to care for during a bitter NY winter.  He just has to have 16 sheep, five wouldn't be enough apparently, even though they'd be much easier to care for than 16.  Dogs which he loves so much that he lives apart from his wife.  A wife that he SAYS he loves - but apparently not as much as HIS dogs.  If you're getting the idea that I believe that Katz loves his dogs as possessions, you'd be correct.  And, of course, as a source of income as he writes books about them.  And although Katz fails to train two out of three of his Border Collies, so much so, in fact, that he has to give one of his beloved failures away because he thinks he treats the dog as his father treated him. After two failures and although the third dog pretty much trains herself, Katz glories in being known as the local "dog man". As someone who has owned, trained and exhibited dogs for over 50 years, I see little to recommend in this book.   
  Adam Rapp, 33 Snowfish (Candlewick, 2003)  There should be a warning label on novels written in dialogue, or at the very least a glossary a la A Clockwork Orange at the back. While Rapp's protagonists here speak in somewhat recognizable English, a good deal of what they say simply makes no sense, and the slang they're using is never explained. This leads very quickly to an unreadable book.  In it three teens-- Boobie, Curl, and Custis-- are on a trip. Where? They don't know. They plan to raise some money by selling Boobie's infant brother, whom they've kidnapped and taken with them.  The seeds of something that could have been brilliant. For all the book's unreadability, the characters are well-drawn and mostly distinct, with appealing quirks and depths of amorality rarely found in adult novels, much less stuff penned for the teen set. I'm fond (too much so, perhaps) of depravity for the sake of depravity, but Rapp has written the book so that the reader is forced to sift through acres of slang terms to get to the point, which obviously dilutes the very point he's trying to make (not to mention the imagery associated with it); a hard read for all the wrong reasons. Not worth your time. (zero 
 I bought this book and ended up returning it.  I was unimpressed by the quantity of stones used and felt that it was not well written.  I have all  of Melody's other Love Is In The Earth books and am very impressed by them  but this one was not worth the money.  I have a few other books that are  much better written.  Thanks for listening 
 The description doesnt mention it, but the weights are sand filled bags. When using all 5 of them  at the same time the weight is very bulky and uncomfortable. 
 I was really disappointed with this book. I did not like the illustrations or story line. My son never had an interest in this one either. With so many great other choices for pop up books, I would recommend thye Chuck Murphy pop up series, those really held my son's interest 
 Most people seem to like the soundtrack from"Glory",but this fact does not necessarily make"Glory"a great,or even good soundtrack...Most people also like the food served atMacdonald's,but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers...It is something to put in one's mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungry...The same might be said regarding"Glory"...If one's tastes run to choir music,almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found here...As for the themes,they are commonplace variations,often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer,or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores,so,all in all,the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap,"homestyle"diner...The film,on the other hand,was well done,and,apparently,from reading many of the other reviews here,the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself,rather than very much stand-alone praise for the score.Horner has written a lot of really,really beautiful and original scores,but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or little-noticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatness...So,in sum,we are left with a very popular film,provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer 
 Maps are good, that's all. After 1 year in south america with both Footprint SA and South america on a shoestring, I can say the first one in much better (exept the maps). Not updated, the informations are not really useful...If you want to travel and to be just with gringos, buy this guide. 
 I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT! Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter! WE KNOW! Don't tell us 100 times! This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing. Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work? Also, is it cold stone sober? Or STONE COLD SOBER? (it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?  I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable! I first excused it due to the death of her son.. But her talent never picked up again. From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff. If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially. If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs.. 
 I have heard that this story condones killing anyone that does not want to be converted to Christianity, or at least the video game 'Left Behind' does. This kind of stuff is not Christianity. This is not what Jesus did to those that were not interested in him 'converting' them- he forgave everyone and loved everyone unconditionally 
 today i have not received this book yet.could you inform me when this book would be delivered, please 
 I so enjoyed this series and couldn't wait to get to the next book.  I read all of them in order and was so pleased to find a series and heroine I was really excited about.  What a let down.  However, I persevered, read this book and went all the way to Cerulean Sins.  Now, I understand the negative reviews and other remarks by disappointed readers and fans.  I do not mind sexual influence when it adds to the story, character, whatever.  But, this is down right ridiculous.  I mean, give me a break here.   It was one reviewers opinion that the author refuses to listen to her fans opinions, I hope that is not the case and the plots get back on track and off the current story lines. Because I miss the original Anita and her stories 
 Well, I guess I'm in the minority here, but following to the letter its instructions (for the 4 cup Brikka), the coffee always seems to boil in the top chamber, no matter how low a flame I use or how quickly I get it off the stove when coffee starts coming out the top.  If you like strong, burnt tasting coffee, this is the machine for you. I wanted to like the Brikka, but for under 30 bucks, try an Aerobie Aeropress  (recently got one and I love it) and compare espresso results.  For a great cup of strong coffee, it's very hard to beat the french press 
 While an interesting light read, these 'laws' are not immutable. Nor would your business be in peril if you ignored them, as the authors suggest.  In general, these laws are only for those obsessed with being number one. People going for those few #1 slots would find this book useless. For everyone else, there are a few small pearls to be gathered, but digging through the muck to find them makes them difficult to spot 
 I was excited to recieve this Book when I ordered it. But I was Disappointed in it's Content. The Author Rambles a lot about her Animals (I love animals too) especially her Cats & her Deceased & Living Relatives & Farm. None of which is interesting enough to write about. There is some information in her Book that is Good. But, nothing that I haven't read before. The Same info in this Book has been written by Sylvia Browne & others with more Detail, more Focus & Better, Clearer Writing Skills, that don't go off rambling about un-important things. I'd Skip this one. 
 Very simply put, the sound is wonderful - the design stinks.  I too crazy glued the rubber earcups to the plastic earphones - that lasted 2 days and they fell off.  I don't know what Bose is thinking - clearly they are not doing any end-user testing.  Update - Bose has issued replacement earcups which apparently don't fall off.  Pretty cool - I gotta upgrade my rating from 2 to  
 Hurrah for "sustainability" and "biodiversity"! Down with the human race 
 It was a scandal that I paid good money for this book. This is why people are so against urban fiction. I even read the whole book to give it a chance because that is only fair but come on now people. This book was garbage,the funny thing is it really had a good plot that just never materialized 
 Ok so, so i ordered this thing on the 10th and it just arived today (19th) nine days later, of course the last day of there so called "Delivery Estimate" . The package came from walnut california, i live in humbolt county california, i can dive there in 9 hours  9 HOURS!  and on another note the thing doesnt want to work i plugged it in my wall and my i pod shuts off, ok cool it finaly starts to work and i unplug it freezes for a second then... shuts off its not somthing i want to trust with my $300 i pod  dont buy this thing please you think oooo 2 bucks for a wall charger youll be thinking oooo when it frys, electrocuting you instantly putting you in a coma for the next 20 years of your life  people you get what you pay for  love, joshua   
 Waste and Want is a book in the same way that 10,000 pennies are $100.  Technically it is correct.  But it is less useful and more tedious than one would like.  Ms. Strasser has assembled this book like an old time ransom note.  But instead of using words cut out from magazines, she used 568 citiations.        A ransom note is short, direct and to the point.  Waste and Want cannot be accused of these traits.  Most of the quotes appear to come from old household manuals, for example, the 1835 edition of The American Frugal Housewife.  (Imagine some future historian expounding on the 21st centry american household using Martha Stewart as her main source.)       The book is massively, stunningly unreadable.    If your opinion is that all waste is evil, you might be able to stomach it.  But otherwise read Rubbish by William Rathje - much more enjoyable and educational 
 I bought a paperback copy of Unexplained Mysteries of World War II, at, of all places, the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. I am a World War II buff and it looked like an interesting and somewhat offbeat read. It was that, and in general I enjoyed the book until I became aware of numerous factual errors and numerous instances of what appear to me to be copying from other sources.  The most grievous factual error was on page 160 in the People Who Vanished section, dealing with the B-24 bomber Lady Be Good. The story says that other than a few bits and pieces of clothing, etc., nothing was ever found of the crew. This is incorrect, and could have been verified with even some casual research in the library or on the Internet. In fact, all but one of the nine crewmember's bodies have been found and recovered. This is set out in great detail in the book, The Lady Be Good - Mystery Bomber of World War II, by Dennis E. McClendon. It was published in 1962 and updated in 1982 when new information about the Lady Be Good's final mission was discovered. Diaries recovered from two of the crewmembers gave stark details of their doomed but determined trek north to try and escape the limitless desert.  On page 174 in the People Who Vanished section, the book stated that the U.S. Navy was unable to explain why Flight 19 vanished, despite an exhaustive investigation. In actual fact, the Navy's 1946 report lists a number of Facts, Opinions and Conclusions based on multiple sources of evidence.   More than a dozen specific factors were cited that led to the loss, the changing of any one of which would have resulted in a different outcome: the failure of Lt. Taylor's compass; Lt. Taylor's unfamiliarity with the area; the fact that none of the airplanes had an operable/accurate clock; bad radio reception; delays in sending out rescue airplanes; inability to obtain a prompt RDF fix on the flight to help guide it home; the onset of night, which meant the pilots were ditching at sea in the most hazardous conditions imaginable; failure of the teletype system to keep shore stations apprised of the situation, etc. A good summary of the information can be found in The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved, by Larry Kusche, first printed in 1986 and updated in 1995. The Navy is not mystified about what happened to Flight 19 - they screwed up, got lost, and died.  On page 166 of the People Who Vanished section is told the discovery of the ship Rubicon adrift in the Florida Straits in 1944, her crew nowhere to be found. While newspaper stories at the time hinted that something odd, the final paragraph of the New York Times story about the incident indicates that the ship was moored in Havana and the lines may have given way during hurricane-force winds, blowing the ship out to sea sans crew. Again, see The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved, by Larry Kusche. This is another non-mystery that is shown as such by examining all the facts.  On page 28 of the Puzzling Events section, the advertisement for the game The Deadly Double that ran in The New Yorker just a few weeks before the Pearl Harbor attack is discussed, and it is stated that an unknown person who did not identify himself placed the ad - and that the man later met a violent end. In fact, the couple that placed the ad, Mr. and Mrs. Roger Craig, were interviewed by the FBI and completely cleared of anything other than being involved in a rather odd coincidence. The incident was discussed in some detail in The Broken Seal, by Ladislas Farago, first published in 1967.  My final comment is in regards to pages 58-59 in the Odd Coincidences section, A Couple of Mixed-Up Britons and A Postcard with a Unique View, and page 177 of the Peculiar Premonitions section, Churchill's Sudden Impulse. While I realize that all of these incidents drew from some of the same sources, it strikes me as odd that they bear a striking resemblance to the way the same incidents are described in Mysteries of the Unexplained, Reader's Digest Association, published in 1982. 
 The awfully titled "Food of Love" was Catalonian director's Ventura Pons first English-language film, adapted from a not very good book ("The Page Turner") by American David Leavitt.  The result, I regret to say, was Pons' worst film to date.    The story concerns an 18-year-old aspiring gay pianist, his recently-separated mother and an older pianist with whom he has his first gay sexual relationship during his summer vacation in Barcelona (with his mother).  However, this is not a "coming out" film; all the problems are generated by the mother's feeling due to her divorce and, especially, the intergenerational conflicts between the two leading men.  (Sex is fairly tame too, and the nudity consists of shots of the young man from behind.)  Unfortunately, the movie is poorly scripted (the lines of dialogue are quite laughable at crucial moments) and, worst of all, badly acted.  Kevin Bishop, who plays Paul, the young man at the center of the story, gives a really terrible performance.  He is cute, though (the blonde, blue-eyed boy type), which may explain why he gets compliments in other reviews and even by David Leavitt (in the interview he gives on the DVD).  I'm sure if he were ugly everyone would comment right away on his bad performance. Paul is not a very likable (save physically) or believable character, either. (He also doesnt seem to be having much fun in his sexual relationships and he really mistreats his mother... and she lets him get away with it.)  The other male leads give bad performances as well, with zero nuances or depth.  To be fair, their dialogue is pretty bad to begin with.   The film's only saving grace is the great Juliet Stevenson, who is truly wasted in the poorly written (and cliched) role of the mother who is clueless about her sons (and his lovers) sexual orientation.  Still, Stevenson is such a talented(and funny) actress that she manages to make you care about the character by the end.    I recommend you skip this and rent any other of Ventura Pons' films.  He's an interesting director (hence I checked out this movie) but this film was a misfire from beginning to end.  
 but this still would not make up for the disarray this book is in.  The author has a lot of interesting information, but "Tomorrow's Energy" (TE) is very poorly compiled and editted, making it very difficult to read or skim through. I have another book I would recommend in place of this one, but I will hold off until the end of this review because TE should be fully addressed.  There is almost no foresight in this book. TE reads almost like hydrogen is just a fuel of the past when in fact many of us hope and expect it will one day be our fuel of choice. Even in the last chapter, "The Next 100 Years," the author just continues quoting away and giving speculation by others instead of reflecting on where hydrogen is going to go from his expertise (his perspective would have been nice since he has obviously done a lot of research on the topic).  The book reads like a collection of essays by the author on historical bits about hydrogen. Instead of telling us who did what on what date and here is what the person who did it had to say, it would have been far more useful to have the author explain in his own words what is going on and break the book into smaller sections if necessary (which really is necessary since there are so many random discussions it is painful).  Also, as "Slezak" mentioned, the units (GJ, BTU's, calories, you name it, it's in here) are flip-flopped throughout the book, making it incredibly difficult to follow the numbers, which is really relavent information to this topic.  The only type of person who will find TE useful over the book below is someone who wants to know a lot of details about the history of hydrogen and less about whether it will be useful for us in the future.  Now, my recommendation...  "The Hype about Hydrogen" (THAH), by Joseph Romm  THAH is still a little dry, but it does magnitudes better than TE, and it is consistent with units and has pretty clear descriptions. I couldn't put THAH down (I finished it in less than 2 days*), but after getting into TE about 100 pages, I dreaded going back to it. I made myself finish TE because I looked forward to what I expected to be the forward thinking last chapter (which, as mentioned above, was a great disappointment). *I'm a diligent (slow) reader 
 As a South African acquaintance said to me... "I've never been able to finish a Gordimer book". I decided I would finish this book, and it is well written if in an archingly intellectual manner. But its tough  going...too detached, and ultimately not enough to keep you wanting to go  back. I chose it at random since I had heard so much about Nadine Gordimer,  but had never read any of her work.  Suggest finding another one 
 "Something to Declare" is a clever title for a book about travel abroad; but, beyond its opening pages, that's not what this book is about. "Essays on France" is an equally misleading subtitle, for the book's erudite essays (beyond the opening chapter) are not on France but on a narrow selection of French writers and related movers and shakers, and one fictional character: Madame Bovary. After a fast-paced, dazzling opening sequence, hilariously describing the teen-aged Barnes' first encounters across the English Channel, we slow down to pick through some highlights in the lives of some of the top French authors, poets, filmmakers and other cultural icons, eventually easing to a crawl through exhaustive detail regarding the author's main interest, Flaubert and his world. If Madame Bovary is your cup of tea, you may enjoy steeping yourself further in Barnes. For me it was just too much 
 This movie is so bad, it barely deserves mention. However, I am a big DL fan, and I am writing this in the hope that Dolph will not abandon his fans---he may be making movies like this just for the $$, but, I believe, he is also doing irreparable damage to his career 
 I guess this book would be better appreciated by those who actually believe in magic, protection spells and things like that. The book does offer it's fair share of information to those who are just interested in monsters generally, but there are far more better books for that kind of research.  The book has chapters for ghosts, demons, angels, werewolves, vampires and other things that go bump in the night. Greer has included sightings and legends from the history, but I always found myself wanting more details. Most portions of the book are about monsters generally and they also offer magical means to defend oneself from monsters. If you are not interested in magic and spells, the book offers only a brief glance into the monster lore.  I was somewhat disappointed in the book, it had only a few interesting bits and pieces of information. Most of the times I found myself reading about Greer's own theories, which I am sorry to say, didn't seem too convincing. If you are offering an example from the history or news, you should include more information about it, otherwise the example has no real use.  If you are interested magic and it's involvement with monsters, this might be the book for you. If you want to really read about monsters, I recommend you find other books for your reading pleasure 
 This was the first Ludlum book I have read.  I bought several and now am thinking I've wasted my money.  He took a realistic story and destroyed it with an unbelievable plot.  All the bad guys, who have so much power that they can have anyone in the world killed within 24 hours of the victim hearing about the Secret Plot to control the World cannot even protect their top masterminds from being kidnapped by a New York lawyer, his consultant ex-wife, and a couple of low-level military officers.  Then, each bad guy willingly spills everything about the Secret Plot merely upon learning that one of his colleagues has insulted him?  Give me a break.  Don't even get me started on how unrealistic the relationship is b/w the main character and his ex-wife.  Give the book as a gift to your 12 year old nieces and nephews, but don't waste your time or money on this if you are over 12 years old 
 For years I have avoided Jodi Picoult novels and if this one is typical, with good reason.  For my book club, I am plowing through the nauseating minuate that bulks this novel to over 400 pages.  The constant, brief shifts in first-person narration are too fast and give views on characters, such as a judge who likes show tunes, that are irrelevant to the novel at the expense of more fully developing the title character.  The first-person narration works for important characters but otherwise I think the author is using an easy narrative device to propel the action of her novel, which is, even with this technique, infuriatingly slow and has the effect of jarring the reader every page or two as one must determine the narrator yet again.    Also, the focus on the child-custody battle removes attention from who I think is the most interesting character--the child Faith.  If one can get past the didactic symbolism of the name Faith White, and the constant phrasing such as "here is a story about faith" (p. 275) followed by "he'll do whatever is in his power to make sure I keep Faith," (p.291), which makes me cringe at each repetition, the child seeing or hearing God is, to me, the most interesting aspect of the plot but one that receives little attention.    Overall, I think this novel is heavy-handed, overly descriptive and replete with such obvious symbolism and detail it makes my eyes hurt. The characters never seem real and I never sympathize with any of their easily predictable reactions and emotions, but find the potential of the plot is never fully realized in any engaging way. Try a different novel- many others dealing with religion exist that are far better written and much more interesting 
 The whole book just meandered from the get-go, never going anywhere.  One could surmise early who would be killed and who the killer would be, but the murder was certainly an afterthought.  I'm also tired of Qwill's relationship with the boring Polly.  And the great number of times he mentions his mustache.  A great disappointment!  -- Pa 
 this book was written so badley, and became so on going that, I could bearly stand reading i 
 I'm a big fan of Outlaw and Texas Country, however, still album was not for me.  Hank III is too raw, too basic, and too lacking for me.  However, he does have a very unique sound and style and I can't think of anyone else out there that he sounds like.  Still I'd be cautious about buy this CD and listen to the song samples that Amazon provides 
 Kellerman's last few books have been forgettable to say the least and I hoped that this would display the quality of his early writing.  While it was not a total waste of time, it came close.  Far too much print was devoted to the half-hearted team meetings of people in mud colored clothing as they outlined ever more convoluted theories as to who had done what to and with whom.  This  is yet another book that lacks credibility or suspense.  
 I read this book many years ago, and thought it was terrible.  Looking through the reviews just now, I couldn't believe how overwhelmingly positive they were, and just had to put in a word for those of us (and I assume/hope there are others) who didn't like the book.  The book is ludicrously long, and meanders through way too many red herrings, dead ends, and nonsequitirs.  There are any number of sub-plots that appear out of nowhwere, go nowhere, never pay off, and leave you wondering why you had to take the time to read through them at all.  The sub-plots, though, are nothing like as much of a problem as the main plot itself.  It's a very uninspiring story about a business deal.  Will person A get the contract, or will person B?  A business deal?  Who cares?  SPOILER ALERT:  And then, after sitting through thousands of pages boringly building up to the big deal, at the end one of the characters randomly dies, and the whole thing just peters out.  No climax, no drama, nothing.  I also respectfully disagree with the reviewers who praised the characters.  I found that Clavell has a bad habit of making his characters too perfect, carried out too far in this book.  All of the major characters are the greatest golfer and an olympic diver and the greatest gourmet and a brilliant business person and so on and so on.  These are not real people, they're supermen who I couldn't relate to at all.  It's boring, it's long, it's badly written.  I was particularly disappointed because I loved Shogun and liked Tai-pan and King Rat.  But after this one, I've never read another Clavell book, and I don't think I will 
 I was livid at the author's underestimation of the intelligence of the American consumer and investor.  With his ludicrous assertion that the US and the world economy and the value of currency should be limited by the arbitrary supply of a yellow metal is ridiculous and has been pilloried for more than a half century by actual economists.  His arguments to support his conclusions are so fraught with logical fallacies, any senior high school debator could rip it apart.  His fundamental lack of understanding of debt-backed securities is frightening as is his assertion that the US Government controls the money supply and the whimsical printing thereof.  For someone who lambastes with such slavering scorn, the Federal Reserve Bank of the US, I'm surprised he hasn't actually realized that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 privatized monetary policy decisions in the US to prevent the federal government's capricious issuing of currency.  In addition, if you're going to take on John Maynard Keynes and Alan Greenspan, it would help to have a solid litany of proof, rather than scattered and fragmented anecdotal evidence that spans perhaps 6 fiscal quarters at best.  Also, when explaining the beginning and end of trends, especially referring to the recent rise in gold prices, cite actual data and genuine trends.  Any novice at Excel could plot the points you gave and realize that the trend started well before the 2001 recession. Throwing up a graph and misrepresenting its data further impugns the author's credibility and his "agenda."  Furthermore, Mr. Wiggin, as  a follower and commentator on the currency markets, the dollar is down only against the euro--hardly a "demise."  All other currencies in the world, peg themselves to the dollar because of the US's robust economy.  Eastern European and other black markets deal in dollars.  Perhaps you should take Macroeconomics 101 again and refresh your memory on the concept of debt-backed securities, get a tutor to explain Keynes and write something that will do more than foment hysteria and promulgate misinformation and wild unsubstantiated conclusions.  And--return America to an beleaguered economy manufacturing expensive goods with that no one else wants to buy (think GM and its overwrought pension fund)--what are you thinking?  It would be nice to see a relevant observation with a logically sound conculsion.  Wiggin completely disregards the (Growing) portion of US GDP that is a direct result of services and entertainment and bemoans--in Jeremiah fashion--that doom is imminent because manufacturing's share of the GDP is declining.  His right-wing, Bo-Gritz-for-president, unsubstantiated diatribe may be gospel at a Libertarian mass meeting, but his economic sturm-und-drang just doesn't pass academic or serious financial scrutiny.  While Americans are heavy spenders and should save more, it's a perilous leap in logic to assume that the economy itself on the verge of collapse. Perhaps Wiggin should consult Moody's and Standard and Poors for a primer on the term "creditworthiness." I'm far more open to a study of the legitimate problems with the US economy--inflation, the transfer of wealth from manufacturing to services, or even the disappearance of the middle class.    All in all, Wiggin refuses to acknowledge the single, saving grace of a falling dollar--American goods and services cost less abroad--and more people consume what we have to offer.  An abysmal disappointment. Nothing more than a peurile rant from a two-bit charlatan. 
 I have owed Hoovers for years.  When the old one started burning through belts, I found the WT II with the lifetime belt.  "Brilliant!" I thought.  I thought wrong.  This vacuum is clumbsy, roles poorly on any surface, and the gaskets don't seal well so all of the superfine dust falls behind the collection box instead of in it.  The plastic hook that holds the hose broke first time out.  For $300, it should work better.  I should have spent $400 for the Dyson-- anyone I know with one loves it 
 First off, I am a fan of the original series - Escaflowne. It's by far up there in the top 5 of favorite anime. It had a lot of memorable characters, good action and a pretty decent story.  This is not an original Escaflowne. It does not take part before or after the series. It doesn't take place somewhere in the middle. It takes most of the main characters from the series and totally retells the entire story to fit into a movie. The result? Not a fan. Basically, because the entire movie you see a 30 second introduction to old characters in suped up animation with no depth. For example, the twin cat girls that were so fond Lord Falcon, show up instead for a brief 30 seconds as singers on stage in a bar. Ummm yuck. Lots of the more memorable characters are subjugated to this. Perhaps, if you seen this first it would be a decent watch. For myself, I was very disappointed.  The good points of this movie is the animation is upgraded and the soundtrack is well done.  Even as a standalone product, the movie has no flow or depth to it. It's basically just a compressed retelling of Escaflowne. I'd rent this and skip it as a purchase. If you want to purchase something, get the Escaflowne series. You will be much happier 
 We all like hearing scary stories about monsters.  This book provides a few of them.  Because of its pulp horror novel quality it has some redeaming value.  The negatives make it not only a bad read, but make me wish that I had not read it. 1) The author spends a lot of time tooting his own horn. This is fine, but you grow weary of it after a few chapters.  It wouldn't be so annoying but because of the way he writes comes off as if he is trying too hard to make it sound like NOT bragging.  Because of this I grew very aware of it, like when your tounge won't stop worrying at a new tooth-filling. 2) It grows very predictable.  We get it!  Serial killers are psychos who fit into patterns and act out fantasies. It isn't a surprise anymore once we learned this early in the book. 3) Ressler brags about his profile helping to send 4-5 Chicago teenagers to prison for a a grusome murder/rape.  A decade after this book went to press DNA evidence and discovery of the real killers proved that these kids had been railroaded--unequivocally innocent.  Ooops!  This incredibly gross injustice wouldn't seem so terrible if Ressler didn't come off as such a judgemental, I-told-you-so-ing, J. Edgar Hoover loving cop's cop 
 After two hours of watching it, I still don't know what it was about.  Yes, the scenery is fantastic, but a National Geographic film would have done more.    I applaud the acting of Milla Jovovich, and Nastassja Kinski.  But, the kudos reviewers have given to Peter Mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie.  I hardly heard anything he said and there are no English subtitles offered on the dvd.  As for Wes Bentley, that's acting?  He kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him, or a co-worker being blown to "Kingdom Come" (that's a pun based on the movie).  He makes Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier.    The film is supposedly based on a Thomas Hardy book, but very loosely based, and the scriptwriters should have at least used Cliff Notes to have learned more about the story and the character development.  They obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest.   
 No...the answer to the question above, is that these guys are a metal version of a boy band, generated to sell records and appeal to the angry and mis-guided youth of America. They provide no great contribution or originality to music at all. A couple monkey like sounds from the singer with a sort of rappish vocals and repetitive guitars is all this band has to offer. Really, what is so great about these guys? Their anger and angst? Their musical abilities(HA HA). I have heard all of their albums and I hate them all, they have no talent and they pretty much rode on the NU-Metal wave, which has long since crashed against the sandy shores of real music and receded back into the depths where crappy music with no skill or talent belongs. Each song sounds the same, follows the same formula and style. All of the songs practically blend together. At least on their sophomore release they tried some to incorporate some different things into their music, and failed miserably. And their latest album? It is just as horrid and un-original as everything else they have made.. 
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 I love smooth jazz and while there are a couple of slick instrumental jazz tracks, the rest is junk to me.  If you want to be a music group that does vocals, then promote yourself as that.  This disc has too many vocal tracks for me.  I wasted my money on this disc and its a shame because Walter Beasley is a great jazz musician 
 I was really disappointed with this book.  A lot of the recipes are identical to one another, with just one ingredient - eg a different type of vegetable - substituted.  With no pictures and not much more content, I really regret buying it.  
 This book is exactly as the title describes and introduction to mechatronics. The content is not detailed enough even for a undergraduate engineer. It,s a book fun to have with the real stuff. Nothing as modelling ans simpification technieuqs is given. The emphesis is to much on theory and not practical designing. To much digital processing 
 I bought this book looking for simple ways to bring my daughter into the Catholic faith. Not only was I disappointed, I was enraged in some places.  The author believes people should have altars in thier homes and complete blinding obedience to the faith.  If you live like the author expects you to, then you don't need this book.  If you live like most Catholics do, find another book, because this book is only for those with extreme versions of what it means to be Catholic 
 I think this movie was a complete waste of my time and money.  The movie was so bad that, from now on, it will only collect dust on my shelf.  I highly discourage anyone considering this movie. It is nearly a joke with the shallow acting, over-done sound effects and thin plot. Terrible...Terrible...Terrible.  
 Anyone with the smallest bit of sense knows that *true* Christians never get sick.  If this gentleman was ever really sick, then he simply did not read his bible enough or he had a lack of faith.  Furthermore, if you just read Dr. Don Colbert's book about what Jesus ate and cooked (even while on the cross), then this should never pose a problem. But, there's always the possibility that, even if you do have a lack of faith, or are not a real Christian, just make sure that before you finally kick the bucket, you pray to God to heal you, say you're sorry and promise to go to church, say you belive in Him, change your wicked ways, and soon you'll be dancing in the sunshine.  That always works 
 Oh those were the days, when I was in college, reading my first issues and then subscribing.  There were great things to be found in its pages, columns by Brian Crozier, Russell Kirk, Erik von Kuenhelt-Leddhin (sp?).  The great struggle with the Soviet Union was going into a critical stage.  It seemed NR was so on the right track.  And it was wonderful to read, at least from about 1979 to 1983.  But then it became for a while duller.  It had some periods of recrudescence, such as under the editorship of John O'Sullivan.  But when Rich Lowry took over NR really began to dumb down (nothing personal Mr. Lowry).  But what I've really discovered of late is how badly the neo-con agenda has sort have taken over the magazine.  We've got in the 50th Anniversary issue a call by Midge Dector to rally the country to our illegal and immoral war in Iraq.  Really something has happened to the magazine, a sinister force has entrenched itself there.  What is that force?  Well, go to come-and-hear.com and you will begin to learn part of the picture, especially when you read the material by Elizabeth Dilling.  I would also recommend Paul Findley's THEY DARE TO SPEAK OUT, which details the Israeli Lobby's domination of our Congress.    NR was once a courageous conservative magazine, but now it has been heavily tainted by the influence of a terrible thing. WFB should know better, and maybe he does.  If he doesn't, then he should pick up NEO-CONNED! and NEO-CONNED AGAIN!, and then he should listen to Tony Martin's talk given to the IHR on a certain group's tactics deployed to suppress free speech.    What has inspired me to write this review is WFB's recent column on the incarceration of David Irving.  It ends in a disgusting gloating.  WFB has fallen into an evil trap, and so has the magazine he used to run.  What has happened to the Christian faith of people like Buckley?  He now seems lost and terribly afraid of offending that supposedly saintly interest group...And you, Mr. Lowry, come on now: read widely and deeply and don't be afraid of reading the Talmud and about the Israeli lobby.  Once you do, maybe you'll develop the strength to think outside the box.  We're going to have to do that if we want anything but the bleakest future for mankind and the planet.   
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 So annoying to be told again and again how the British treat dogs better than the locals... and all the rest! Even complaining about the food he gets (for free). I would like one day to walk up to his house in Scotland, smelly and with a mangy dog, and see what kind of food I get 
 I wasn't that pleased with this book. I was hoping to find something that would inlighten me to how to react in social meeting and dinner parties.  Instead it was just chapter after chapter of someone's thoughts and personal stories.  I won't even offer this gift as a gift to someone.  Just because you are Emily Post's great grandson doesn't mean her talents run in you family 
 This waffle maker broke at the two hinge pins within one year of purchase.  Parts are not available.  Top is hinged to bottom with two small plastic caps that are poorly made at best.  Unable to repair had to throw it out 
 The episodes for Naruto are quality but in this case, due to errors in the description I can not recommend the DVD.  When I ordered the DVD, I made sure to check the language options of the DVD.  This one indicates that a Japanese language option is available.  Unfortunately this is incorrect.  If you do not mind this being an all english DVD with the television broadcast editting, than this is for you.  Naruto is not so far editted compared to other anime series that the series is hampered and the english actors do a relatively good job with the translation.  However, if you prefer the japanese version, this DVD is not for you. 
 The acting was very good. The pace was adequate. However, the plot was predictable. The movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome. Clive's character kept calling this the perfect robbery. The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can't possibly know what is going on. I'm still not sure what Jody Foster's character brings to the plot.    Any way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don't know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a "s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them. They were disguised as painters. Why couldn't Clive's character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine.   Finding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn't guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues. For example, a big one is the title of the movie. However, the lame clues (the s--thole) acted like red herrings. They threw me off the scent.  
 I say this book is so biased I couldn't even finish it. So if you are pro- israel regardless of the truth this book is great for you, if you are seeking the truth don't waste your time on this book.  
 I had to buy a new one, and I chose another brand (Logitech) this time.  There is no On/Off button, so the batteries run out if you don't take them out (I think the buttons are pressed during transportation). Now the battery contacts are not functioning properly.  And I had the same problem described in a recent review: "I'll click three or four times and nothing happens. Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end. It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen." 
 Although the illustrations are lovely and we both love unicorns, the story was just not good.  It was also too descriptive in places for the age range listed.  The story is about mankind destroying the forests and a lot of dialogue between the unicorn and the little girl.  It was really just plain boring 
 Levine sounds reasoned until the reader asks questions. He notes that at Berkeley the white student population declined from 68% in 1974 to 37% in 1994 while 75% of America was white at that time. Assuming all is equal, which of course it isn't, one would expect equal representation by demographic percentage. The obvious question is, if America were 75% white in 1994 why would only 37% be admitted to Berkeley? Could whites be disadvantaged, incapable of passing Berkeley's rigorous standards, or because Berkeley practices racist admission policies? Levine writes this "is more representative of the nation's population" but as it fails numerically the reader is left to wonder in what way it is more representative? He adds that Berkeley became the first major university with a majority of minority students, revealing early his emphasis on race, not education and his philosophy, as expanded on by Arthur M. Schlesinger's "Disuniting Of America".  Levine's book is a response to Alan Bloom's critique of modern American university education in "The Closing Of The American Mind" and that of a multitude of others throughout Western civilization in academia and out. Bloom is at times recklessly and conveniently misrepresented while at others accurate enough to cause wonder at what Levine could possibly disagree with? Levine paints Bloom as anti-multiculturalist. However, as Bloom notes, Herodotus was a multiculturalist too as we should be, but with a different intent than now practiced, rather to learn what was unknown about the human condition, not to return from his travels to dismantle his homeland by removing Greek (Western) thinking as a "bias" suppressive of others, which is Levine's position repeated throughout the book, generally between the lines.   Levine characterizes criticism of our university system and its politics as "conservative" because, in Foucaultian form, it focuses on who said it, not what they say or if it might be true. No debate. Yet Levine swears by open-mindedness - as long as it does not clash with his agenda and that of our university administrators. Using out-of-context sound bites Levine relishes remarks by his critics as crazy eyed, apocalyptic non-sense, lumping all into the same bucket - though many would vehemently clash on details of their opposition. Never is there a hearing on recorded events and practice on campus from which these criticisms are sourced. We can only assume their root as Levine focuses on change as a constant at the university through history, so we suppose change is the problem for conservatives. But course offerings in LP-record scratching as musical expression at Levine's very Berkeley causes one to wonder just what higher education has become? Where once the mundane banality of history was taught, but a history taught from the standpoint of events and civilizations not from the perspective of groups, which he prefers. If the current university anti-West, race-focused dogma is not apocalyptic for institutions once concerned more for education than diversity, what is?   Levine marginalizes opposition by the oft-used method of obfuscation. Issues are just too complicated, vast, impenetrable, given such mixture, morphing attitudes or flux of opinions in the marketplace of ideas to make a conclusion. That "conclusion" is happy news for Levine as it is self-serving keeping his dogma in place and in power. Practicing a Creationist favorite, Levine puts words in the mouth of his critic's then tells how wrong they are. "It surely was much simpler when the university community was a homogeneous one..." A statement critics would agree with but not condone nor dare make against the muscle of today's climate of political correctness.   Levine smacks of anti-West creed throughout, dismissing with a sneer those who could possibly claim "the West is good", as though only naive fools would utter such "myth" and "propaganda". Levine's book is readable, though not the penetrating, elevating work Bloom offered.  Levine does reveal what his side of our politicized universities stand for and against and in that his text has value as a measure of how bad things are. 
  Wanting something to read on vacation, I hurriedly grabbed the Vintage paperback edition from a dusty shelf in the back of my home office.  The book had belonged to my stepson many years ago. As I thumbed through the pages, it began to fall apart.   I do not recall having to read The Sound and the Fury in college, but I knew it was famous.  Other than that, I came to the book with an open mind but expecting excellence.  To that end, I was sorely disappointed, despite some fine passages, but even those often contained unclear elements.     From the start the story came across as gibberish.  Time jumped around, and characters appeared with little or no introduction.  Gradually a sense of story began to sink in, but by then, what might have been significant in the earlier pages was already lost to me.  I wondered what connection the title had to the story.  I struggled through the entire book, finding later sections to be more coherent, particularly the last, but I was unable to gain a full appreciation of the story.  And I wasn't about to reread the book repeatedly to obtain it.   There seems to be no effort at word economy, particularly in dialogue.  There are endless rambling paragraphs and only four "chapters" for the 400 pages of text.   Worst of all, there is inadequate exposition throughout the book.  There is no introduction telling the reader how the book is constructed, most notably, that it begins with an account by an idiot.  The idea of having a family's story related by several  members if fine, so is writing in stream of conscious, but adequate exposition is needed to orient the reader.     Frustrated during the reading, I thumbed through it and discovered the appendix which described the Compson family.  Most of this material should have been presented early in the book, but even that would not have provided adequate exposition.  After reading the book, I learned that the appendix was added some time after the first edition to help the reader.  That should be a big hint that the book is lacking in exposition.  I believe that good exposition is the responsibility of a writer.   This book is more of a puzzle than a story, and the latter is sacrificed for the former.  The author does not lead you through the story; he throws you into it.  For those who marvel at the literary value of this book, I say, "The emperor has no clothes. 
 Bill Murray plays Bill Murray.  He has the same dead-pan, expressionless delivery he often has. He manifests the same childish humor here as in Saturday Night Live.  So what if he sits on top of a snow topped mountain? There is no dialog that can demonstrate he did more than sleep there.  There is not an ounce of real Buddhism here.  And when the Buddhist monk says, "The path to salvation is narrow and difficult, like walking the razor's edge," I say "What salvation?"  Buddhism is not about salvation, it is about escaping sorrow by renunciation and following the 8 fold path.  I question the taste and knowledge of the reviewers who gave this show 5 stars.  I got this movie because of the rave reviews here and felt betrayed 
 This is not the translation by Arthur Waley (which is very good) but the one by D.C. Lau. Since Lau's translation was first published, a number of advances have been made in the field of Warring States Period scholarship which render a fair amount of the supporting material obsolete (see "The Original Analects" by Brooks and Brooks for the latest). As for the translation itself, it's rife with awkward and mystifying word choices -- for instance, in a passage in chapter 11 in which the disciple Zilu (Tzu-lu, in Wade-Giles romanization, which Lau uses) gets the better of Confucius in an argument, Waley translates the Master's retort, "It is remarks of that kind that make me hate glib people," and the Brookses and Huang Chichung make similar choices; but Lau renders it, "It is for this reason that I dislike men who are plausible." Similar mishandlings of connotation appear throughout the book. For an old-fashioned translation, Waley's is a hundred times better 
 Needleman had some interesting stories but I didn't find the book all the helpful or entertaining.  I had to read it for class and the only good part about the assignment was the class discussions, most of which had little to do with the actual book.  I thought it had potential and I was excited about reading this book but ended up being dissappointed.  It is a VERY easy book to read and you can fly through the pages.  I ended up reading a lot and not really understanding or getting anything from what I just read.  
 I have seen some bad ones in my day but this is the worst. I couldn't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life on it. They literally stole scenes from Runaway Train in this. Not the ideas, they stole the filmed scenes. The train kept going from one engine to the four in RT. The continuity was a joke. Had a semi truck go from tandem axle to single back to tandem. Seems like some of the actors must have had a house payment coming up 
 As a youngster I read this book so often the school librarian would chuckle each time I checked it out.  Then, for years, I completely forgot about it.  During that time I lived and worked in the Orinoco and Amazon Basin as a field biologist.  When I re-discovered this title I had been working in Amazonian Peru for over a decade.  Happy to find the book, I purchased a copy and read it again.  Only this time I found myself laughing out loud.  Clark did in fact get around while he was in Peru, but he clearly had little understanding of either Spanish or Quechua, and he had a vivid imagination.  His facts are such an unreliable mishmash that I could tell immediately where he spent the majority of his time down there: in the bar of the hotel.  Perhaps the most telling thing is that, with experience in the region, one can discern the kernel of truth at the heart of each of Clark's fabrications.  It is far more instructive to read the journals of great scientist-explorers like Alfred Russel Wallace, Richard Spruce, or Bates...all of whom traversed the Amazon under much more grueling conditions.  Their accounts reveal all the wonders and hardships of the area but with none of the silly exaggerations 
 This product was absolutely awful.  First of all it is VERY picky about the USB port you are using.  My first attempt was to use it through a USB hub, because my mac mini doesn't have enough free ports.  It did not like the USB hub at all.  The second issue I had was range.  I was not able to use it from more than 20 feet away, and even within 10 feet it was not able to go through items at all.  This is an RF remote, but it still required line of site to work reliably.  I was able to stop it from working by putting it behind a large pillow.  Pathetic 
 I turned it off after 20 minutes 
 The premier issue of this magazine will go down in the annals of craftdom as a total scam.  The magazine's cover features a beautiful knit robot from a pattern by Jess Hutch, BUT THE PATTERN IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE MAGAZINE.  Moreover, the pattern is NOT AVAILABLE anywhere as Ms. Hutch has ceased publishing the booklet in which it was originally featured & it is totally sold out.  What a complete disaster for those of us who subscribed hoping to have access to the pattern when we learned it would be on the cover.[...]  
 Inaccurate.  The same issues that plague cheaper scales.  I might accept this if it was a $20 scale, but it isn't.  A scale this price should at least be able to produce accurate weight readings.  Do not buy if you can find something comparable with good accuracy 
 I was intrigued by "Satan's Little Helper" due to several things namely its Halloween theme, which I'm a big sucker for, and the heralded return of Jeff Lieberman to the horror scene.  Lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the 70's and 80's, the last one being 1987's "Remote Control".  You would think that Lieberman, with all this time off from filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to return.  Well, it almost feels like Lieberman is stuck in some kind of time warp, as this movie looks like it came straight from the 80's due to how cheesy, trashy, cheap and godawful it is.  Many, myself included, look upon the 80's slasher craze with fond nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some of those films could be.  The "plot" revolves around a 10-year old boy who is a huge fan of the video game "Satan's Little Helper".  It's now Halloween season and his mom buys him a devil costume, which he wears proudly.  One afternoon, he spots a tall man wearing an equally devilish costume dragging bodies around to serve as Halloween decoration stiffs for the front of his house.  He becomes enamored with the tall & mute masked man and asks him if he can be his helper.  The two then go on a rampage throughout the small suburban community, as the masked man kills people randomly in gruesome fashion all the while the boy (whose intelligence quotient appears to be much closer to a 5-year old than a 10-year old) inexplicably thinks it's all still a game of make believe.  If you think the plot sounds bad that's nothing compared to how poorly this movie is executed.  Nearly everything about it is god-awful from the camcorder film quality, to the laughable gore effects (including the least-ever convincing intestines I've ever seen) and especially, the acting. The 10-year old boy, who appears in nearly every scene, makes a run for most annoying child actor in recent memory.  The acting on just about everyone's part is bad, and the characters all come across as being mentally retarded from the clueless boy to the mute villain who kills for no apparent or explained reason, the flaky sister and the eccentric, kooky mother.  There is not a single character we can give a darn about and we don't care the least bit when someone gets killed.  Granted, dumb characters who do dumb things in horror movies are a dime a dozen, but these ones truly take the cake.    I'm a little baffled as to why this movie has gotten its share of enthusiastic reviews.  I'm thinking some people are going to put this in the "so good it's bad" category but I'm not having it.  Some of the scenes in the movie that were meant to be "funny", such as the parking lot scene where the villain and boy knock off a pregnant woman, an elderly lady, and a stroller carrying a kid, are downright appalling.  The villain himself is a bad joke, as he doesn't utter a single word throughout the film, instead delivering thumbs-up signs to the kid and wagging his finger.  Cheesy?  Heck, this film is cheesier than a Black Diamond factory.  "Satan's little helper" comes across as the work of a first-time wannabe horror amateur with no budget, not something from a guy in his fifties considered a cult filmmaker.  To sum up how I feel about this film, I will repeat a line that I see all over Amazon that I usually feel redundant but somehow I find to be entirely fitting for this movie.  DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS GARBAGE!!   
 After reading the reviews I was really looking forward to getting this book. And while I was reading it I was trying hard to like it. But it didn't happen. The book is more about attitude than actually what to say or do to close a sale. But attitude is real important, thats why I gave it a 2 star rating. There are some closes in here where he tells you to lie. Don't know how he does that and sleeps at night, but I'm not going to do it. If you want actuall closes read Tom Hopkins, damn good. Overall I wish I hadn't spent the time reading this and put the time in something more worthwhile. I won't be ordering the closers 2 
 Gee,the CD seemed fine. My favorites are here. "Everything She Wants" (original),"Freedom","Young Guns (Go For It)","Where Did Your Heart Go?","Careless Whisper"...hey,wait a second..."Careless Whisper" ain't on here. The ultimate George Michael/Wham! ballad and this is supposed to be a greatest hits album and that song missed? "A Different Corner" also? Because of stupid remixes of "I'm Your Man" & "Everything She Wants"?  Huh,I rather listen to ANDREW RIDGELEY's solo album than those remixes. Really! Psyche 
 This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life.  If you are expecting another classic like "Anchorman" watch another movie.  I was terribly dissapointed with Will Ferrell.  DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE 
 While this is a great movie, this DVD reproduction does it severe injustice. The sound track is out of sync and the production quality of the DVD is marginal 
 It's hard to have much confidence in a book that is so obviously slanted toward a particular agenda.  For example, in the discussion of tracking, Spring cites one study that found "few benefits" of tracking, but makes no mention of other studies that found benefits to students of various levels (Loveless, 1999; Epstein & MacIver, 1992).  This is political correctness with a vengeance, and I would not rely on this biased and polemical book to become informed about the issues 
 I was informed that this particular text book was in new condition and that it came with the scantron test form sheet. Not only did it NOT have the scantron test form sheet I needed but it had writing and highlighted parts inside the book. (answers for quizzes not sure if correct)After several e-mails to the seller I sent it back for a refund. (She said she could only send half)I am still waiting for my money. I had to buy a new book at the college bookstore 
 Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with "S". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.  I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.  I would vote pass on this one. 
 I suppose if you need to find out about generic marketing info. this book could be for you. But I can assure you the author has almost zero having to do with mortgages in the book.  It is just the same old guerrila marketing info. you would find in the guerrila marketing book with the absence of anything specific to the mortgage industry. In fact, the author mentions as examples of things to do, give out free samples.   I do not know of anyone giving a "free sample" mortgage, so obviously the author was just spinning the same old guerrila marketing spin all over again and only changed the title. Do yourself a favor and buy a book that pertains to the mortgage industry 
 This book (I believe) is one of Lem's earlier stories and it reads like so-so pulp sci-fi. Fiasco (a true 5 star science fiction novel) picks up the idea of contacting a new world and does it so much better. I suggest reading this only if you are a Lem completist (I've read all of his stuff except 2 books) 
 I didn't find any information in this book that was particularly enlightening.  Most was basic and there was little useful mention of how these issues manifest in adulthood---or suggestions for change.  The author bounces back and forth from how it affects the child still in the alcoholic home to the adult child.  It would be more beneficial to separate those stages and focus on one or the other.  I found it difficult to apply her information in any useful way 
 My 3 dogs recently start fighting and was frantic about what to do since they live inside with me 24/7. I had fights that landed one of my dogs in the ER room so this was a serious problem. I  have obedience trained all my dogs so I am not a novice. I   heard this author on the local radio station where I live and thought his book may be helpful. It was not. It is very basic stuff I already knew. I found Patricia McConnell, PH.D.'s 30 page pamphlett "The Cautious Canine"to be much more helpful than this author's 230 page book. If your problem is strickly aggression and or fearful shy dogs then this book does not address enough detail about what to do.  I think it may be a good book for any new or inexperienced dog owner that covers basics. I have since restored peace in my house with some new ground rules and appointing the right dog to alpha status so it can be done 
 Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect 
 I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell. 
 Gee...let's find a gimmick/twist on the sugar topic so we can sell books.  Let's fly in the face of all the other sugar books and say that potatoes are good.  But then we are not surprised at what people will do to make money off the thousands of people just looking for good scientifically based information, are we 
 I bought this oven recently. It is cheaply made but most of the functions do a fair job. All except the rotisserie; when used, grease runs from the unit onto the countertop even though the unit is level and the drip tray is not full. I was very dissapointed. I contacted them via email today, they say they will get with me in 24 hrs. We'll see 
 My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.   The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.  That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.   And  no, I do not believe there was any such child. 
 I debated whether to give this book 1 or 2 stars. At first I was going to give it 2 stars as I thought LKH did a better job with this book than she did with the ABVH book Danse Macabre. I settled on 1 star after thinking about all of the things that bothered and/or disappointed me about this book.   My biggest problem were the scenes with Sholto. I hated what she did to him which I'm not going to say because I don't want to give anything away. However, to me it seemed like LKH was taking the easy way out. She took away any "specialness" and made it "ordinary". The scenes between Merry and Sholto could have been Merry and AnyGuy.   There were many other disappointments for me in this book. I'm not sure if the deficiencies of Mistral's Kiss were magnified for me as I had just finished reading a number of books (the latest from Kim Harrison, JR Ward and Lynsay Sands to start) which, IMO, were head and shoulders above anything coming from LKH lately. 
 I was so looking forward to reading this book.  It sounded like a good read.   I forced myself to read 100 pages hoping it was just a slow take off.  Not so.  Don't bother 
 I wanted more recipes and this magazine has too much other junk in it.  Will not renew, not what I wanted 
 I don't expect Aiken to fool me into thinking that this is Austen's work, but I do expect a competent novel.   This was initially promising, but it begins to descend into melodrama.   The ending is very perfunctory; the heroine finds her "true love" with almost magically with little development of their relationship.   What is there is quite good, it is just not substantial enough for me to believe that the moment Emma catches sight of him, she knows that they are going to be married.  After reading this and Lady Catherine's necklace, Aiken's sequel to Pride and Prejudice, it appears to me that the author is rather bored with romances - I strongly recommend that she try writing something else.   It is possible to write a historical novel of this period without leeching off of Austen.  I strongly recommend John Coates' finishing of this fragment, The Watsons. 
 The camera was an excellent one, it took very high-quality pictures; however, it broke a little more than a year after I bought it, it wouldn't power on for an unknown reason, and it was exactly 14 days out of the one-year warranty! The repair cost is rather expensive: $184. I would rather buy a new one than to send it for repair 
 There are some cuts that are pretty good but doesn't live up to my expections - i would much rather listen to Thug Motivation 10 
 Here we go: This book is the most turgid, arduous, impenetrable conglomeration of words I've ever come across (Finnegans Wake excepted).  It brinks back memories of my school days in fourth year Latin and causes one to wish again that Virgil HAD burned The Aeneid, so as not to plague us fourth year A-level students, and - even more so, so that Broch would not have this pretentious trope on which to found a spurious Parnassus of fuddled and addled - dense to the point that all poetry is eclipsed - book of....whatever it is.  For -and this is the crux here - this book is not poetic, not the work of a master stylist at all.  How many stylists use the same phrase, to wit, "humus of existence" at least fifteen times (I ceased counting after that)?  Answer: None.  They don't rely on the same phrase so often that it becomes cliché.  And then there is the prescient notion of Broch's Virgil of a coming saviour.  I wonder if this has anything to do with Broch's conversion to Catholicism in the last years of his life.  The point here is not pro or anti Christianity---The point is: What on earth does Broch mean by having his Virgil go on about a saviour of "perception" rather than mere poets, whose words occlude, rather than clarify perception?  Perception implies an object.  So, we are not amiss to ask: Perception of what?  Broch goes on in such muddled prose that one gleans nothing from the book itself.  But, of course, we all know what he is talking about when he brings in, time and again, the three-in-one godhead et cetera.  This book is best suited to theology and philosophy students who, for whatever reason, really do fancy quibbling over dense passages that lead nowhere, over abstruse points of doctrine, over meaningless verbiage.  Lovers of literature, take a pass.    
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 Strange to say, I did not like this novel nearly as much as her earlier work.  I usually find her narrative voice and her attention to detail charming and engaging, but here it bogged down and just became tedious.  There are no fully-drawn characters, only types, including the heroine (or should I say "hairoyne" -- from a motif in the novel) herself.  And, while I found the dilemmas of her earlier characters regarding marriage and identity quite moving, especially in "Another Marvelous Thing" and "Family Happiness," I found Geraldine's crises to border on the selfish and self-absorbed.  Who knows what might have followed this swan song?  For all of that, I do love Colwin, and I still cook from her cookbooks 
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 That is the call to action by Congressman J.D. Hayworth, representing the 5th Congressional District of Arizona.  In his book, Whatever it Takes, Congressman Hayworth sets to the task of explaining why it is so crucially important to finally get control of the Southern border with respect to the flow of illegal immigrants.  Not only is the porousness of the border dangerous to the national security of the United States, but it is dangerous to the security of American workers.  Focusing on the social problems which accompany unregulated, illegal immigration, the burdens placed on the education and medical systems, the criminal behavior of immigrants during their illegal entry and the threats caused by a fractious multiculturalism, Hayworth lays out his solution to the problem: immigration reform centered on strong enforcement policies.  Not only would the author like to see a security wall built from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, but it must be monitored by a significant increase in Border Patrol agents using modern high-tech surveillance devices to stem the flow of human traffic.  Moreover, he stresses that interior enforcement of businesses that hire illegal immigrants is the key to any successful immigration reform policy.  It is not enough to try and stop the flow of illegal immigrants at the border alone.  Through the penalization of businesses that hire illegal immigrants, the magnetic force which pulls illegal immigrants to cross the border in the first place would be reduced.  Not only is it necessary to enforce the current immigration laws that the United States already has, but the author elucidates new laws which should be enacted allowing the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service the ability to communicate freely with the Department of Homeland Security to stem the illegal use of forged documents by illegal immigrants to obtain jobs and collect payroll checks.    Congressman Hayworth is unapologetic in his diatribe as he deems the atmosphere of political correctness and race baiting surrounding the illegal immigration debate as disingenuous.  The overly sensitive manner in which illegal immigration is discussed is dangerous to our security, insomuch as it disallows serious discussion of the issues.  In his dismissive attitude of political correctness, he affords himself the opportunity to also address even more controversial subjects such as ending birthright citizenship laws for children born to illegal immigrants, ending "sanctuary" laws that forbid local and state police from providing information to federal immigration officers, limiting the issue of Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers so that illegal immigrants cannot obtain home loans or other financial services, establishing English as the national language of the United States, ending all bilingual education and denying social services and in-state tuition to illegal immigrants and their children.  Clearly the immigration debate is something which Congressman Hayworth is distinctly familiar with.  The 5th District of Arizona, while not directly on Mexico's border, is in the southern half of the state and experiences the migratory effects of illegal immigration directly.  First elected in 1994, Congressman Hayworth is solidly a Republican, with a voting record showing his conservative credentials.  However, his arguments opposing illegal immigration are nothing new and his book is, at often times, an inflammatory diatribe against the "liberal elite" and the "left-wing groups" who support "amnesty" for illegal immigrants.  With the distinct polarization of supporters and opponents of various immigration reform policies, Hayworth's book fits in nicely with Pat Buchanan's "State of Emergency" and Tom Tancredo's "In Mortal Danger," all three of which share the hard-line, strict enforcement approach towards solving the illegal immigration issue.  Congressman Hayworth falls victim, in a significant way, to just what he disparages in his book; the absolutism of his ideology and brusque manner of communicating his ideas leads to a diminution of articulate debate.  As such, the book is more of a duplicitous reactionary rant than it is a well thought-out and researched appeal to tighten the U.S.-Mexico border.  Through his use of oversimplified sloganeering, most of his arguments are based on the fact that because an illegal immigrant has broken the law to enter the United States, it does not matter what the immigrant may do for work, or in what ways immigrants may contribute to American society; the fact that they broke the law is tantamount and needs to be punished.  As much as I can appreciate his passionate appeal to "do something," Hayworth's approach to the problem, and more importantly, his disdain for liberalism in general, leads me to believe that a serious discussion of the relevant issues involved in the immigration debate would be lost in the rhetoric of his ideology 
 This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
 Two main comments.  Firstly, the book is mistitled or I misread the meaning of the title and I would be delighted to return it.  This is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform "tricks" with much on showmanship.  I have no interest in that but I do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master's care of their puppy and mature dog.  Problems handlers encounter in "greeting" of your dog with other dogs and people.   Secondly, the book, as written, talks down to the reader and unless you have had some professional experience with dogs, you feel very unqualified to read on.  I felt intimidated by it.  
 I really had to work hard to finish this book.  It was a stuggle in the beginning to keep up with the characters and the plot, though by about 3/4 of the way through, it finally started to make sense.  It wasn't my favorite Ludlum book 
  This disc is terrible.  It is a pan&scan transfer, and the picture is soft and blurry.  It is one of the worst DVD's I have ever seen.  The last laserdisc version of this film was letterboxed, so why this travesty was produced, who knows?  Obviously, someone didn't want to spend the money to do it right.  Don't waste your money to buy this.  Sign up for Netflix and rent it whenever you feel like watching it.  Don't put your hard earned cash into studio coffers for garbage like this 
 Yes, that's right.  This worked for me for only one day.  What a disappointment 
 I am an Air Force trained techie and have been for over 15 years.  I have a lot of experience with computers and electronics.  After a lot of research I went with the Hollux GPSlim236.  Initially I was very pleased with the device until it started having problems.    At first it would never lock on with the satellites. (Yellow light stayed on) I found out the unit went into SIRF protocol mode.  I had to find a program called SIRF demo to get it out of SIRF protocol and placed it into the usable protocol of NMEA.      Next the device started having problems with with the Blue tooth connection. (the blue light would never turn on).  I would have to turn the device on and off about 50 times before the magic blue light would turn on, and then sometimes it would only turn on constant and not blink.  I could bypass about 40 times turning it on and off by bouncing the device off my steering wheel.  This is a ridiculous thing to have to do to get it to work.  I emailed tech support and tried to call them all to no response.  Now it is the most finicky device I have ever had.  I am often tempted to throw this piece of junk out the window and be done with it.    I must strongly recommend you stay away from this device and probably Hollux all together.  Now I will have to buy another GPS 
 It's great that little boys who are being potty trained are learning that they have a 'pee pee' and all, but what the heck is a 'pee pee' anyway? I always thought that 'pee pee' comes out of a 'wee wee' and not the other way around.   I was originally intrigued that there were both 'boy' and 'girl' books...is their anatomy so different that they need different books? Apparently not, as the 'once upon a potty-girl' book also says that girls have 'pee pee's'...So I guess the only difference is the color of the flowers...not sure why you need separate books. It's nice though that they have a spanish version of this volume too so our espanol speaking friends can teach their children the value of gender differences too...blue for boys, pink and purple for girls 
 I found the film was poorly directed and photographed. It didnt have a good flow to it. The Duke saves an otherwise poor movie 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 I bought this book based upon Amazon reader reviews. There was little advice that was other than common sense, and much that was silly at best (for example bring water from your old home). The major points could be summed up: have an open mind, be flexible, bring old things so you are comfortable, and find ways to join and meet new people. There you have it. Save your money 
 If you've never used a blackberry at all get this book, but if you actually read any of the instructions that come with it this book is redundant.  I did not learn anything new that I hadn't already read or figured out 
 There are many different opinions about this book. I did read Hotel Paradise but don't remember reading Cold Flat Junction, so that may account for the reasons why I had a hard time getting into this book. I have read Grimes' other novels and numerous Jury books, and I like her style of writing. This book is just not up to par with the others 
 Usually I love books by Silver RavenWolf, but I have mixed feelings about this one. Sure, Silver has some good information in here, but some of it is quite laughable with her overexaggerated facts and ridiculous spell names. Silver has four offspring who all trekked through the teenage years in her household, so she of all people should know that teenagers do not like being talked down to, as she does throughout this entire book. In certain parts of it, I could literally feel her patting me on the head as I read. I would recommend other Silver books like "To Ride A Silver Broomstick" in place of this one, which basically has the same information only goes more into details and less into spells 
 I recieved this calendar as a Christmas gift after raving about the book.  When I opened it at work I was very disappointed to discover that the the quality of the calendar was so poor.  I expected it to be in color!  The book was in color, the box was in color and nowhere did it let you know that it was in black and white.  Also the pictures are washed out and the paper is of a poor quality.  This was not worth the money my husband spent on it and I'm sorry to say that I'll have to buy a calendar because I can't stand looking at this one 
 This book claims to provide an insight into the skills and tactics that McKinsey consultants use. However, it rarely goes beyond generalities i.e. you would find some business concepts that business school grads (and many others) would be well aware of. Not really the McKinsey way 
 The book is definitely nicely dressed, but now I have no faith in its value. Lots of false reviews...Buyer be awar 
 Irving is one of my top favorite authors...but I was SO disappointed in "Until I Find You." I could not relate to any of the characters. I thought they were all miserable and just plain pathetic. I held out until about page 600 until I gave up and put the book down. I didn't even care to know what happened to the main character, Jack, at the end.   Jack's mother is a tattoo artist. The book goes into heavy detail about tattooing, which I found totally unnecessary and frankly, a distraction from an already convoluted plot. In fact, three quarters of the way through the book I still couldn't figure out what exactly we were supposed to care about with this plot.   Was the whole point that that people are misguided, confused and damaged? Who knows. The characters were just so annoying and unlikeable that I found it to be a real chore to read this book.   Read ANY of Irving's other books before this one. 
 This book just drowns in the satire it tries to create.  It takes extremely long just to get to the real plot of the story and throughout that setup it's just the same thing over and over again: Meet a drunk, stupid noble; Befriend him; and buy his dead souls.   If you can get past that, the book becomes a downward spiral of unspired "wit," as people like to call poor commentary on a society 
 I've owned both editions and I totally agree with previous reviewers about preferring the original version. The older version analyzes one book ("The Accidental Tourist") that is easy to get new or used, and won't eat too significantly into time you should be writing instead of reading. The newer version analyzes several books which starts to look more like a book on literary criticism rather than on the writing process. The original is much more process-oriented, since the goal of the reader of this specific book is to get words on the page, not just broaden the amount of novels on the shelf.   Overall, I was disappointed. I thought the newer version was long-winded with lots of unnecessary filler that hindered more than helped. Get the original. It's worth it 
 If I ever had any interest in Zen, this book would squash it! Anderson goes on about how wonderful it is to put the spoons a certain way in the gomasio bowl, and yet when talking about the problems with Richard Baker, comes across as never having the courage to confront him. Maybe he was too busy setting the spoons the right way in the gomasio bowl and holding arcane precepts ceremonies to actually consider how the precepts might work in actual life 
 The play goes along very similar lines as that of the shakespear play  measure for measure as both show selfabsorbtion is a paramount factor  though it does seem like a rewrite is does has its own high points  especially Mosca a very funny character 
 Bought this book to look up some very old records that my folks had. Maybe 1 out of 50 is listed. This book is a piece of doodoo 
 All the reviews from "Customer" from various cities are fake, just false advertising for this very inadequate book. Don't be mislead. Read my real review down below 
 This was a tough one for me. Hew knows his stuff, but this highly condensed presentation was something of a drudgery for me to wade through. Perhaps that's because that is the way the war actually was, he he. There was no time for much reflection, humor or innuendo. Hew had to get it all in one volume and he succeeded by taking the Jack Webb approach; The facts ma'am, just the facts.  I am not very familiar with the geography or the politics of central Europe and this is a huge handicap for readers of Hew's book. While he was going into much detail about troop movements or front locations I was usually kind of lost as I tried putting it all together in my mind. It is as if he assumes the reader is  intimate with the territory.  Well placed detailed maps would have been a great help; these however are lacking. Oh, there are maps all right but they seem to have been inserted as an after thought between the table of contents and the introduction. And they look like sketches hastily drawn up and submitted just in time to meet publishing deadline.  There is a fabulous collection of color photo images of the war. Did you know there was color photography that long ago? I never realized WW1 was so colorful! This was a world war and the color plates show army uniforms from countries outside Europe. They do compliment a decidedly dry text and give the war a very ethnic shine.  This is the first WW1 history I have read. I have read other topics about the war but never a complete overview of the entire war from beginning to end. I am going to try another one because the subject of WW1 has always fascinated me. I am especially interested in the wars aftermath and how it has shaped the world we see today 
 I bought this book based on the good reviews it had received. I could not find any useful infomraiton in this book and the Author seems to go to such great lengths trying to explain governance, but in a very rigid style.  If you are one of those people who have great memory and like to show off by throwing a lot of big nice buzz words, this book is for you. If you would like to really understand governance in a nutshell, I suggest you go elsewhere 
 The book was somewhat useful, but her unprofessional pinching, whenever she could fit it in, littering her otherwise helpful work with jabs against males, left me nauseated after every reading.  Following are just a few examples:  page 23   "You realize what this means--rather than women being "Adam's rib," men are actually the derivative model!"  page 26  "Men have no such luck (or no such constraint, depending on how you look at it)..."  page 63  "Married women have a chronic condition (if you'll excuse the analogy)"  page 122  "[Women] don't buy into the competitive "game" that prevails when men are expressing divergent opinions, and because women are less likely to interrupt, hold the floor, or insist on their opinions, they simply won't volunteer as much information."  page 135  "Although I'm sure it's not true in every category, I think it's safe to say that in most categories, women are more pragmatic than men.  With less interest in the one-upsmanship of novelty, less interest in the inner workings of tech-mech products, and more time pressures than men, women just want products to work easily and reliably."  page 185  "After the meeting, she said to him, 'I was interested to note that you're meeting and greeting--just not with any of the women.'  His response?  'Oh, were there women there?'  She laughed and said, 'Sure there were.  There were 15 or 20 of them.'  Apparently, something in his internal software was registering the women in the room as 'background noise.'"  page 199  "Women are marksmen, not cowboys."  (women are markspeople, if anything; not marksmen; but how is that a comparison anyway?  marksmen and cowboys, marksmen and cowboys.)  page 193  "A guy will talk about how good he is as a way of proving he can do a great job: 'Half of my clients are worth over a million dollars,' he'll say.  Or, 'I doubled his return in six months.'  They talk about achievements, drop names, and let you know where they stand in the company hierarchy.  I call these 'credibility displays,' because they remind me a little of a peacock who's very proud of his tail feathers.  Don't get me wrong--this is the right thing to do in male gender culture." (please tell me I'm the only man who finds this patronizing)  Do read the book though, if you can stomach all the carp.  It will prove enlightening every few dozen pages. 
 Had all the makings of a great book, but the analysis is shallow and very unbalanced. Unfortunately, like some of the activist movements it discusses, the book makes a passionate presentation of serious problems that should be addressed, but fails to propose viable and practicable solutions to these issues 
 You know how when a regular pick hits your strings, you can hear the sound of it hitting the string, then after it releases and the string reverberates you hear a note?  Well imagine hearing 15 picks hit the string before the string produces music.  And the 15 picks are made of coiled wire.    I can't imagine a worse sound or feeling.    
 Unless you are interested in reading one chapter after another plugging Bear Spray, don't waste your time.  The stories are all re-hashed versions of nearly identical situations; Man goes into the wilderness-Man sees bear-Man uses UDAP Bear Spray on bear-bear retreats.  This book is one long advertisement for UDAP!!  My book was actually misprinted, missing 50 pages right in the middle.  Initially I wanted to return my book for a complete one but, after reading the rest of 223 pages, I didn't want to waste any more of my time with this ONE story 
 Prince is Talented,though I can't remember when I last heard it because he has dropped plenty of wack Music for a really,really long time.in hindsight He is basically a Musical Version of Puffy.meaning while Prince can play,He ain't never done anything remotely Original.He was in the late 70's through the 80's a Poor Man's Michael Jackson.then fast forward to the 90's on this long-winded Album he was trying to Jack R.kelly's style.interesting irony is that Michael Jackson&R.kelly could do Prince's whole thing in there sleep,but when he tired to Emulate them He comes across even more Corny than He already is.He will touch the King of Pop MJ&the King of R&B R.Kelly so maybe in the future Prince will find some Originality??I doubt it.He just bites off everyone.wasted Talent 
 The original Wild Things; you know, the one that was a bona-fide guilty pleasure/lurid trashy thriller, has now spawned not one, but two direct to video sequels.  Wild Things 2 was a waste, and Wild Things 3 is no different.  The story, if you want to call it that, is practically a carbon copy of the previous films where two sexy girls are in the center of twists and turns with loads of cash and murder in the mix.  There's twists aplenty here, all of which are pretty much non-sensical, and they're actually pretty predictable.  Mortal Kombat's Linden Ashby, who was in Wild Things 2, returns as a clueless detective, and Starship Troopers' Dina Meyer is here as well, for no apparent reason.  The girls are hot, and the steamy scenes between them are better and hotter than in Wild Things 2, but nothing can save this from being another needless and pointless direct to video sequel.  Stick with the original Wild Things; it wasn't a masterpiece, but it was a fun trash-noir thriller that was actually memorable 
 For those of you who like mysteries that follow clues and have great detective work, this is not for you. Did not hold my attention and I forced myself to finish it. Maybe it's the psychic angle that I found unbelievable. Very predictable and people dying left and right with no time to follow a single clue, not that they looked for them anyways. 
 I have probably never seen a movie with quality as bad as this. Even my old tapes from TV were 500% better.  The picture was faded, the characters looked like they were 90 years old and the sound track was off so badly that it also garbled words, so looking away from the movie did not help.  It is also one hour long--but seemed like three-probably a copy of a TV movie as it also had cuts for commercials though I could not find any place that said this. It was advertised as a 2 Hour DVD-and it is--I guess, but I could not see any more of it.  At the end of one hour, it just showed credits and it was over. I am returning it-and it is the first copy of a DVD that I have ever returned for picture and sound quality 
 I got this book to cook a traditional Christmas dinner for my family and friends, and I was so disappointed. I would not recommend this book. The recipes were not great. The photographs can be very deceptive. The banana pudding was mere mush.The 'yassa' chicken was disappointing and not to mention demoralizing. As a black woman, I am trying to get away from the 'yess sah' notion. Go elsewhere for true Southern cooking. No wonder there are so many of her books in the 'used' section for under $6 
 I bought this book many years ago after buying Dougal Dixon's other two masterpieces, After Man and The New Dinosaurs. But reading THIS book made me sick to my stomach. The idea of using genetic engineering to turn future humans into animalistic creatures was literally an insult to my intelligence, and some of the creatures that are said to have evolved later were simply unscientific and implausible, such as the water seeker and the "memory people". Then aliens descended from humans that have escaped to another part of the galaxy return to Earth after 5 million years and wipe out nearly all creatures on Earth! After a few weeks, I literally threw this book away and my opinion of Mr. Dixon was lowered permenantly. Quite simply, he should never have written this nonsense! Being human himself, how could he have done this to his own species? 
 Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn. No other ballet partnership is as legendary -- the fiery Russian defector and the graceful, aging English ballerina formed a bond on and off the stage that for several years practically defined romantic ballet. Thus, for this very reason, hardcore balletomanes should get this dvd. Many of us (including me) were too young to have seen Nureyev and Fonteyn live, so these videos are the only example to dissect the legendary partnership.  However, caveat emptor: this is NOT a "typical" Swan Lake by any means. You can argue that there is no "typical" Swan Lake -- the original production in 1877 was a failure. Some of the music went missing. After Tchaikovksy's death, the choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov restaged Swan Lake, and that version more or less is the Swan Lake audiences know today. There's lots of music, so most versions of Swan Lake use the "traditional" pieces.   Nevertheless, there are some different traditions of Swan Lake. In the Russian productions, the outcome is usually "happy" -- Rothbart is killed, and Siegfried and Odette are alive. In the productions used "everywhere else," Odette and Siegfried leap into the lake, and are reunited in the otherworld. I prefer the second ending personally, because I think it better matches both the story (the happy ending was enforced by the Tsar, and seems tacked on), and the music as well.  Rudolf Nureyev's 1966 film, however, is unlike any other Swan Lake I've ever seen. First of all, from the opening closeup (of Siegfried in blue eyeshadow and red lipstick) you realize this film is not going to follow Balanchine (and classical ballet's) creed of "ballet is woman." The first act is redesigned to incorporate a lot of solos and dance opportunities for Siegfried (Nureyev). The first act usually ends with Siegfried picking up his bow and arrow and going hunting with Benno. In this film, there is a long elegiac solo for Siegfried (using music that's usually used in act 2).   Nureyev even dares to tinker with the famous Act II choreography by Lev Ivanov. In the famous Odette/Siegfried Adagio, the melody is not repeated with the cello -- instead, there's another solo for Siegfried. Margot Fonteyn was born in 1919 so it's possible that the emphasis on Nureyev is due to Fonteyn's technical limitations at the time. And one notices that Fonteyn, as graceful and lovely as she is, is at times unable to cope with the famously demanding Odette/Odile role. For instance, Odette's solo in Act II usually ends with a series of turns and then Odette stands on pointe and holds a balance before going into the wings. Fonteyn doesn't attempt the feat, but ends the series of turns in first position -- flat on her feet. Fonteyn by modern standards also lacks the athleticism, bonelessness (her arms always look like arms, not wings), flamboyance, and flexibility, that one usually associates with this role.  Act III's music choreography is pretty standard, but the musical arrangements (and choreography) for the Black Swan Pas de deux are radically different. Fonteyn actually churns out the fouettes, confirming something I've long suspected: that everyone looks at the fouettes, but Odette/Odile's real challenges are the balances, footwork, and leaps, and this is where you can see Fonteyn suffer.   Strangely, Act IV (the act that is usually cut to shreds) is the most intact. And it's the best-danced act: it;s the reconciliation scene between Odette and Siegfried that one can catch glimmers of the genuine bond that existed between these dancers. Elsewhere, the technical limitations of Fonteyn by this time and Nureyev's reworking of Swan Lake as a solo showpiece for Siegfried distracted me from simply enjoying their partnership. I particularly loved when Siegfried runs all over the stage, turning up the head of each swan, to find his Odette, and when he finally finds Margot's head, it's a truly beautiful moment. The ending of Nureyev's version follows the original Swan Lake, and not the "usual" endings of the Swan Boat to heaven.  On a technical level, there are problems. The ballet was filmed on a soundstage, and seems way too small to fit a whole cpmpany corps. As a result, the dancers often look haplessly cramped and as if they'll bump into each other. The close bunching also detracted from the natural geometric shapes that are so much a part of classical ballet. The Vienna State Ballet also looks woefully underreheased. Either that or they're just bad. Their legs are terribly uneven in arabesques, their arms are a mess, and they simply look like a corps that hasnt danced Swan Lake enough. The sets are also deliberately artificial and the costuming, espeically for Nureyev and in the "color" acts, is garish. Rothbart (Redbeard here) is a non-dancing role, unlike in most productions when he's a smooth pimp-type in Act III.   For a traditional Swan Lake with a more modern Odette/Odile, I'd suggest the Makarova/Dowell dvd with the Royal Ballet. Makarova was 41 at the time of filming, but her long extensions, boneless arms, exquisite balances, and still impressive technique make her Odette/Odile much more appealing to modern tastes. This Swan Lake is of great historical value, and Fonteyn is undeniably lovely, but overall I admit I wanted a more traditional Swan Lake, and I certainly wouldnt recommend this dvd as anyone's first Swan Lake. Its just too unorthodox.  
 I found this documentary left out some information about the Bush family that I thought would be included. The documentary did not cover George W. Bush's grandfather's working relationship with the Nazi party during the second world war. Nor did the doc spend much time on the rest of George's relatives and family members. The doc didn't include as much information as I thought that it would and the material that it covered has already been covered in other documentaries like Fahrenheit 9/11. The host of the documentary had to assert his fedora for no reason which was more distracting and annoying to see in what I expected to be a hard hitting, serious documentary 
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 This book is really a brief history of the ancient world. The first 94 pages have little to do with the Bible much less Bible archaeology. If you want a thumb nail sketch of the "Rise and Fall of the Assyrian Empire," or the  "Rise and Fall of the Chaldean Empire," or "Egypt prior to Abraham," you might like this book. Otherwise, you will be disappointed 
 I get it.  Sometimes it's hard, impossible, to break away from the dictums of society.  That doesn't stop this movie from being one of a handful of movies that make me wish film had never been invented 
 When I first bought this phone about six months ago, I thought I was getting a good deal, but I was wrong. The phone picked up a lot of static and the battery has a very short life, only a couple hours off the charger then it won't work 
 "Listen, Bunuel. What are we going to do? The witch has quit. Says: too much nudity. Who does she think she is - Mother Theresa?"  "I am a little busy, JP (Quiet, babe! Can't you see? I am talking to my producer here!). Just get another broad for the role: anybody, only with a good front."  "But, Maestro! We'd have to re-shoot half of the movie. Fernando is already talking of another engagement. In any event, with his rate if we use him again, it will be twenty years before we see any money from this flick. We might as well scrap the whole thing."  "Don't worry, JP. We'll keep shooting as if nothing happened. That's what being Great Director all about. They are morons, or why you think anyone would pay cash to see such garbage. Most won't even notice that the face is different, and those who do, will find a good explanation for it. Subliminal, surreal, existential, women are alike - all that nonsense, you know. Relax and have a drink." 
 Very bad purchase, I buy new DVD Panasonic in Amazon and when I arrive the reader from DVD not read any disc, none! i buys by Internet from Costa Rica and lost all the investment. Please no body buy this Model of Panasonic 
 This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.  It was agonizingly slow and it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I told myself that I would quit at page 100 if it didn't seem to go somewhere but I gave it another 50 pages because it was Stephen King.  It was brutal 
 I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money! 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 This album is a real let down and it pains me to say so, since I really do like the KOL. The first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked. I didn't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling. It didn't matter because the songs were great.But on this cd they've opted for an experimental sound that doesn't measure up. Innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in Charmer-what the heck is up with that? How often do you want to listen to it? Once was enough for me. I wasn't expecting the Pixies here. And then there's the reverb employed on song after song-why? It just degenerates into white noise. There are a couple of good tracks on the dics- Black Thumbnail, for one. But then there are throwaway tunes like Camaro, which is about as clique as you can get. That said, art is subjective, and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews. But I find most of it unlistenable.I can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating; this is definitely not one of them 
 Let me come straight to the point. This stuff is garbage. Please save your hard earned cash, and purchase something different. This does nothing to remove or repair scratches. If you want to waste 10 dollars, you can rip up a 10 dollar bill and flush it down the toilet. If I could rate this item as zero stars, then I would. 
 You're writing a poem or song. You've got one word, and want a rhyming word. So you need a rhyming dictionary.  Look up the word you know and find other rhyming words.  How simple does it get?  Well with this dictionary - forget it.  This is arranged NOT alphabetically by word, but by vowel "sound". They have transformed what should be a simple process into a chore.  
 This book didn't teach me anything I didn't already know.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 This charger first started out awesome and had no problems. Then after about 3 months it started to act up and now it wont charge my ipod at all. Find a better charger or you will be buying multiple chargers 
 To judge by the number of books by Karen Armstrong that you see on bookstore shelves, Armstrong's books are very popular.  If this book exemplifies her work, her popularity is not a good thing because she totally misleads her readers about the nature and history of Islam.  Almost at every turn in this book excuses are made, things are twisted, inconvenient facts are omitted, roadside signs are turned around and readers are deliberately pointed down the wrong road and towards the wrong conclusions.  Twenty three pages of included chronology lay out, in page after page, almost 1,400 years of bloody fighting for power and control among Muslim leaders, as well as the many conquests these leaders made of a large portion of the Earth inhabited by non-believers.   One howler in the chronology alone should alert any perceptive reader that this is a work of apology and fantasy, not history.  In her listing (p. xvi) for the pivotal 732 A.D. battle of  Tours (or Poitiers),  which halted major Muslim attempts to invade Europe until the first Siege of Vienna in 1529, she described Charles Martel as defeating "a small raiding party of Spanish Muslims."   Opinions among military historians differ but, the estimated numbers in this "small raiding party" range from 30,000 to 400,000 Muslim troops with the consensus number being 80,000.    I particularly like her characterization of this decisive battle in her later narrative on p. 50 when she writes that Westerners "...exaggerate the importance of this battle," that  "Arabs felt no compulsion to conquer western Christendom in the name of Islam." And that, anyway, "...Europe seemed remarkably unattractive to them, there were few opportunities for trade in that primitive backwater, little booty to be had and the climate was terrible."   I would say that a battle that halted Muslim attempts to invade Europe for almost a thousand years was "important." If Europe was so unattractive and there was no compulsion to "conquer it in the name of Islam" why the major Muslim attempts to do so in 723 A.D. in France, 1529 A.D. in Central Europe at the first Siege of Vienna, at the sea Battle of Lepanto in 1571 off the coast of Greece and again at the Battle of Vienna in 1683?  I also think that Muslim armies, per their usual routine of brutality, slaughter and looting, were not there at Tours to do some peaceful trading for native French pottery and jewelry.  Such travesties are to be found on almost every page. For example in her preface, p. xi, Armstrong writes that the Koran gave Muslims a "historical mission." " Their chief duty  was to create a just community in which all members, even the most weak and vulnerable, were treated with absolute respect."  Armstrong doesn't mention the death, destruction and slavery or dhimmitude that awaited non-believers who weren't members of this Muslim umma or community, in the formerly Christian countries that Muslim armies conquered.  Or take p. 16, "The emanicipation of women was a project dear to the Prophet's heart."   Or Armstrong's discussion  pp. 18-19 of Muhammad's two "most creative gestures."  One is redirecting the direction of prayers from Jerusalem to Mecca and the other? Why it was having his Muslim followers who emigrated from Mecca to Medina start raiding caravans to support themselves, raiding after all  "... was sort of a national sport in Arabia as well as a rough and ready means of redistributing resources in a land  where there was simply not enough to go around."  Next time a thug pushes a gun in your face and takes your jewelry and money, just think of it as "a rough and ready means of redistributing resources."  Says Armstrong of the triumph of Islam over the Arabian peninsula (p. 22), "Arabia was a chronically violent society and the umma had to fight its way to peace."  There are just too many examples of this sort of thing to go on but, if you want real history without a corrupting agenda, look elsewhere. 
 Sixty dollars spent for a new cover, some corrections in the index and a general increase in values is about all that is new in this edition.  If you have the older one, don't bother! I felt cheated 
 I have read a number of Steele's books over the years; this one was so bland, trite, and contained such bad writing I had to look at the cover repeatedly to establish it really was her book.  Sentence structure, content and story line all fall far below standards - did she have an editor at all who would tell her the truth?? The first person, third person, omnicient points of view vary from sentence to sentence; one minute you are in Peter's head, the next standing above the room commenting on what is happening.  I think the sentence that blew me apart was on page 106 (hardcover) where she states "He had an envelope full of money in his pocket with a hundred thousand dollars in it."  Well, we didn't think it was yen.  I don't know if I'll read any further, its taken all my patience to get this far..... 
    This book is more about cocktails and less about tapas. I was hoping for an interesting tapas, not so. Bewar 
 This, great band at one time had some good stuff first and second ones there best the rest is bad, But hey maybe this works for some people  what eve 
 It was revealed by GLORIA STEINEM, quite soon after the untimely death of JACCQULINE KENNEDY ONASSIS, that Ms. KENNEDY had, very quitely and unobtusively, been contributing substatial amounts of money to N.O.W. for many, many years.  Now, (!), most people would not have thought that Jackie -- glamourous, gracious, and perennially-on-the-best-dressed-lists Jackie -- would have been one to support a "right-on, with-it" and somewhat aggressive organization such as "N.O.W."....but you see, she probably was a "women's liberationist" from Day 1 of her life.  Born into the social strata that she had been, it would have been rather difficult for her to, say, join the protests of Ceasar Chauvez in the vegetable fields, or go marching with Martin Luther King.  Yet her heart -- as well as that of her husband's -- were in these places 100%!   What to do?  She found the best way, (for her), to contribute: maintain the "social" facade, increase her wealth.....and then, unobtrusively, give it to those causes in which she truly believed!   There are, indeed, far more than one way to "skin a cat"....and/or change society!  However, an extremely handsome, extremely intelligent young man of my own  acquaintance, who enjoys perfect health, had a perfect score on his SATs, who attended a top-40 private college, has a beautiful wife and precocious child, and probably a fantastic future ahead of him if he so wishes), once told me, "But no one has ever discouraged ME!"  Perhaps.  (Does he know, I wonder, that one of the women he, personally, admires LEAST, H.M. Queen Elizabeth II, once said, similarly, "But no one has ever discriminated against ME because I am a woman!")  Does he not realize, that there are SO many OTHER people in the world who are equally, (or even more) ambitious as he, who do NOT enjoy perfect health, did NOT, (due to circumstances beyond their control), graduate or even go to college, are NOT movie-star handome or beautiful, do NOT have many supportive relatives, (or perhaps none at all) -- and perhaps do not enjoy other advantages this young man hardly thinks about...perhaps not even owning a car.  Yet, they, too, may want to rise in life, and look about wildly for SOME way to advance themselves -- and perhaps, also, help others as well?  What can they do?  Robbing banks can get one into a lot of trouble....especially if one does not have a driver's licence and getaway car.  Working in a freak show, (there ARE some left), does not appeal to many proud people, (although one proud person---who DID work in a freak show, once said: "People come here and pay money to see me, I don't pay money to see them.  My job's OK with me!)  I suppose it's all how one views one's circumstances.   Hmmmm.....losing weight, having my hair done, and looking as well as I can?  Why not?  That's an almost-free road to almost anyone!  Become beautiful -- or at least as beautiful as I can!  Why not?????   I recently saw a TV report on three young women -- teen agers -- who have life-threatening illnesses. In the hospital as much -- - or more -- than they are out of it, each of the three qualified for the "Make-A-Wish" program.  And what was the wish these three young women had arrived at...each separately?  Their wish was to be a super-model for a day!  : )  : )  : )   Since each of the three had the same wish, they met, and went all together to the various places which would transform them into super-models for the day.  They also met and conversed with real models.  Is this wrong?  Body-image isn't everything,  (WHEN ONE BELIEVES THAT, IT'S A SICKNESS CALLED 'NARCISSISM'!)....but surely it has it's proper place.  Looking as good as one can helps to give a person a sense of self-respect!  And -- in  this admittedly imperfect world -- looking good CAN help one get ahead.  (If a pretty girl and a plain one both have the same qualifications for, say, a secretarial, (or any other) job....the pretty girl will probably get the job.  Why?  Because the employer will want to put on a "good face" for his business.  This is not to say that if a pretty girl does not groom herself well, that the plain one...who takes better care of herself...will probably get the job. For the same reason.  Because the employer wants to put on a "good face" for his business.  "Beauty is as beauty does", I suppose.  And no one proved this more than DIANA VREELAND herself.  Ms. Vreeland was NOT beautiful...in fact, her appearance verged on being just plain ugly....but she decided NOT to let this be a hindrance in her chosen profession.  She started and rose in it....and wound up as editor-in-chief of VOGUE Magazine for many years!!!!!!       I suppose what I'm arguing here for is the realistic discovery that yes, beauty DOES matter in today's world.  But trying to look as good as one can does N O T necessarily mean having a nose job or binding one's feet.  That is a personal decision each person has to make for one's self.  Looking as good as you can..and deriving confidence from this, is what counts.  And, (as was shown on an episode of "To Tell The Truth" several years ago), there is a young lady in India, who became a model....then used her earnings to open up her home to under-priviledged children.   Angelina Jolie has used her beauty and fame to help others as well.  The list of "beautiful people" doing good works is quite long.       And who would tell those three teen-age girls with life- threatening diseases that their "Make-A-Wish" desire to become super-models for a day is unrealistic, backward, and hedonistic? Not I.  Beauty makes people HAPPY!  And there is little enough happiness in the world as it is!       "Beauty for good".....for anyone who chooses it!......forever!!!!!! 
 I don't know how a movie with so much going on can actually put me to sleep.  Oh, yeah, because what was going on was not even the least bit interesting.  Now I was shocked the feel this way, especially since Will Smith alone can carry a movie, but this film proved to be too much for even 'the greatest' himself.  In the ninties it seemed as if Will Smith was on top of the box office with smash after smash (Independence Day, Men in Black) but Wild Wild West can't even come close to compairing with those two films.  Hey, at least the soundtrack is tight.  Anyways, Will Smith plays Jim West and Kevin Kline plays Gordon and the two of them are sent to find some torso of a man who has kidnapped the worlds top scientists so that he can build a weapon to take over the USA.  So in the course of two hours time you see wierd gagets and loose women and some metal spider things and towns are destroyed and Will Smith dresses up like a woman (the best scene in the film) and really...thats all...I mean, the film itself has no substance.  Another pitfall is the fact that this film can't save itself from being corny...really really corny.  It falls into the same catagory as 'Men In Black 2'...stupid.  The difference between films like this and Will Smith's more successful efforts (Men in Black and Hitch) is that the comedy in those films was smart, not stupid...and the comedy here is just an agrivance.  Skip this one...it's not worth the agrivation 
 Maybe someone should inform Vicente Fox.  It's amazing what liberals write these days.  And by the way, the Republicans and the Democrats are two sides of the same coin, two halves of the same party. They aren't that different. Both want massive immigration, both want America involved in wars all over the world, both want to move our jobs to foreign countries, both support the new multicultural society, both of them are chock full of people who marry across the race lines, neither really cares for religion (regardless of what the politicians say...I don't see the Republicans putting prayer back into the schools), both woefully disregard the Constitution, ad infinitum 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 This film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film, and has many flaws:  a silly plot, cheap religious imagery (Dracula is Judas, jeez louise), and not one truly sexy or scary moment. And it wastes three gorgeous gals as Dracula's brides, including Jennifer Esposito & Jeri Ryan. If you can't make a film sexy with these two, you're in the wrong business. Craven has an over inflated rep as a director, he doesn't deserve any rep as a producer, if this leaden film is a sample. It makes the worse Universal horror film look like Citizen Kane in comparison.  Save your money and pick up something scary instead, like Bava's Black Sunday or any Hammer horror 
 I LOVED what the CD had to say but the sound quality could have been a little better 
 I can only agree with the "common humanity" sentiments expressed- especially that feature of humans leading them to take the piss out of newcomers. Turbull utterly uncritically accepts what he is told. He takes a pygmy out onto the plain and drives him up to a Buffalo and the guy expresses surprise at Turnbull's ability to turn an insect (buffalo far away) into a large creature close up. Come off it! This pygmy hunts for food and can probably knock a monkey off a branch at 50 yards and he has no depth perception? He's having a laugh at Turnbulls expense! Read Chagnon on the tricks th Yanomamo used to play on him. A much better anthropologist and less patronising too 
 Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?  Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.  Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.  
 Someone should ask the author how much more successful the UN would be in it's role if the US and Israel weren't always vetoing it's resolutions to act. If the single most powerful nation on earth and it's little buddy completely ignore the UN, veto it's every attempt to act, and directly undermine it's authority in the world for 50 years, who's fault is it that the UN is unsuccessful? I firmly believe the US has a moral and ethical obligation to lead the world, and I firmly believe we can do it morally and ethically. However, writing history in such a way that the sins of the US and Israel aren't there won't make that happen. We need to know what once was in order to know what now is, and we need to know what now is in order to lead a better world 
 The book should be lsted as fiction, and not under history or theology. Mr. Kennedy should keep his act to the TV, where he can present baseless facts. His subjective biased argument does not help in promoting christanity, a more obejective would. "A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom" by ANDREW DICKSON WHITE does a far better job in presenting an objective analysis on impact of christanity on science. Struggle of Gallileo with the chruch is complete mis-presented by Mr. Kennedy 
 If you are interested n this type of story, buy To Sir With Love or Boys Town instead. Dangerous Minds is simply boring and predictable with nothing to make it memorable. There are a couple of decent performances from some of the minor characters but that's not enough to raise it above the sad script and cliche ridden dialogue.  On the other hand, if you have no life experience, are very young or simply have watched very few movies in your life, you might get some enjoyment out of this. It's not really a bad movie, but it's certainly not a good one 
 Poor grammar is the bane of this otherwise fine exploration of love and  loss 
 The wood is very nice - but the design/ manufacturing is very poor.  My experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating.  The holes aren't properly pre-drilled.  The hole at the top didn't match up with the cap-plate hole, which A) made it very difficult to screw together (the first screw stripped) and B) resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly.  I experienced the same issue with shallow pre-drilled holes in the bottom, and the bolts not going in all the way.   I never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions.  Based on the wobbly central column, I decided to disassemble mine and send it back. 
 If you like action flicks with absolutely no intelligence this movie will appeal to your deepest of hearts, but for those of you who prefer a plot and something that makes at least a little sense....skip it.  A sports camera crew sets out to find the most daring of extreme sports heroes so that it can film an action movie in the Alps. They recruit a couple of crazy snow-boarders, helicopter pilots willing to outrun avalanches and then they toss in a pretty and dainty Olympic skier for good measure and some eye candy. The entire film consists of the frilly skier competing with the fearless snow boarders for attention and film time. They get thrown out of helicopters at high altitude without any oxygen and wearing barely any clothes but they never freeze...funny how that happens in movies! The real amazing feat is how they ski downhill in front of a major avalanche and can still talk to one another...have you ever heard how loud an avalanche is? Thank goodness for those sub-atomic hearing aids!! Eventually European terrorists enter the picture and a few automatic weapons (something has to encourage those slow moving avalanches). Well you know how it goes.  The action is great and if you like skiing some of the stunts are literally unbelievable but other than that I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone with half a brain because you will just be frustrated with all of the impossibilities and missed reasons for people to die. I only watched it because I was forced into it by a couch potato with a remote.   
 We had high aspirations and scrupulously read this book looking for guidance, all to no avail. This book contains incorrect and misleading information. We tried the various links for additional data many of which were no longer on the web. Others that we contacted via e-mail the response was not what was designated in the book. Peter and Tara provide their e-mail addresses, but they neither respond nor answer questions. The only conclusion that one can draw is that they crank out the books just to sell them and make a quick dollar. They don't really intend to be there for the consumer.    We have since spoken with others who purchased the book and they were also disgusted and very disappointed. This book was a total waste of money. The only thing that it is good for is the garbage or fireplace 
 Uhhh, puh-lease. Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away. I had to read this book for school. It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog. They lose the dog. They are sad. They can't figure out who took the dog. The dog comes back. Whoop-dee-doo. End. Ya see? I could have written this book better. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!! EVER!! 
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 I was very pleased to finally acquire this book, having heard of it several years ago. Although I'm not an expert in history, I have read a lot of books concerning this period, and always look forward to reading more. My pleasure soon turned to dismay as I started reading. Through the first few chapters I had a growing but unspecific feeling of unease - something about the prose didn't ring true. It was nothing I could put my finger on; aspects of the writing didn't feel authentic.  I persevered. Eventually I stumbled across details that I knew were wrong. For instance, in this period the term "Your Majesty" to address the King or Queen had not yet been introduced. This didn't come about until the time of the Tudors. Plantagenet monarchs were content to be addressed as "Your Grace". Next, Edward IV was several times described as wearing a collar of interlinked S's. Unlikely. Yorkist collars tended to consist of roses and suns - the interlinked S collars were favoured by the Lancastrian nobility. Then in book 2 of the series we were asked to believe there was a Jewish money-lender in Whitby. As this story is set slap bang in the middle of the three hundred and fifty year period during which all Jews were banned from England, I find this hard to believe. Book 3 (which I've read, living as I do outside the US) would have us believe a crescent moon sailed the sky for an entire night. I ask "On which planet?!" A crescent moon when new is seen only at the start of the night, and when waning is only seen in the hours before dawn. The only moon that is seen all night is a full moon.  These known inaccuracies ruined the book for me. I found myself questioning every detail I read. Was it true? Was it authentic? Or was it just a flight of fancy or wishful thinking on behalf of the author? In the end I was unable to finish the 3rd book in the series because I found myself irritated to the point that I no longer cared about the fates of the characters. I'm only grateful that I got the books out of the library rather than spending hard earned cash on them.   I'm left wondering how such glaring errors could make their way into a published book...or am I expecting too much that a work of historical fiction should reflect its setting accurately 
 A patchwork of history, fiction and feminist commentary, Sontag's novel falls short in virtually every category.   The title of the book is misleading as well. This was neither the story of a volcano lover nor the narrative of a collector. It was a somewhat fractured portrait of the volcano lover's wives.   Sontag hasn't done an especially good job with character development either. Farting kings, eccentric aristocrats and bloated women jump from the pages as caricatures rather than fully developed characters.   Lord Nelson, a principal figure in the book, is never actually named, but simply referred to as "the hero." A device that falls rather flat in what tends to be a rather tedious read.  As historical fiction, Madison Smartt Bell's Haitian trilogy is far superior to Sontag's novel. And her feminist spin on a bygone era falls considerably short of Michel Faber's "The Crimson Petal and the White."  The 1,500-page-plus trilogy and 800-page-plus Faber novel by the way are quicker, more compelling reads than Sontag's much shorter, but much more boring and disjointed "romance."  Punctuation and the lack of quotation marks would be the very least of my concerns about this particular book. After all, if we can get through Ulysses or Finnegan's Wake, Sontag's fiction by comparison would qualify an easy read. No...there's much more missing here than quotation marks.  
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 The plot of the story is Ludlum all the way, but the narrative is no where near Ludlum. I am having a hard time getting through it. Will probably give up before half way 
 I can not believe that this debate is going on.  These zealots need to climb out from under their rock and step into the real world.  Hello, FICTION.  You, people, do remember the word, I hope.  The Harry Potter series is wonderfully written and opens up the imagination and gets the kids out from the television and video games.  Come on people, kids are only kids once.  God isn't going to strike you dead for reading them and the devil isn't going to invade your children for reading them either.  Get over this stupid idotic idea that this is unholy 
 it is a good toy but the balls are rather small and youmust check the seams when they arrive for poor sowin 
 I had heard all the hype about this film and Ginger's Oscar, but after several viewings, I still find the film rather flat as an experience, and Ginger's Oscar is still a mystery.  I guess it proves the adage about winning one "For women, play plain or ugly (remember Charlize Theron) or play against type" 
 I really like Levine's book Ella Enchanted. But I would not recommend The Wish for adults, let alone children. It is too vulgar 
 Superman is vacationing on New Genesis.  Darkseid captures a spacecraft that passes too close to Apokalips.  While Superman enjoys not having to rescue anyone, Darkseid discovers the aliens and hatches a plan against New Genesis.  Soon New Genesis is under attack from Parademons.  As Superman and the New Gods fight them off, they are astounded when the attackers suddenly stop and aliens burst out of their chests.  Superman goes into a rage while the New Gods try to stop the flood of aliens.  Then Superman and Orion take the fight to Darkseid and the Alien queen.  I have never been a fan of the Darkseid or New Gods stories (they should have been wiped out in the Crisis) and this one is not much better.  Since this is not an Elseworlds tale, there is not a lot of room for maneuvering in the plot.  Needless to say it is a minor skirmish in the great war between the two worlds (as they all are).  I was surprised at Superman's vacation attitude.  It is not explained why he is there but he seems completely unconcerned about anything that mike be happening in his absence.  There was also the gratuitous "Big Barda strolling in her Bikini" scene that was followed by Orion posing in his briefs.   I felt the Aliens were not handled well either.  There is no menace, only one scene of stalking, and the resolution was unresolved.  Barda got away from the aliens on New Genesis but were they stopped?  No one bothered to check.  Darkseid seemed very careless about breeding face-huggers and chest-bursters.  There are scenes on Apokalips that shown many aliens have burst forth but the story does not account for any of them.  All in all this was a disappointment 
  The book is beautiful, no doubt. The figures and summury tables are great. However, the book lacked clarity (in my opinion at least). Comparing it to books like Lathi's Modern Communication Systems and Dorf's Modern Control Systems, it really fails in motivating the equations and mathematical derivations. Lots of very important formulas and conclusions just seem to pop-up.   Most of the excersises were also very difficult to understand in light of the given information in the text.  I recall reading the never-ending pages in the physics of BJTs with hardly a clue to what really was going on. Most of the other students merely jumped to the modeled equations  and didn't bother at all with the underlying physics.  To be fare though I must say I didn't read any other book on general electronics (we moved on to specialized courses in intstrumentation)so the book might be a lot better then others 
 THERE ARE PLENTY OF WORDS I COULD USE TO DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM BUT LETS JUST PUT IT THIS WAY: I DOWNLOADED THIS ALBUM, YES FOR FREE, FREE!!! AND DIDNT EVEN BOTHER BURNING IT I DELTED IT RIGHT OFF MY COMPUTER. AMAZINGLY BA 
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 Jill McCorkle seems to be trying too hard to be unique and quirky just for the sake of being "original." I was attracted to this book because I like fiction written from the point of view of many characters, but "Carolina Moon" was an amalgam of too many different styles that just wouldn't blend. We have letters, we have third person narration, and we have first person narration in the form of an annoying young woman talking to a tape recorder diary. Too much.  This last narration bothered me because the woman didn't sound like she was talking to a tape recorder - the voice sounds more like a written voice. For example, she barely distinguishes who's speaking, which is fine on the page where you can see indents and paragraphs and quotation marks, but as a spoken voice it didn't work. She didn't sound like a real person. The point of having someone tell his or her story through a tape recorder diary is to capture his/her voice more naturally. McCorkle just tells the story this way because it's "neat." The character doesn't sound any different from any of the other characters - and her story is pointless and contributes nothing to the plot or sublot or second subplot.  Quee was just plain annoying. She's an old, quirky prostitute medicine woman who collects pictures of people she doesn't know and makes stories up about them. She was quirky and had a quirky perspective on morals, so we're supposed to like her. I hated her. I'm tired of fiction about crazy, quirky people trying to force their agendas down our throats. The best novel I've read about a quirky person was "A Separate Peace" because the narrator in that novel gets just as annoyed at the quirky character as the reader. (And he pushes him out of a tree.) Read that book instead.  I think McCorkle may just have been suffering from some quirkiness herself when she wrote this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the stories are bland. There's no reason for the unnamed woman to drop letters to her dead lover in the mailbox except to advance the story. And the only purpose the mailman has is to read the letters to us. The characters are more like the author's pawns than real people. The book didn't really seem to be about anything, and the ending was unbelievable (in a bad way, not a good way). I was surprised because McCorkle is usually a very good character writer. Her short story "Intervention" is a marvelous story about a woman torn between her alcoholic husband and her children, who wish to have an intervention. Great character in that story. I'd recommend reading McCorkle's short stories instead of "Carolina Moon." 
 I ordered this for my father, and according to him, there was only one disk in the package.  Very disappointing.  He didn't want to bother with sending it back.  
 A rambling, boring plot; major characters that aren't remotely plausible; potentially interesting characters that make a brief appearance only to be killed off; major plot elements that aren't really resolved - all this and more in what must be one of the most poorly written books I've read in the last decade.  Don't waste your time on this stinker 
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 This book as really good basic information, although most of the other information is obsolete.  Most texture artist(new or vetran) have surpassed this technology long ago.  It's great read for the basics, but beyond that, their are better books 
 I like this author, but this story falls apart under the weight of a not too well thought out mystery. Plus the characters are so diverse it seems impossible that they would be in the same story, and have no conflict 
 As a seasoned sales professional coming from a lightly technical background, I had hoped that this book (although targeted to technical folks in a light selling capacity) would provide some insight divergent from a traditional industry. As such, it completely missed the mark. Indeed, I am not sure that it would be well worth it for its intended audience. It is not at all useful in 'making' the technical sale in the least. However, it might serve a purpose for engineers and other technical types in understanding the business component of their respective industry. With some modification to the text, I would retitle the book, 'Why do sales and business people do that?'.   
 I don't really care whether the book is "true" or not--although I doubt it is.  But despite a few well written sentences here and there, the stories are boring, the characters unsympathetic, and the setting mundane.  I'm not sure what all the hubbub is about.  There are tons of better books out there.  I don't recommend this one 
 Being new to the Triangle area, I was excited to read about the storied history of the Duke-Carolina rivalry in an unbiased fashion.  In reading Mr. Chansky's book, its clear where his loyalties lie.  His text is weaved with snide comments about Coach K and the Duke athletic and academic program, while at the same time lionizing Coach Smith the the UNC progam.  Don't be fooled: this is not an unbiased portrayal of Duke-Carolina.   Chansky's book could also have benefited from better editing.  He spends single paragraphs describing some of the most thrilling Duke-Carolina games, but then rambles on for pages about inconsequential stuff, such as CD Chesley's TV deals or Coach K's American Express commercials (an obvious sore point for Chansky).    I wouldn't recommend this book.  Probably a better read would be "To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever" since its at least honest about its affliation and more entertaining.  
 This book is a fabrication. If you want a 19th American updating of the Israelite story, help yourself. Just don't take it seriously 
 The Great Wave is what results when someone who does not have any understanding of economics writes economic history.      The author's attempt to equate increases in prices due to catastrophic harvests or plague three to five hundreds years ago with the increase in general prices during the twentieth century to an expansionary monetary policy manages to, at once, understate what has been best about human progress and overstate what has been worst about it. 
 This book was boring.  I read it for a book club, and it has been the only book so far that I was tempted not to read.  
 I think this book is worse than the others written by Savage-Weiner, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately, most reviewers never bothered reading this book.  On page 2, I am reminded why I hate this guy. Observing "while I'm no military tactician," he forgets to point out he was dodging the draft picking flowers in Hawaii while I and others were serving in Vietnam. He then states, "we still had to fight the real war, a guerrilla war--something our nation does not have the stomach for." Oh, please dude, people like you and your followers don't have the guts to serve. Like on page 10, where he forgets that people like Ted Kennedy at least served in the Navy during WWII. You may disagree with his politics, but at least the Kennedys had the guts to serve.  Skip ahead to page 172 (you ain't missing much) for more of his idiocy on Vietnam. He states, about the Vietnamese, that "in the sixties, no one really knew who they were." Well, he didn't, but 3 million Americans who served in the Vietnam War did. That's what happens when you sit out the war of your generation. He also erroneously claims that Vietnam "was a civil war." At the time of the war it was considered communist aggression. Conservatives of the sixties, like me but not him, knew about the communist threat. This is also the same page where Savage-Weiner claims "Iraq was not a civil war." Where have you been lately?  The "Afterword" really says it all. On page 203 he claims, about liberals, "for far too long you have lived in a cage where liberal ideas--and only liberal ideas--are expressed." He is really talking about himself and his followers. At least liberals, by definition, read and review all points.   For all those who hate "liberals," I would like to remind them that our Founding Fathers were the liberals of their day. A real Patriot of our Revolution (one of my real ancestors in Virginia) would have burned his house down and sent him packing on his big honking yacht.   
 this is an amazing book. buy it right now. however, i would not recommend the paperback edition. it is binded with very inferior glue; two days after i recieved it, the cover had fallen off, and as i read it (quite quickly i might add, as i could not put it down) the pages were literally falling out one by one. i'm not sure if anyone else has had this problem with the paperback, but i can assure you that you're going to want to have this book for a while, so just buy the hardcover 
 Instead of a testament to his climbing expeditions, this book might best serve as a testament to what seems to be Jim Wickwire's blatant misogyny and egocentrism.  After detailing how he decided his wife should leave college to support him, Wickwire regales us semi-boastfully with anecdotes relating how he expected his wife to be nothing more than a housekeeper, child-rearer, and "sex object" (his words).  After insisting on a large family, and getting offended at a well-meaning priest who gently suggested birth control, Wickwire  (by his own admission) proceeds to by-and-large shirk his duties as a father to all five of his children, supporting them only in the economic sense.    We then get to read his thoughts about the innate subordinism of female climbers, and their tendency toward sexual hijinks on the mountains.  The brunt of Wickwire's finger-pointing rests solidly on the shoulders of the female climbers he discusses, until he falls "in love" with Marty Hoey, a talented female climber with the sense, it seems, never to have gotten seriously involved with Wickwire, despite his attempts to the contrary.  Wickwire seems to read much into incidents like feet (separated by different sleeping bags) accidentally touching in a overcrowded tent.  After the reader is forced to endure reading a series of desperate, petulant, and adolescent notes and conversations directed from Wickwire to Hoey, he recounts her death on Everest perfunctorily, for the most part, and in terms of how his wife forgave him for this one-sided indiscretion. All things considered, I'm not sure who should be more outraged: Mary Lou Wickwire, reading her husband's embarassing account of "falling in love" with Hoey (and knowing all her friends and peers will be reading it too), or Marty Hoey herself, to whom Wickwire attributes a number of childish and maudlin love notes, and who is no longer here to defend herself.  To be fair, Wickwire may not be the narrow-minded boor he appears to be as when, in 1985, he sadly acknowledges of the inevitable entry of women into the legal profession (one wonders what rock he was living under, or climbing over, not to know that women entered the legal profession long before then).  The book, while also hampered by a ridiculous title, is full of stilted prose and dialogue.  In Wickwire's world, climbers never say things like "We've gotta get down the mountain, fast." Instead, they make proclamations like, "We must descend quickly, or we shall perish upon the mountain." If they were climbing in King Arthur's time, maybe; in this day and age, no one speaks like that.  As a result, the dialogue sounds stilted and fictitious, even if it had a basis in fact.  The prose lingers too long, and clumsily,  on Wickwire's relationships with those around him, even though his relationships seem rather shallow.  Again, this may be the fault of the co-writer or the source, one never knows.  I would heartily recommend saving your money and time, and reading a more climbing-related and less self-centered and angsty text 
  It's the polar opposite of good writing.  It's so familiar, so conversational, so unturgid, and so padded with fluffy stuff it's unreadable.  Even worse than I figured it would be.  Oh, well, now i know after wondering all these years. 
 Been using it everyday for a month and it's hard to tell if it even did anything. Still have a lot of the same blueish black under my eyes that I've had my whole adult life.  A plus is it's easy to apply. Doesn't sting too bad if it gets in your eyeball either 
 I'll preface this by saying that I'm a university teacher who cares deeply about teaching, which I guess must be why this book was recommended to me in the first place. The early chapters I found simply intolerable, heavily reliant on unexamined truistic claptrap about self-knowledge, the soul, etc, etc. The whole book is overwritten and florid, like the inside of a greetings card. It is hard to be genuinely profound in that sort of prose, and I wished that Parker, who is clearly a wonderful and thoughtful teacher, had had the courage to write in something approximating the language of normal speech.  I said the book gets better as it goes: the chapter on subject-centered learning is absolutely first-rate, if you make it that far 
 When I read the NYTimes review of this book I bought it with anxious anticipation.  After all, years ago I had absolutely loved Rene Dubos' "The Mirage of Health".  However, this book was like wading through knee deep mud.  So much for the book reviews in the papers.  I know it is a gargantuan task, but someone needs to write a really interesting, flowing, readable book (or a series of books) about this fascinating subject.  I also realize that much about this subject is unknown or speculation, but still.. 
  This movie is the BIG LIE logic attempting to prove itself again.  Most despotic criminals use a BIG LIE concept to manipulate those in society with the weakest minds a lame too often used mold from which Stan "Tookie" Williams is cut.  This DVD is nothing more than a BIG LIE! that ranks right up there with NAZI BIG LIE era Triumph Of The Will.  Like any monster Tookie spent his life hating the nasty reprobate aspects that defined his hearts core while hurting others to cover up the fact he lacked strength to confront and overcome demons who likely at birth began consuming his black heart.  This DVD should be brought so you can look directly into the face of a demon and see how BIG LIES told on a grand scale can most effectively prevert truth beyond recognition infecting minds hearts and souls.  Even if Stan Tookie" Williams is just responsible for "Helping Create" the Crips gang that in itself is enough to earn him the one way trip on the needle express in my book.  That he writes a few lame anti-gang kiddie books and played his con-game to perfection on 60 Minutes, "convicing soft headed bleeding heart liberals that he is, redeemed" is of no consequence whatsoever.  Tookie was a heartless murderer of whole neighborhoods.  Tookie by helping create his gang murdered the dreams of countless thousands of innocent children made victims of drive by shootings.  Tookie helped to utterly destroy thousands of urban inner city poor families usually those most ill prepared for the assult he used to lay waste what little they had.  Tookie raped minds and whole communities holding each hostage at gun point to his perverted twisted desires and whims and a few good deeds no matter how heartfelt do not de-fang this monster of the first order.  Tookie Williams was nothing more than a domestic terrorist superimposed on a gangsta thug dope dealer's reality.  In the end Tookie Williams got what he deserved a needle ride to Hell's Gate if there is any enternal justice.  Buy this Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story DVD if you want to see the modern day media formula for exploiting weak minds at work.  I look at Stan Tookie William's and all I see is just another a weak minded pathetic monster who underwent his "caged creep conversion" but in truth the gang of thugs he spawned go on their merry murderous way.  When I saw this DVD on Stan "Tookie" Williams he reminded me of Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts who like the crips were just gangs of common thugs who murdered as much for fun as profit.)  This is a good DVD because Jamie Foxx captured the heart and soul of what it means to be an unrepentant psychopathic, self absorbed social parasite in Redemption - The Stan "Tookie" Williams Story.  If Tookie gets a Nobel Prize I think he should be forced to share it with Ernst Rohm) (1887-1934), German army officer and Nazi official who founded the SA (Brown Shirts) as they were in essentially the same business of neighborhood destruction, child killing, weak mind exploitation and death for fun or profit 
 It would have been ok if the author at least proved or used reasoning to back up some of the bold assumptions. He does not.   Hyatt believes that quoting famous philosophers will make his book look more intelligent. He also claims to posess a Ph.d (which I strongly doubt he has).  This book is not philosophy, not psychology. It is pure nonsense and assumptions about the world. Hyatt made sure to include occult stuff like the tree of life, and "magick" to make more people think it was cool. The title might look cool. Thats it.  You might get disappointed if you already bought "the psychopath's bible" by same author, because he is reusing a lot of the pictures.  Page 27-64 out of 224 pages (16.5%), contains a list of statements the author believes is lies. He wants you to use it to test yourself. Nothing wrong with the idea, but could be a trick to make the book look larger 
 Love Felcity Kendal in Good Neighbors, but this mystery stuff doesn't cut it plot wis 
 This book is by far the most self-serving example of literature I have ever come in contact with. Are we really to believe that Pleiadian beings used the author to write this book, and that they somehow are these benevolent creatures out to help us - to save us from ourselves?  Where is skepticism in all of this, where is rationale? Are we naive enough to simply take all of this in without question? Come on now 
 When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting "customers"(read victims) 
 The snap on the Leapers "Elite" Drop Leg Holster (the term Elite must be used loosely) would never stay attached. It would always either unsnap or come loose at the back. Eventually it fell off in the field and I lost it. The straps would never stay securely in the place I positioned them.   The Leapers Deluxe Drop Leg Holster is much more effective. Even w/ one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place. The method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well. Spend a few more dollars for the Deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the Elite 
 I remember Christmas a couple years back, when I saw a CD wrapped under the tree. Hoping it would either be by the Beatles or a computer game, I eagerly unwrapped it. I thought, oh no not pop music, but gave it a chance anyway. I'm sorry I did. The first three songs are all raps, and you know my feelings toward rap (If you don't, I hate it.) Hot In Herre is on my list of overrated songs, although Weird Al's parody, Trash, is hilarious. A bunch of boring songs, then Landslide, which is okay...more boring songs...No Doubt? Dear God, don't let them hurt me! More boring songs...hey, Hero, that's good, Don't Know Why is too. More boring songs...In My Place, that one's good...more boring songs...ONE LAST BREATH? MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!! Don't buy this. 
 I've had this radio for a year. Good retro looking, good sound. But all those people who call it's reception excellent must be on something. The FM reception is only OK, and the AM is just not working. It's not whether the signal is strong or weak - it doesn't matter. The engineering of this part of Model One is thoroughly screwed. 
 As to the best of my knowledge, there were two major intellectual responses to the seemingly endless and insuperable crisis which the capitalist system had got itself into after the Great Slump of 1929: Keynes`s "General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment" of 1936 and Schumpeter`s "Capitalism" which was first published in 1942. Like Marx before them, both Keynes and Schumpeter reject the "classic economists'" contention that what they called the market system wll always automatically swing back to an ideal equilibrium - expecially one that implied full employment - provided only the state kept its hands off as much as possible.   However, that is just about where their concurrence ends. While Marx sees the only solution outside the system, in its bloody overthrow and its succession by a "dictatorship of the proletariat" introducing the next evolutionary step in human history, called socialism, Keynes considered the market system as basically viable. All that was needed, according to him, was governmental involvement by which the lacking demand in times of a slump would be lifted to more agreeable levels. Schumpeter, in contrast, agrees with Marx in that capitalism's days are counted and that it is about to be replaced by socialism, even though he doesn't share Marx`s more aggressive notions: according to him, the present day capitalists need not be dealt with by the guillotine alone, they may indeed have a useful function as entrepreneurs employed by his envisaged omnipotent and omniscient super agency that will ideally plan everybody's well-being in his imagined socialist system.  What to think of the book today? First, it is hard to fathom how Schumpeter could have turned such an absolutely blind eye on the totalitarian tendencies necessarily inherent in a state that not only controlled the political field but also was quasi the monopolist employer and as such responsible for the economic side of peoples's lives as well, in particular when one considers the time when it came out: 1942! Second, it is a fine example of how wrong you can get things even if (or: because?) you know so much as Schumpeter did - maybe that is the best argument of all against the establishment of such a super agency planning everybody's life to the extent envisaged by Schumpeter. Finally, even if such an agency did not err - is it not a basic right - and half of the fun of life - to make mistakes - for oneself that is, not forcing them on others 
 I feel happy that tv series that I watched many years ago .  Now I can get them in DVD, but these serios were no popular just in USA in other countries of Latin America was popular too.  It should be make in Spanish too or with subtitles in several languages.  Thank 
 A Shameful Translation  This volume is quite possibly the sloppiest, most disrespectful, and least reliable "translation" of Rilke I have ever seen.   The term "translation" can only be used in the most casual sense for in their notes on translation Barrows and Macy describe a kind of vague new-age method of translation consisting of a kind of collaboration between them and the original, full of interpretation and subjectivity (pg. 35).   At one point they even confess to doing away entirely with the accurate translation of one of the poems in favour of a "metaphorical" translation (pg. 40).   They admit to omitting lines, entire sections of poems, and even collapsing two consecutive poems into one (pg. 41).   Any legitimate and reputable translator would be horrified by these hackneyed techniques.  For example, in the very first poem, one which sets the tone for the whole book, Barrows and Macy, in their foot notes, admit to cutting out the entire last stanza, fully one-third of the first poem because, "it is not as strong as the first two stanzas, especially for the opening poem of The Book of Hours."   Rilke, his editor, and his publisher obviously thought it was strong enough.    The fact of the matter is that Rilke's work is what it is and it is not the translator's place, as any reputable translator knows full well, to make those determinations.   On page 42 of their notes on translation, commenting further on Rilke's supposedly weak writing, they smugly comment, "Since we could not bring him the chicken soup he needed on those long nights [of writing], we have done him the favour of culling."   One wishes they had done him the favour of a reliable and reputable translation instead of rewriting his beautiful and thoughtful original.    
 The attachment isn't textured enough to stay where I put it. As I ride the entire assembly slowly spins around the handle under my hand 
   Look, let me say from the top I am not one of those bible-thumpers with a persecution complex (like my friend down below here who's ascribed Harris to hell... please don't think I'm like him.)  I did not take a secular class on biblical literature to have my beliefs confirmed.  I specifically took it because I wanted to hear secular viewpoints and glean knowledge and interpretations that I might not find at a biased church bible study group.  I fully expect - and *want* - college classes on religion to be secular, unemotional, scientific, and non-evangelical.  I can go to church to get religious teaching; I can go to school to learn about history and literature.   That said, this book... not so hot.  Not because my God is disrespected, but because Harris is not scientific enough.  Often times when he states an opinion, even when it has positively zero facts, evidence, or even hints supporting it, he states it as an absolute actuality rather than as a possibility.  Often times he just gets things dead wrong.  Here's a little example, although there are many: in the chapter on the book of Esther, he says that "Mordecai... manuevers events so that his beautiful cousin Esther, whom he has adopted (Esther 2:7) becomes queen."  There is nil even suggesting that Mordecai did so in the text.  Go read the book of Esther, it'll only take you a half hour; you'll find nothing to that effect.  Harris doesn't present this as a possibility, he presents it as a fact, and doesn't even bother to support the statement.  We're just supposed to buy whatever he says.   In a similar vein, he rarely considers multiple viewpoints.  Sticking with the Esther chapter (for sake of continuity) he proclaims Esther as a "patriotic fiction."  He sites the fact that two main characters, the queens Vashti and Esther, are not listed in any other documentation besides this book, so therefore they must not exist.  Never does he mention that the Hebrew word for "queen" might also translate "head wife", a status among swarms of other wives that did not mean either of these women were co-rulers and therefore would have any special place in the annals of Persian history (and besides, who says we've *found* all the annals of Persian history?  It's been thousands of years!  Isn't it reasonable to assume that a couple of books went missing?)  He says that one of the main characters, Mordecai, is said to have been deported to Persia from Babylon -- except, he says, the exile was at least a hundred years previous, making Mordecai and Esther too old to be alive at this point.  Again, he ignores the wording in Esther 2:6 in which Mordecai is said to have been carried away into exile... his ancestors are simultaneously listed in the same breath, making it unclear who the verb for "had been carried away" is being applied to-- Mordecai or his ancestors.  Thus, it's possible (note I am not so narcissistic as to present *my* opinion as fact) Mordecai is actually presented as a close ancestor to those who have been carried away.     I could go on.  The point is, Harris does this a lot.  He takes only one historical perspective when other perfectly intelligent, viable, and even secular but less negative viewpoints are easily available if he only bothered to search a little deeper... or even just read the text.  I don't expect him to list all of the many, many interpretations and possibilities; of course this would make the text far too expansive.  But I think it's reasonable to expect him to do his homework and offer up at least a some variation in his persepctives considering this is a textbook for a college course.  Try to be a little more even-handed when you write another one, Harris 
 http://www.voxfux.com/features/cia_murder.html  Interesting individual writing this book...  accused of murder, cocaine dealing, CIA training... Google 'Richard Bandler criminal past.' Aside from that, these books are great at teaching mind manipulation - of yourself and others.  Proceed.. with caution. 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 If you are looking for codes like Game Shark had, this is not for you.  Not only do you HAVE to have a computer, If anything happens to the disk, you are screwed.  You won't be able reinstall windows, or install it on a new computer.  Some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for %100 completion.  So if those are they games you plan on using,  this is the best thing out there 
 Once again Wiesel completes another masterly, tear-jerking hoax. How much longer can this phoney get away with it 
 Had the original Toshiba until it died ; no longer is that one made. We  bought the ugly round Cuisinart, which lasted for 5 years until it just quit working. Way too expensive to pack it up for repair, so we decided to try this attractive chrome job :(it is difficult to clean, often drips and  is altogether  unreliable. Because it has a thermal carafe, I expected it to keep coffee hot for more than one hour, but no luck. So I have to force open the lid right after brewing (apparently is gets vapor lock) and transfer contents to another thermos. I am on the prowl for another grind and brew (probably a Melitta)and ran across this opportunity to review this ill designed  Cuisinart, so decided to save some other folks the grief we have had with it. Only get one if somebody promises to pay you to use it 
 These do work great for organizing CDs and DVDs, and I do still use them, but I found that the two inside CDs/DVDs can become scratched by a small plastic ridge that runs down the middle of the page. I kept my TV DVDs in these pages for awhile, and discovered that all the discs on the inside of the pages had been scratched along this ridge. A few of my Simpsons discs still won't play certain episodes. So I keep all the discs on the outside slots only, and I've never had another problem with them. I use the inside slots for liner notes/episode lists, though I usually have to trim them to make them fit right 
 I was looking for a book that discussed the milk controversy in depth. I found this book to be silly and a waste of my time and money. If you are looking for a well-researched discussion on this topic, read The China Study 
 This book is not about how to do yoga. It is not for a beginning yoga student. It is probably of interest more to the yogini who has been practicing for some time and is now pregnant. It may be of interest to Iyengar followers as the photos are all of Iyengar's daughter when she was days before delivering her boy. This is a philosphy book, not a how-to book. The prose is spaced more like poetry so there isn't a lot of content in this book 
 Its light was okay, although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book. The main problem is it's too shabby to survive a battery change--so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out. Also, finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy. 
 *  Thanks, everybody! Due in large part to your reviews I have decided to heed your warnings and skip past this "turkey"! Because of your "common consensus," as it were, "curiousity" will by no means kill THIS particular "cat"!   Yes, I felt the very powerful urge to experience this version of "WotW," especially after (1)- hearing repeatedly how amazingly "faithful" this version was to Mr. Wells' original vision and (2)- having been SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED (to 'gag-reflex' levels) by Steven Spielberg's drippy-syrupy, happy-sappy, and completely illogical abomination of the same source material (replete with the otherwise lovely & talented Dakota Fanning's irritating "Screaming Mimi" performance).   So despite all of the "warnings" about the "bad acting," the "bad editing," the "bad cinematography," and the "bad special effects," I still played around with the idea that its faithfulness to the original story would more than make up for all of this film's many production faults -- or that I could at least overlook such faults, as I often am capable of doing when presented with an entriguing-enough story to involve myself in ("Sleepaway Camp," anyone?). But the more I read of your reviews, the more doubts I began to have, until it led me to do the ONE thing I had yet to do -- VIEW THE TRAILERS! Therefore allow me, please, to repeat EVERYTHING which has repeatedly been expressed throughout these reviews based solely on my observation of the three "theatrical" trailers I viewed of this movie:   * less-than-impressive cinematography  * stale/wooden (read: "awful") acting  * uninspiring & amateurish special effects  * incompetent editing   That this is the closest "by the book" film adaptation we have of the original story seems, to me, to be this film's only major (if not exclusive) selling point.   I have this uncanny ability to "look beyond" poorly produced/directed/acted films in favor of a "good story" (or, at least, a "decent" one), but I simply CANNOT bear to sit through such a high concentration  of these cinematic deficits all pressed neatly together into one complete package! If only a series of motion picture promotional "trailers" can cause me to utterly reject ANY AND EVERY interest in a film project I may have initially had & held onto quite so effectively, then I can only consider myself SPARED of even greater disappointment from something that was surely to be a much more horrendous experience 3-hours in length! From all that I have observed and read, I do not even believe (as many of you seem to do) that a "larger budget" would have made one bean of difference!   Thank you, my friends, from the very bottom of my heart! Thank you for your help in saving me from a fate not exactly "worse-than-death" but pretty damn close!    = = = = = = 
 I'm of a mixed mind about this book.  On the one hand, it struck me as sensational rather than scholarly, and written for a younger, more impressionable crowd (probably the same target audience that loves the oh-so-goff "Gothic Grimoire" and so forth).  The basic historical research about vampires is decent, though nothing you couldn't find in any other book about vampire lore. Again, my common gripe about occult nonfic is present (or not)--the lack of in-text citations. The bibliography actually had some surprising inclusions--Franz Bardon's "Initiation in Hermetics" being notable in that respect.  It's when the author gets into modern-day vampires that things get a little weird.  Now, in his defense, he does explain that he did get some rather....err...strange letters, usually by people who were obviously ganking their life-history from fictional sources, and so these weren't quoted. Even the letters that were quoted, though, for the most part struck me as a little ungrounded (is there any vampire who doesn't write with a melodramatic air?)  Now, he printed some of the letters, but gave little feedback on them. I think what he was tying for was a "You decide" kind of thing, but it came off more as "I'm not going to deny them because I ant you to think they're real". Just IMO, of course.  To his credit, he does go into the physical dangers of blood drinking. Most people these days are aware of blood diseases, but I got a little chuckle at the idea of someone ruining their cape after discovering that enough blood will make one vomit.  He's got an odd POV on psychic vampirism, in that all "intentional" psi-vamps are noncorporeal, and any corporeal psi-vamps are "unintentional" (ie, have no idea what they're doing.)  However, also keep in mind that when the book was first written in 1996, the internet wasn't nearly as prevalent, and so the main way to get ahold of those claiming to be vampires was through Fangoria magazine and related venues. There weren't scads of websites created by psychic and sanguine vampires telling it like it is.  Personally, there's a part of me that thinks that Konstantinos wrote everything he did (except for Summoning Spirits, which I very much enjoyed) with his tongue firmly planted in his cheek. I think he hit on a particular untapped target audience, found just the right books to toss at them, and is now laughing all the way to the bank. It's not that he's not serious about what he's doing, but there's an element of the Trickster here as well.  At any rate, "Vampires: The Occult Truth" is an average book with some flaws. There are better books on the topic that have come out since then, but it was what it needed to be when it came out. Maybe a revision will make it more up to date 
 after reading glowing reviews of the DBTs I picked up three of their cds. While some of the lyrics are strong, the songs have no melodies whatsoever. Most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer. They're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of Skynyrd and the Allmans. But those bands weren't just loud guitars...they had memorable tunes and great singers. DBTs are a huge letdown 
 This book sounded good:  An alphabetical listing of nearly all recent movie stars with a discussion of each star's worst film.  To qualify, a film had to be both a commercial and critical disaster.  Only problem is the authors appear to have written the book over a long weekend.  The entries are very short -- usually a page, sometimes less -- and contain almost no background on the films, apart from their box office take and, occasionally, quotes from reviewers.  We all know Halle Berry's a fine actress and Catwoman was a bomb.  Why not tell us how she came to make the film, what problems the film encountered in production that made it so bad, and so forth?  The authors did essentially no research that might have enabled them to discuss these issues.  Instead they provide a brief summary of the actor's career before and after the bomb under consideration and make a few smart remarks about the movie itself.  They would have to be far wittier than they are to pull this off.  In short, if you are movie fan, you probably already know everything you will read in this book.  For a much better book on the same subject, check out James Robert Parish's Fiasco 
 this books chapter titles were random as hell and so was the book. its so weird.  there is no plot whatsoever. i hated it, don't buy it cuz it sucks major balls 
 This movie deserves no stars, but the two stars are for the hilarious story, silly acting and especially the extremely bad direction. If you watch it as a joke you'll have a good time laughing. This is not a western but a comedy. The best laugh is towards the end when the injured sheriff (Dennis Weaver) asks an old couple for help then faints 
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 I had the same problem as the other reviewer.  This product seemed easy to use but just didn't work right.  It flew up in the air but did not go very high and didn't make very many bubbles.  It actually flew rather erratically and scared my daughter.  After a while, it just kind of pooped out and didn't work 
 Finally there is a solution to the problem of world poverty! Yunnus has proven, by the success of his bank's loans to the desperately poor, that the poor are masters of survival and the best equipped to pull themselves out of poverty given the right tools and support. Founder of the Grameen Bank, he and his collaborators in many coutries throughout the world (including the US and Canada) have shown that lending to the poor, helping them realize their own potential and giving them the support network they need to succeed is having dramatic results wherever it is tried. Yunnus' book is inspiring and an eye-opener. It made me realize that professionals working in large international charity organizations cannot bring about genuine change unless their offices and employees live and work among the people they are trying to help. It's hard to separate the book from the idea. One is as fascinating as the other. Out of 5 points, I give it a six 
 I almost fell for it...then I realized, how in the world are those pearls so cheap??  They aren't real!  If you are a sucker for a good deal like me think about it before you buy it.  It would be helpful if the item was advertised as "imitation pearl thong." 
 For decades feminist authors such as Miss Daly have used their dubious credentials in academia to promulgate the fantasy of a golden age before the onset of "patriarchy," It's the same 60s nonsense-strip away the fancy prose and you're left with the following executive summary: Women once ruled the earth with flowy robes and Gaia conjuring magic wands, and all the world worshipped the Goddess. Any woman who has the courage to study the historical,archeological and paleological evidence by academics with ACTUAL ACCREDITED Ph.D.s will soon understand that this gynocentric vision is a myth.  The effect of this genre of novel is not to increase grace, love and mercy, but to further splinter humanity into yet more little tribes, all petulantly vying for victim-status and privilege.  When we sublimate and externalize our spiritual pain and longing for God to a hatred of other groups (in this case, men) how can we find peace, happiness and  love in our journey through life?   Read books that open your heart. The best antidote to Miss Daly's agenda-of-rage is Cynthia Eller's  "The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory : Why An Invented Past Will Not Give Women a Future." Cynthia Eller easily exposes the Gaia/Sophia/Lilith movement as a scam, and helps the reader differentiate between the two major concepts of Truth: an external, objective and verifiable reality, vs. subjective concept groupings used to stabilize a fragmented secular consciousness. Another valuable read is "Interior Castle" or "The Way of Perfection" by St. Teresa of Avila. I challenge any woman to read those 2 books and conclude that the author was "marginalized" and repressed by the "patriarchy." More likely, they would understand that a loving apprehension of woman's beauty, power and regnancy existed centuries before the word "feminism" was ever breathed on a western campus. The great irony is that this vision of women, infinitely larger, more beautiful and complex than anything modern feminism has ever proposed, is the very reality which Miss Daly desperately wishes to extinguish in her disciples. In 50 years, the present farrago of theoreticians- Andrea Dworkin, Germaine Greer, Naomi Wolf, Susan Faludi ad infinitum will all be dead and forgotten, their books mouldering in bargain bins and used book stores. Don't follow their fate, sisters... only love is stronger than death, and you will find love in the men and women of the past centuries who knew God intimately 
 This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff 
 Intelligence in Warfare is a simplistic, arguably inaccurate, and often times pompous attempt by noted British historian John Keegan's personal theory that intelligence operations play little part in warfare as a whole.   Some have argued that this book is about how intelligence in but one piece of leadership, but Keegan's arguments refute this rather than support it. To Keegan, intelligence is sometimes crucial, sometimes not, and most of the time just a minor part of a whole. If that is the case, then why write this book? At numerous times in each case study, Keegan observes that the outcome would have been different had the intelligence gathered been acted upon, rather than cast aside. A chapter later he will complain that the intelligence should have been cast aside, and that basing decisions on faulty inteligence caused the defeat. He essentially contradicts himself chapter by chapter.   You can't have it both ways. Though his writing is fluid and poetic as always (Keegan makes the age of sail come alive better than anyone) this book is a prime case of "staying in your lane" of expertise. Intelligence is merely one part of the battle, and rarely tilts the decision one way or another. The challenge of intelligence is recognizing the value of specific bits of information in a sea of speculation. In this case, there are many other books out there on the topic that are worth the expense. 
 Country singers either sing about being drunk, drinking, having sex, or being patriotic. Well not that last one anymore, since 9-11 is a few years old. Hasnt anyone ever heard of quailty music anymore? Listen to Hank Williams or Marty Robbins. Thats real music. Hank sings about drinking but he actully wrote his songs, not like 90% of the country artist today. Plus, Hank can sing better then anyone in country today. 
 The book does nothing but make a lie of itself. There's no leftwinger that hates America contrary to what rightwing propagandists try to tell you. You can't keep complaining about Michael Moore and Dan Rather for being dishonest while at the same time trying to defend nazis such as Rush Limbaugh and Dan Flynn. Folks, you cannot complain about the left hating America when the undeniable reality is the rightwing engaging in unilateral economic disarmament and allowing China and other facist and communist nations to control America's economy and pretty much everything else of it 
 I am using this text right now in a circuit analysis course, and I believe the text is actually making the course harder than it needs to be.  I have a number of years experience in electronics and have taken circuit analysis in the past (far past).  This book, while doing a fair job on the basic explanation of the principals, uses trivial examples for illustration, then leaves you to figure out the more complex drill and homework problems with absolutely no help whatsoever.  In addition, the authors and Prentice apparently think that a student solutions manual would hinder the education experience, so their solution set is illustrated only in the instructor's manual, which is unavailable to students.  Consequently, you have no idea whether you have worked the problems correctly unless the instructor corrects them, or provides access to the solution manual somehow.  If I'm working problems at 2 am, running to the library or the department office is not an option.  The authors should redo this book completely and make it useful to students, rather than relying on the good graces of the teachers who use it.  In the meantime, be prepared to do a lot of outside research to help you with the examples.  Unless you have to have it for a class, send Prentice a message and buy a different book 
 Too bad, the lowest rating is a "one" star....because I would have given it "0" stars.  Very disappointed and a complete waste of money and time.  I broke the cardinal rule, I bought the book on a 'whim' and didn't even open the book before purchase...my ERROR don't let it be yours!  I skimmed the book in less then 30 minutes, less I actually think, because there is NOTHING of value in it!  Terry Allen wrote strictly of his personal experiences, which were very one sided and lacked ANY substance.  For example, he states, he sold 100 worth of options to his family for $1 each, then sold the stock years later for $100,000 each.  Question is how!?  Why would anyone buy stock from members of his family for $100,000 each?  What did the investors get in return, what was the basis for the sale?  No information is given.  There is just a bunch of incomplete thoughts and ideas in this book.  Sad and totally disappointed with myself for spending any money but mostly disappointed to think that apparently anybody can write a book with absolutely no value in it and still get it published.  Did the publisher even read the book?  Did anyone?  Doubt it because it is a complete waste of paper and ink 
 Boring. Boring. Boring. The story is boring. The writing is boring. The characterisation is boring. In a word, the book is a giant bore. I tried reading when it won the Booker. I gave up after three chapters. On seeing some of the comments here, I decided to give Last Orders a second chance. After all, I loved Waterland and if his other books don't come near to matching it, they are readable enough - although I couldn't for the life of me tell you what one of them was about.   Last Orders is told in the first person from the viewpoint of five people. This style of story telling only works if the writing is good enough to give the characters strong enough personalities to be recognisable from their own words. A voice of their own, so to speak. Swift is unable to do this. Without the names of the characters appearing on the chapter headings, it would be difficult to tell who was who. Consequently, I found myself caring little about them and nothing about their journey to Margate. In the hands of a better writer, this may work, but not with Graham Swift. 
 Well, I just had to try another Dr. Phil book, since it has been a number of years since I read Life Strategies. To be honest, even though he can be a polarizing figure, I have nothing against him. I think his TV is a source of help and inspiration for thousands of people.  This book however, was a real struggle to complete. It was not coherently structured, and the author kept saying things like "This book will show you...." all the way through the book. It felt like I never left the "Introduction" and he was continually trying to convince me (or himself) that this book really would eventually get to the point and that the point would be profound. Instead it really couldn't ever get moving and instead often relied on crass language as a weak attempt to get the reader's attention.  Fret not! There are other books out there that tackle the same general issue, but are far better reads. I recommend:  1. Failing Forward, by John C. Maxwell 2. Today Matters, by John C. Maxwell  Again, I have no issue with the author, and applaud his efforts. However, in writing a review to my fellow Amazon customers, I must strongly recommend that you spend your time on more impactful literature within this genre. Best of success to you in reaching your goals 
 I'm not an Austen reader but I picked this up because the author was from my home town.  It was a little predictable and perhaps I was lost on the connections to the Austen novels.  My book club gave it hoe-hum reviews as well, but none of us are Austen readers.  I do like the incorporation of the man into the bookclub and the snide remarks about his contributions to the potluck dinners.  So much like a book club to judge that 
 Some chapters (the basic Spring) are ok (even good.) Many advanced topics are covered in a sloppy manner. Further the editing is generally bad. I must say that I have read a finely edited book by Manning, namely Hibernate In Action 
 Nothing new for the 3-D afficienado here.  First timers will be amazed.  Doesn't have the artistic advances of a 3-D Book of Angels or Henry's Gift 
 This is a very poor vampire film.  I hate the plot story, it's just crap.  If you want to see good vampires movies try FRIGHT NIGHT - LOST BOYS - BLADE - FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.  They are the best so cheak them out 
 I don't know how this works because when I found that I would need to wear a chest band during exercise to make it work, I returned it. It isn't evident in the advert for this (or any other) heart-rate monitor. I guess I'll have to trust my sense of pain... 
 I bought this book because I went to a conference in which Burroughs gave a pretty decent speech.  I read two of his books (Magical Thinking and Sellevision) and the humor must have gone over my head.  I don't really care what grown ups do in their spare time, as long as it doesn't frighten the horses, but this one seems cliche-ridden and the jokes fall flat.  I know the literary marketplace has niches, but Sellevision's only redeeming virtue was that it was a quick read.  He missed some of his best opportunities at humor, and the "poetic justice" fizzled out when the exploititative director of programming John Smythe winds up happily divorced with his jailbait girlfriend at a cheap motel.  Max, the gay protagonist goes from flop (no pun) to failure to porn star (I wondered how long it would take for him to get there, since the plot development almost telegraphed it). Thin on plot, two-dimensional characters with cardboard brains.  How long did it take the author to dusctate this one? Mybe John Watters could do something with it, but he would have to bring it to life with a decent writer.     
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 This book from Ralph Nader, George Bush's best ally and secret weapon, shows why the great New York Times writer Thomas Friedman has accurately described Nader as a creature of the lunatic fringe of American politics.  Nader's connection to reality is extremely tenous.  He is a latter-day Luddite, and his proposals have no chance of ever being adopted.  This is why he has chosen the role of spoiler.  If he can't be President, he reasons, why should Al Gore?  Better to let a right-wing monster like George W. Bush become President and destroy the country 
 What teenager would want a teddy bear room? This book only has 4 basic ideas for a room and they all kind of suck. If you want this book , check and see if its at your library because its a waste of money 
 This book is painful to read.  The writing is clear, but it is so boring and repetitive that I can barely bring myself to pick it up.  It seems like a majority of the time she rambles on about issues that aren't even specific to technology, and are, as another reader suggested, common sense.  Unfortunately I have to read this book, since I am yet another CS major taking a required course in ethics related to technology.  The subject isn't bad, the book is 
 The book ostensibly centers on the David-Goliath story of an apparently valiant little band of religious dissidents who had the cheek to take on [...] and the Nazis. The story in itself is fascinating, but the author clearly has another aim, namely, to vilify the leadership of the Jehovah Witness faith. I have little sympathy for organised religion, having left the Reformed church some years ago. But this attack seems patently ill-placed.  Weaving in tantalising bits of history, the author alternately pouts and shouts, calling down evil on past and present church leaders, along with any academic that appears interested in, sympathetic to or admiring of Witnesses in Nazi Germany. Then he marshals a gaggle of like-minded critics who turn out to be malcontents and defectors with the predictable `atrocity' stories of the disillusioned.   Slogging through their shrill stories tired me. But what made me angry was the unabashed "blame game," in which the writer charges that the persecuted religionists brought trouble on themselves by standing up for their beliefs. Dismissing any contrary opinion with a label of "ridiculous" or "absurd," the author frequently sinks into the same behaviour that he charges his antagonists with-dogmatism, labeling, and manipulation of facts. Despite assertions to the contrary, the archival evidence he presents is woefully thin. That a reputable academic press would publish this book is quite astounding. I am seldom as critical as I am here, but this book and its vitriol left a terribly bad taste. 
 To tell you the truth, I couldn't make heads nor tails out of this book.  The language is too far away from even modern, and the characters are confusing.  I love sci-fi, even the new computer-oriented (some call it cyberpunk) stuff like "Snow Crash", but "Synners" is just strange.  Ala the Emperor's New Clothes..."Oh my, how strange!  It must be good!"  No, sorry, it's just strange.  I actually came here (to Amazon reviews) to see if anybody else had made sense of it.  I thought I might read farther if I understood it better.  I'm only to page 18, and I doubt I'll finish it. Dou 
 I just completed a group study on this book. We spent months on it, not setting any time limit so we could go through all the questions and down all the rabbit-trails we needed to.  I had a very hard time reading this book. It was not the subject matter, but rather the dryness and lifelessness of the book. I had to force myself to trudge through each paragraph, and became increasingly bothered and irritated, not really knowing why, and very puzzled by my reaction, which I describe as almost an aversion. Finally, at the final session, I was struck with the reason: THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THIS BOOK.  The Holy Spirit is the life of God in us. It is how God convicts and guides us. It is, in basic terms, God in us. Without a treatment of the work of the Holy Spirit, the book is not only incomplete, but uninspired and dead. 
 I lost my HP R607 while on vacation and needed to replace it quickly. I couldn't fine another R607 (which I really liked), so I purchased the HP M407. I thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...NOT!! I don't like anything about this camera...It's terrible!  You can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). It says "auto focus", but I don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! It takes a really looooooooong time to actually Take the picture after you press the button.  I really hate it!  Keep Looking...Don't buy this camera 
 In 3 Words, This book sucks. I can prove it in 2 steps. Pick up the book, and look it over. This book is so poorly writen 
 After reading all the other rave reviews, I thought I had found the dream machine!...but...alas my old Krups, though slightly on the down side of it's brewing and steaming life, does a much...I mean, MUCH better job of giving me a strong tasty latte every morning.  I may just order another Krups at a seventh of this price, and be glad I had it to return to.  Soooo, my recommendation is to not buy this machine if you like a really rich espresso, and a really foamy, hot latte.  
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 The FM tuner would not bring in a clear station without interference from nearby stations.  The radio part, hence, was worthless.  The speakers are sub standard, no depth.  Without the remote, little can be done.  All in all, it is not worth trying.  My cheap 20 year old Sony boombox is of much higher quality 
 Perhaps my expectations of this book were too high, but with all the experiences in her life that she had to portray, Joyce Maynard comes up woefully short in holding the reader's interest. Her early passion for J.D. Salinger becomes a seething hatred, with the acclaimed author seeming no more than a curmudgeonly near-pedophile. And, for all the exorcising of her demons and the details of her private life she attempts to share in this book, she is surprisingly light on revelations. I wanted so much more, but found that she used pages to go out of her way not to tell more. It's frustrating, and an ultimately boring read. I was very disappointed 
 I don't think I'm going to be around in 2025 to give an accurate evaluation .I'f I'm still here I hope I still remember who neil young is, and I'm still rocking in the free world  
 OK. I may not consistently turn out elegant prose myself, but there is a line. This book has crossed it. Opening the book at random:   page 64: "And me and Sheldon and May...." "...too bad for me. On account of May sailed way too speedy." page 65: "I couldn't even stay in my seat that good."  I understand that some authors phrase dialogue to convey dialect, et cetera. However, the audience for this book is kids who are still learning how to both speak and read the language. Learning awful grammar will not help them succeed. 
 I have read books on both sides of the issue and Mary did not handle herself well though she fought hard.  . It was noted by other greek philosophers that Egypt was a land of blacks. So, Why did she forget to mention that part of history. Gerald massey among others were white scholars who mentions the same things as Bernal, Vansertima, Dr. Ben. So, why did she not take on the other white scholar. Seems to me she was only speaking out of frustration and anger.  On another note there are some crazy people out there that says the black man created every thing which is not true. Contribution was made by all including the Africans. 
 I've tried this product many times using different methods and every time I end up with horrible streaks all over my applicances.  I'm not the only one.  Do a search on Google (...) and read a ways.  It seems hardly anyone is satisfied with this product.  Others recommend using Weiman's or Bar Keeper's Friend.  On the plus side, it does seem to clean the stainless steel surfaces well if you don't mind the streaking 
 Clearly I'm far too closed minded for this album.  If I wanted to listen to people screaming and crashing and banging completely out of sync I'd open my window at 5am while the neighbors are screaming at each other again and the early-bird construction crew is cutting concrete outside my apartment while the garbage truck is slamming the dumpster onto the pavement repeatedly.  Absolutely no musicality, no message, NO TALENT.    If I wanted to hear this I could go down to the local foundary yard and listen to them cutting steel.. FOR FREE.    I could go into a blow-by-blow for each track on why it's musical murder but that would be a grand waste of my time. Horrible.   This is one band that the indie snobs made it "uncool" to dislike, so everyone looks around like "wow this is flippin genious" while in their heads they can't believe that everyone else likes them and they don't.  GET OVER IT. You want arty music, go listen to Sigur Ros or Godspeed you Black Emperor.  
 My rating of 2 stars applies to the SACD version of this record and not the CD.  I consider the CD to be a 5 star recording.  After carefully listening to both the two channel SACD mix and the CD stereo versions I could not discern an audible difference.  I enjoyed the 5.1 mix and found the rear surround to be tasteful and subtle, not at all distracting, but, again, no significant improvement in detail except that created by spreading the sound around to five channels.  A recent article on the "Stereophile" website suggests that the SACD mix in fact shares the same 16 bit lineage as the CD, which would explain why the two channel mix and the CD mix sound identical.  Norah's label has cheated its customers with this one and should go back and do an actual DSD mix and replace these "CDs" for free or give us our money back.  There is no reason to purchase this SACD in addition to or in lieu of the CD unless you are interested in listening to a standard resolution 5.1 mix 
 I read this book on the advice of a friend who said it was an american literary masterpiece.  To my surprise I found the book boring and devoid of any value.  Miller spews out a self-absorbed diatribe intermingled with profane and tedious nonsense.    After a while I thought - why am I wasting precious time on this book?   There are other far better literary works.   
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 My book club read this novel. I'll admit it's well written; I couldn't have made it to the end if it had not been. However, it was impossible to relate to the crazy experiences the protagonists in this book had. I am a mature woman who found these two young men hopelessly dangerous. Almost every decision they made was senseless. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone over thirty 
 I bought this product to help cleaning the lense of my auto cd player. I tried it for at least 10 times, but no luck. Wet clean the lense manually is the best way, but that will include getting the player out from the dash board 
  I was told it is a very popular beginning reader chapter book series so I bought it and started to read it to my grandchildren I WAS APPALLED!!! OUTRAGED The grammar is atrocious- a true disservice to those learning the rudiments of language and reading. Will the author try misspellings and misformed letters next?  Joanie B. Jones is supposed to be in kindergarten, but the vocabulary/grammar cutsies are not even those of a two- two1/2 year-old.  They are just stupid. This is not an attempt at dialogue or street talk. The illustrations show JBJ as white, and big, and the errors are not street or dialect. For instance [from _Sneaky Peeky Spying_]: "I'm the bestest spier in the whole world" "I hidded in the dirty clothes hamper " "And Mother runned into the room." "Except for she beated me." "And we all runned to Room Niine Speedy quick." That's every two pages. I won't go on. Skip this series 
 I WANT TO KNOW WHY JUST A FEW DAYS AGO, TENDER YEARS WAS ON THIS ALBUM AND WHY IT'S NOT THERE NOW. WITHOUT TENDER YEARS, THIS ALBUM ISN'T WORTH .2/ BELIEVE ME, MY COMPANY WON'T EVEN SPONSOR THE DEEID AND THE CRUISERS ALBUMS  ANYMORE 
 Nice that all of these reviews are posted multiple times, word for word, for different books.  I WAS going to buy a few of them 
 After watching the movie "The Wedding Date", which is based upon this book, I felt like I'd missed something. It was a cute idea with amusing possibilities, but the movie was poorly executed. I figured I might as well give the book a shot. Usually books are better than movies, right?  Over all, I preferred the movie. Aside from a few moments of laugh-out-loud humor, most of it is pretty dry and bland. It drags on and on, with a good 100 pages to even get to the wedding. After the wedding, the book just kind of meanders, as if the author realized she couldn't possibly make it convincing that these two are so infatuated with each other after one afternoon. She could have meandered to 1000 pages, and I still wouldn't be convinced.  The book's biggest problem is the "heroine", Sophy. She is--as she often says herself--such a cow. Oh, and she's also fat. She's a raging b*tch towards Josh, who is technically doing her a rather nice favor, wouldn't you say? But she's constantly snippy with him, completely paranoid, and always assuming he thinks the worst about her. Plus, she lies on a consistent basis, especially to him. Yet he still likes her, despite all this...and despite the fact that she's fat. Any skinny, pretty woman is automatically a b*tch and a man-stealing cow. Maybe this is due to Sophy's fat-o-vision? Because of course, unlike those skinny pretty women, Sophy is too fat for a man to find her attractive. She's dead certain that as soon as someone a pound or two lighter walks onto the scene, Josh will be on them like white on rice. Isn't that lovely? But in spite of that, too, he still likes her. And despite the fact that she's fat.  Are you sick of me stating that Sophy is fat? Is it getting on your nerves? Because if it is, then this book will make you want to tear your hair out. I've been overweight for the greater half of my life, and I have self-esteem issues, but unlike Sophy, my every thought does not center around my weight. Of course, I, at least, would be justified. How the hell does Sophy, with her 36C chest, qualify as fat? Seeing as how she's about 5'10", a 36 inch underbust is not even close to fat.  Here's a little tip to the chick lit authors of the world: it's okay to make your herione overweight so long as you don't HARP ON ABOUT IT LIKE AN OBSESSIVE FREAK!   Completely unsympathetic as a character, it's impossible to feel bad for anything Sophy goes through, as she tends to reap what she sows. And the utterly predictible ending was completely unbelievable. Lovely idea, completely wasted on a Heroine From Hell and a "plot" held together by bubblegum and elastic bands. 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 This self-aggrandizing autobiographical screenplay has virtually nothing to do with Susan Orlean's fascinating book "The Orchid Thief", which is about legal inequality at the Federal level. Instead, Kaufman insults his employers character and our taste & intelligence by insisting that no one will see any film that doesn't have drugs, sleazy sex and high speed chases - none of which appear in Orlean's fine book, but are substituted by Kaufman for the entire premise of the original work.  Some of Kaufman's past work was novel and entertaining. This screenplay is, at best, depressing. Read Orlean's book instead 
 Beautiful piece. A dragon just seen in dreams (or nightmares). I recommend 
 Reading the previous reviews, several things are evident. The West Palm Beach review is nothing more than an ad hominen attack on a previous review.  Furthermore, the Palm Beach reviewer mistakes sticking to the subject with "we're the only game in town" argument/counterargument assertion.  It is very easy to ignore Hofstede's work completely, start from zero and perform a real cross cultural analysis, 2-3 three countries at a time, starting IN the native language and then making a comparison that speaks in its own voice.  This is NOT the same as Hofstede's doing the surveys in English and then translating them twice.  The Palm Beach reviewer also falls into the argumentum ad ignorantium fallacy (must be true because it hasn't been proven false) by saying "I mean that no reputable research on cultural values will fail to include Hofstede's work because it has been so influential" as well as appeal to celebrity.  While Dr. Littrell tends to lecture, he fails to address the problems of sample sizes in Hofstede's work.  As for Schwartz's work, folks who speak read and write Japanese, Korean or Chinese and who have lived in one of the respective countries for more than 3 years know that Schwartz's "prototypical structure of value systems" as well as his 1997 "Influences on Adaption.." paper don't come near East Asian thinking.  The odd fact is that the Palm Beach reviewer and Littrell both admit that Hofstede's work falls short.  The Palm Beach reviewer states," I don't mean that I think it is good" and "I have only read probably half of it" but then gives the book a five star rating. Littrell tangents on Hawkings but then covers for Hofstede by saying, "Theories are not facts".    Well statistics, when done right, reinforce theories enough to become a reliable base for future work but several reviewers clearly point out, with references, the shortcomings of Hofstede's statistical methods which again is odd considering the tone of these two reviewers.   Hofstede's work is useless and his defenders should work harder at dealing with the specific criticisms raised rather than pontificating or making condescending innuendo.  Sampling just students or just company employees should ring alarm bells for statistical skewness.  Furthermore, it is absolute cultural condescension to assume that a non native speaker of a given language can think like a native by using his own language and bring out a mere handful of qualities that are both universal and consistent across not just a few cultures but all at the same time.  The Eurocentric hubris running through this study undermines the credibility of the assumptions and conclusions.  The researcher must not speak for the culture.  The culture must speak for itself and this is the main point where Hofstede and his followers have failed completely.  For those with critical thinking skills, read the reviews that are negative and the journal responses between McSweeney and Hofstede and then construct your own model. For those who dare, remember, no one man or woman can complete this project by himself because no one in this world has such a Tower of Babel level of experience of the cultures expressed in their native languages.   Universalism is a big lie.  That's your starting point. 100% matching of traits across 200 nations will not happen when the study is properly conducted nor will the study's "voice" be censored by one corporate culture with statistically unreliable sample sizes.  Understand this and you are on your way to a true understanding of cross-cultural phenomenon 
 I enjoyed this book because of the way she blended history with a good story that keep you readin 
 I have been an extremely devoted SMB fan since the very first time I laid eyes on it. I own ALL of them, and so when I stood in line all night Saturday (and through Sunday morning, 8am), I made sure to grab myself a copy of SMB: Banana Blitz for my brand new Wii. I bought an entire set of controllers, anticipating the mini-game fun with all my friends. (We're huge SMB fans, all of us. It always makes an appearance at our parties.)  But now I'm really angry. They completely gutted our favorite mini-game(s), hitting Monkey Target worst of all. I can honestly say I don't care that there are 50 freakin mini-games, because now Monkey Target is completely worthless. Instead of the amazingly subtle game play with bonus items, increasingly difficult levels, magnets, velcro, double bonuses, wind speed and direction, and the all-import ramp run-off you have... a cannon, one level, no wind or wind direction, no bonuses, and no special items.  Who cares if I can SORT of pilot a submarine on a single level? Monkey squash -- no joy there. A lot of the controls for the mini-games are terrible. And so on, so forth. The new mini games suck almost unilaterally, but gosh darn, there are 50 of them! But volume does not make up for lack of quality.  I love traditional SMB levels and the ones on SMB: Banana Blitz are nice. The graphics are beautiful and fun. But the best part of the game for me and my friends, is now gone and dead. None of the reviews I'd read mentioned the fact that this favorite of most SMB players was killed like this, and if they had, I certainly wouldn't have wasted my $50 plus tax.  If Sega people are reading this: BRING BACK MONKEY TARGET. That's what people play at parties when they're slightly drunk and sick of listening to Super Smash Brothers, and way too awake to enjoy Mario Party 
 it's surprising that so many people gave this book a favorable rating - did we read the same book? i found "purple hibiscus" a little to simplistic and childish for any accolades - there was no particular insight on any of the issues e.g. physical abuse, first love, teenage angst/rebellion - to speak of, and the political ranting towards the end is laughable. apparently, everyone that can write a few words is now styling themselves as political activists, i wonder where ms. adichie was during those tumultous times - enjoying the breeze well away from the conflict in london - and now she's spewing out all the stuff she probably heard from her parents. i doubt that any self-respecting nigerian - unless you're the type that thinks "mills and boons" are literary masterpieces - will find anything remarkable about this book. as for people who don't know anything about nigeria, or africa, i suggest you read chinua achebe, buchi emecheta, or wole soyinka (for the cerebral) to get a real flavor 
 The author apparently makes a living out of writing one retirement book  after another and constantly revising those already written. This in itself  wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact most of the information  presented is less than thorough and comprehensive, and in many cases it is  downright misleading.  Buy it if you must but don't expect too get much  useful information from it 
 I picked up this book because I'm always looking for mysteries with an antiques theme. I have been an antiques dealer for many years and also have written a newspaper column on antiques and published newsletters on children's illustrators. I say this because I don't want anyone to think I'm naive in the practices of paper dealers. This doesn't mean I approve of them. The author doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with ripping a cover off and an illustration out of a $10 magazine and then charging $40 each for them, pitching the rest. She doesn't seem to think there's anything wrong with ripping apart a book, as long as it's "imperfect," so she can make a BIG profit on the illustrations. She isn't selling prints, artwork created to be framed and displayed. She's destroying publications that other collectors would love to own intact, even if imperfect. Old magazines and books are not a renewable resource for the collector or researcher, and fewer and fewer survive each year because of dealers like her. I know this criticism has nothing to do with her writing, but I will not read a book that promotes such practices and leads the reader to believe it's acceptable. 
 MORE LIKE A FINGERPAINTING!! A really bland one done by a child who has recently begun pueberty and become akward. Understand is a hell of a song though 
 The story is set in late 1943 but is unbelievable due to bad costumes and worse acting. A decent plot exploring the relationship between man and his enemy may be enough to keep the watcher awake, but maybe not. 
 My son received this as a Christmas gift. He and his brother and Dad were excited...got all set up to build it...and got nothing but frustration! These are really mechanically minded guys too. Very disappointing. I was especially surprised because of the Smithsonian name on it -- you'd think they would test this stuff before allowing their name on it. My guys never got as far as the reviewer who eventually got it assembled. The screws stripped and we didn't have the appropriate glue to even attempt a rescue. It simply would not assemble the way it was advertised. I am calling Amazon tomorrow about a refund. 
 There have been short stories that, with the application of some creative imagination and creativity have been successfully transformed  into feature-length films. The less successful attempts have resulted from films that simply `stretched' the short story with extended screen shots, lengthy silences and empty (not plot-advancing) dialogue. It is the second example that is most akin to this book.  This being the case, I will not dignify it with a lengthy review - but will, instead, come quickly and briefly to the point. This book is a deception - a title "The Genius Factory, etc ..." - like a false front on a Hollywood set building.  It might have been more accurately titled something like A Moderately Brief but Resoundingly Boring History of Attempts at Human Artificial Insemination: Both Successful and Unsuccessful. The notion of "Eugenics" and it's swollen popularity, for both humane and evil motives, in the early and mid 20th century is an interesting one and well worth study and reportage. Likewise, the efforts of "Dr." Robert Graham (an Optometrist) to create a sperm bank contributed to only by Nobel Laureates in order to improve what he saw as the degenerating quality of the human species is, again, fascinating and perhaps even important.  Sadly (and surprisingly) this book renders that issue in relatively brief form while dwelling for chapter after chapter on arguably related, but clearly less interesting, information about the history of human A.I. and the author's subjective experiences in looking into (and `experiencing' both it's products and some of it's required activities. What began as a few magazine-type articles in "Slate" have been expanded here to Feature Length - but not by the addition of interesting and relevant new data - but by an expanded spewing of word, historical references, and personal irrelevancies. I would estimate that no more than one-third of the text deal with the subject suggested by the title in a meaningful way. The rest is schlock filler. If I could reclaim the hours I spend listening to this book (yes, I listened to the recorded version) I would.  
 I couldn't decide whether to buy this book and so ordered through my local library.  Wise choice.  This is not really a full-length study but rather an expanded article/essay that falls apart after the first third.  Repetitive, reductive and sounds like an extended PhD dissertation.  A real disappointment.  Needed a good editor (like get rid of some of the unnecessary 'sics' and the repetition that borders on perseveration) 
 I received an email from txshirts stated that I should direct all inquiries to csr@txshirts.com. I did this on two occasions and received no reply. Customer service finally contacted me only to ask why I had left negative feedback on Amazon. They stated they never received any email from me.  Their gym shorts were not as described. The description said "covered elastic waistband". Instead, I received an "uncovered" elastic waistband that digs into my skin and leaves indentations on my skin.   Their response? I should pay for return shipping in order to get my money back.  But who should pay for return shipping when an item is falsely advertised?? 
 American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs 
 People cliam this fan is quiet, it's not quiet. I wanted a fan that will circulate the bedroom air during the night, it's too loud and keeps me awake 
 If we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the Prague Spring and street protests in the U.S., as Kurlansky attempts in this book, the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year.  The reader is owed specifics, yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes.  Prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent, but prohibited it.  Chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government, however flawed, resulting from open debate.  A bigger difference could hardly be imagined.  But Kurlansky does see striking differences, albeit only in the post-1968 world.  The Soviet bloc began it's decent to oblivion, while the capitalist West avoided the same.  His disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean, though what manner of "revolution" he envisions is never rendered to specifics, likely for good reason.  But who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do 
 First and foremost for anyone to examine this book as a Hitler-esk feed bag is as about as ridiculous as it gets.If not for the open sides of the Nixon mind we may be all speaking Chinese right now.What I got from this book is not only a replay of past pity, but also a new introduction into the narrowness of mind of all new generations. The man not only had the best interest in mind for the REAL American he also displayed a courage for those who followed. Shame on the media, the sapps they were,  and always will be, shame on the colony of past begotten ilk. The measurements of a President whose only fault lied in the trenches of an uncompromising war. Whether he turned left or right made not a difference. Can history blame Richard Nixon for being, perhaps, a "crook"? Sure they may. But I refuse and defy anyone who would subject him to be UNAMERICAN. A man who goes to bat for this country should be outlined in all his glory. This book fails to find the dimension of his mind. In that frame of mind, I myself must dismiss this fish-wrap as a grandstanding of left warriors. Or I can  otherwise move the masterpiece of  our 37th Presidents' psyche 
 After searching for months for a lesbian novel told in the third person, i was really excited to find Venus Envy.  I am currently on chapter 22 and I think i'll stop here.  I didn't like hte beginning, I haven't liked the progression into the middle and after reading these reviews, I think i'll jsut skip the end.  I read Brown's Ruby Fruit Jungle and i had really loved it.  Despite some far-fetched plot points, I was able to suspend my belief and give her the benefit of the doubt, but this one.. it just doesn't work.  I blame the dialogue.  It's really awful. But not that the rest of it is helping much.  It feels as if the author let the plot dictate the novel and not the characters and that just makes for bad writing.  I'd go for other Brown books, but just not this one 
 He was at his best when he sang about the loneliness, perseverance and dreams of ordinary people.  In "Sandra" for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour.  The combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique.  In the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions.  He released a few inspired tracks now and then, his first Christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth, and "Here at the Mayflower" was a sincere effort. He is an intelligent person who cares for music and doesn't let his superstardom go to his head.    So, what has changed?  And why this late in his career?  Barry has reinvented himself as a Las Vegas entertainer, Liberace style.  And he's released an album with unchallenging versions of evergreens.  I have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make people happy, like Liberace did.  And I have deep respect for that.  But I personally regret that Clive Davis and Manilow have now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience - one that doesn't really have any demands.     
 I purchased this book because I'm a big fan of near future science fiction stories and this book does not disappoint on the technology front.  It is certainly a realistic extrapolation of current technology twenty years into the future but the story is, well, downright boring.  The main plot character is Robert Gu, a recovering Alzheimer's patient thanks to 21st century medical technology.  Even after recovery though, you still have to be re-trained to fit into the modern world and so Robert has to attend the local High School with his granddaughter Miri.  The fact that the study topics at the school make almost no sense is a nice touch because current educational standards seem to be heading that way today.  Robert somehow gets involved at the periphery of a barely comprehensible conspiracy involving the great powers centred on the University of California at San Diego but the vast majority of the book is just about how he learns to interact with the real world using the wearable computer technology available then.  None of the characters are particularly interesting either.  The whole thing is very slow moving, never gripping and I could never get terribly interested in the story.  It was difficult to finish and quite disappointing overall.  Vernor Vinge can do much better than this and it's to be hoped that future books of his set in the near future are more interesting 
 I just reread it in a collection of Nobel Prize winning authors--their acceptance speeches etc., and this story and "As I Lay Dying" were chosen as examples of his work. This story!!! It's such a mundane little macabre "gotcha" story, over-anthologized for high school students (along with other tired stories like "The Most Dangerous Game"). Faulkner is such an incredible writer--I'm reading Fury in the Dust right now, and his sentences--the Nobel Prize committee described them as being "as powerful as Atlantic rollers". What was he thinking when he wrote "A Rose for Emily"? Obviously not much. Read anything else by him, you'll have a better time 
 We are using it as our textbook for our Master course in Australia. Both the teacher and students found that the practical examples are very  interesting. However, there are inconsistencies in the usage of exchange  rate presentations. Some mathematical calculations and charts are obviously  wrong. Mr Smithson, please spend more time to amend your book. Thanks 
 This merciless attack is filled with unsubstantiated pronouncements (not to mention typos) about Chaplin including a diagnosis of manic-depressive personality disorder offered nearly twenty years after his death and with no research nor expertise to support it. And is Joyce Milton herself qualified to make this judgment? Of course not. While this discourse is passed off as well-researched, one look at the notes and citations shows a limited selection of sources with a clear intention--to topple Chaplin whom Milton simply does not like. It seems as if the thesis of this book was in place well before the "research" began. Such is the tone of personal invective Milton fobs off as insight. I would never claim that Charlie Chaplin was a saint; no one can reasonably make that assertion about anyone. Unfortunately, Joyce Milton shows how imperfect a writer can be. Sadly for her, she picks up where Kitty Kelly leaves off. Shameful 
 I really really didnt like this product at all. I hated how it fit and the side ties are annoying, very hard to keep them tied. Also i'm petite so the dimensions of where thems were supposed to be were way off. The product would be much better if it came in auctual sizes as opposed to one size fits all 
 I really wanted to like this lantern. It is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price, but the light output is pathetic. The package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it, but I find that doubtful. The light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob Princeton Tec or Photon. In fact, I think you could read a map, or a book, play cards, or follow a trail, more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights. I'm returning mine. 
 this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website.  very old version and took forever to get here 
 This book has to be one of the most trivial books ever printed on the subject of the assassination of JFK. It is 107 pages long, with large print which is double spaced, and takes a casual reader less than three hours to finish. In the end, it proves absolutely nothing. In my opinion, this is one book that is truly not worth the time or the money. 
 Have read all three of this series, and will read no more.  Geoffrey Frost, the lead character, never quite reaches two dimensions, let alone three.  He is always perfect in his tactics, his plans, and his response to any situation.  The dialogue is wooden, and self-consciously done in the style of the period, to the point that it becomes a distraction.  In this book, the story is also highly implausible, and requires a suspension of belief that belies its intention as an authentic period piece.  And it's not just the primary character who is perfect: the "woods-cruizers" are all always in exactly the right place at exactly the right time, never miss a shot, always give sage counsel, and so on.  The few villains that show up are all quickly redeemed by their mere exposure to Geoffrey Frost.  I admit that I am holding this series to standards of Hornblower and Aubrey/Maturin, which are classics, and by that standard, Geoffrey Frost only rates a C+.  If you absolutely must read this series, do so at the library's expense, and not your own 
 Although I appreciate Dr. Sachs effort, his book lacked a new approach to ending poverty. It is a comprehensive, eye opening book for people without in depth knowledge of poverty and development, but for many scholars this book must have been a "yes we already know"-experience. The book is more a moral "we should"-appeal rather than a practical guide for people interested in ending poverty, because it does not offer new solutions. We have long known what we should do, on a micro level as well as in large scale programming, but how to actually make it work is a different thing. How do we get governments to meet the .7 GDP promise? How do we lower trade barriers, open markets, build infrastructure, gender equality etc. I will start "The White Man's Burden" today. I can use a good dose of grass root development realism 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 I purchased this for my mother.  She states that it runs too fast and it is painful.  I tried it myself, and it hurts just like she says.  Not recommended 
 What a "piece of work" this was.  Boring, slow, full of highly irrelevant side plots... just a bomb NOT "the bomb" ;).  It took me forever to finish it because I would literally start falling asleep after a few pages and this is something that I very rarely experience.  There are like 5 or 6 parallel stories in this book which none come to any level of satisfactory fruition at the end of the book.  Save your money and more importanly your TIME... skip to something else if you come across this one 
 The book's summary was actually better than the actual read. That's why I decided to try this author for the first time and more than likely this will be the last. I found the conversations between all of the characters boring and unrealistic. The relationship between Caroline and Max was super boring. Here you have an abused woman who could not stand up to her husband, all of a sudden calling the shots with another man who wasn't exactly a wimp.She demands that he be a person of character when she lies about her whole life.  And the scenes where Caroline and Max are very intimate in her apartment with her son in the next room and also in the office, turned my stomach. At the time of this review, I am still plowing through it. It is one of those novels that never seem to end. I keep turning the pages to see when the chapter ends. I'm not sure if I will finish it. I usually do not write reviews, but every so often I feel the need to release frustration and anguish. I can't wait to read something more appealing 
 i had never heard of anne tyler before i started seeing this book's  hardcover edition all over town. four years later i saw the book again at my local library and decided to pick it up (the demure nape had always intruiged me). what a mistake. i found it redundant, to the point where at certain spots, after i had set the book down, i was positive i had picked it up 10, 15, 40 pages earlier at a passage i'd already read. i soon realized, indeed, i was on the correct page, it was just that a nearly-identical scene was again playing itself out on the page.   how many times does the reader have to experience Rebecca's regret, nasty step (and full) daughters, her doddering senior citizen charge or squeemishness at the touch of her once-true-love? it was the same disappointing non-event over and over.   and i thought this book was also a shameful depiction of one woman's sorry, horrible life. it felt as though she was a mute doormat. i suppose it could be considered a "real" story but Rebecca's lot in life seems to be romanticised. it's not romantic or wistful or nostalgic, it's just sad. 
 Except for Stacy Keach, this show was a complete bomb I had bought the dvd at an auction....because when I was looking at the credits, Lindsay Bloom, who  played Velda, was listed....but to my surprise (yikes) this wasn't the Mike Hammer from 1984 Don't waste your money 
 For fans, I suppose this would be a rather big delight; for non-fans, it's nothing that will turn you on to the band from Jersey. They had some okay, cheesy hits in the '80s - but listening to some of their modern songs from this collection proves how completely out of touch they are nowadays 
 This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy.  I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned.  I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed.  After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines.  To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books.   
 For beginnings, insulting if your're not. Repeated material 
 Book contains many useful lists / charts / comparisons to define giftedness.  Many helpful hints about raising a gifted child.  Main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general -- and  may push those with "normal" kids into thinking they have gifted  ones and down that track -- when they should not. Gifted kids are the  exception, not the norm as this book makes it seem 
 This has been rewritten to dumb it down.  The beautiful language originally used by him has been replaced with dumber versions, and entire paragraphs have been removed.  As someone who read and loved the original story as a child, I was very disappointed to see this when I began reading it to my 7 year old son 
 There's weird but listenable (see: Bjork).  Then there is acquired taste (see: Stina Nordenstam).  And then there is quirky but endearing (see: Joanna Newsom).  And after all that we hit Coco Rosie who are weird, quirky and an acquired taste but, if we are being brutally honest, there is not enough of the listenable and endearing about their music to make you tolerate the oddities.  For some this will be a delight and they will rave about the album till the cows come home.  But most should be warned, this is eclectic in the extreme and simply does not have enough good tunes to make it a worthwhile listen.  A shame, really 
 The product is just piece of crap. don't waste money on i 
 Learned in its own way, this book is basically a romantic rumination rather than a scholarly examination of a topic -- conversation -- that today attracts more careful minds. Deriding in its early pages how-to-win-in-conversation books, Zeldin advocates a new form of conversation that involves greater levels of openness, creativity, etc., etc. While it is hard to disagree ("no more creativity!"), this hardly bespeaks any understanding of how conversation actually works, for which one is better referred to research in sociology, sociolinguistics, and related fields 
 I read Bonfire, Man In Full, Right Stuff, and Hooking Up, and then tried this one. I could not stand it! Amazing some of these reviews. If you read one of the above and want to try another, stick to that list. Electric Kook-Aide is difficult to read if you like a story that flows and becomes a page turner 
 If you read this expecting the humor and fast pace of a Stephanie Plum novel, you'll be disappointed.  It doesn't seem like JE did any more than wave a magic wand over these books 
 Although the setting and factors involved appear to be intriguing they just come off as "boring".  The characters are stale and PLEASE the endless details of the streets, roads, mountainside - NOT necessary.  I'm truly disappointed because up to this point I have had nothing but the highest praise for Daniel Silva's works.  But, like someone else pointed out in another review - something happens when an author writes about the same characters over and over.  I believe Mr. Silva has gotten just about all he can out of Gabriel Allon, et al - and I was disappointed when I discovered that although he had thought to put an end to the character Gabriel Allon in his latest book he was advised by some friends NOT to.  Too bad - I know I won't buy that one.  I LOVE to read and "consume" a book in a relatively short time period given my busy schedule.  Yet, I've been "trudging" through this one for weeks - not days 
 Save yourself some time and money and pass on this nonsense.    The author puts forth the idea that the Catholic Church will not ordain women as priests.  That is not the issue.  It is not a case of will or won't.  Halter tries to spin othewise, but fails miserably in this thinnly-vailed anti-Catholic tome.    There is no issue, only one simple fact: the Catholic Church cannot (repeat CANNOT) ordain women as priests because it is doctrine and dogma.  While church tradition can be changed, church docrine cannot.  A male priesthood is doctrine.  Here's an example, it is doctrine that Jesus is the Son of God.  The church cannot change that doctrine or it would cease to be the church.   Don't like the fact that the Catholic Church cannot ordain women?  Leave.  Join another church.  There's plenty of other churches out there that have women "priests."  At least Protestants had the fortright integrity to leave the Church.  Modernist liberal "Catholics" need to learn from their example 
 Frist of all this is  an okay album don't get me wrong, but I bought it because Johnny Ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really isn't. Plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom, with two tin cans on a string: one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it. Catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again I'd probably just d/l essential tracks like I Can't Be and I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced Ramones album like End Of The Century or Pleasant Dreams 
 Shallow veneer of "why" overlayed with "my company" and "my software"  Sad.  
 I got this item after reading a lot of peoples reviews on multiple sites.  For the most part they all said that it didn't work on one computer but did on another.  Well I own a Mac and know that Pooh wasn't compatible with that but I have access to multiple PC's at work.  Well I brought the item to work followed the instructions on installing the program disc and choosing my setting and then I go to plug Pooh in and it doesn't upload.  So I go to trouble shoot the item and go to Fisher-Prices web site and trouble shoot my bear and they tell me that there is nothing they can do but to send it back.  Well I am stubborn and I read some more reviews and decided that I should try other computers.  I went to four other computer and tried all of their available USB ports and still nothing.  5 computers and 12 USB ports later it looks like Pooh doesn't know my childes name and is getting sent back to Fisher-Price heaven.  Fisher-Price acknowledges this problem and yet they don't have a patch to fix it.  Oh well, just know that buying this product could potentially cause you to kill Pooh 
 This movie is the most boring, uninteresting piece of garbage I have ever wasted my money on. The plot is stupid, the characters are dull and insipid, and the whole movie leaves you asking, as the credits run, "So What?" Don't waste your money! 
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 I got to page 26 and gave up.  Lockes writings lack focus and are void of humour.  I read as much as I could with patience until it became clear this book was simply someone rambling on about nothing.  Save your money for something worth reading 
 Most Hercule Poirot mysteries start off at a brisk pace then take off on a dead run.  Blue Train starts promisingly, but it then begins to meander about as though Christie really wasn't certain where she wanted to go. For much of the first third of the book, one is treated to a sort of Victorian potboiler, with all manner of soap-opera characters coming and going.  When the murder finally occurs, it is a positive relief that something has actually happened.  Regrettably, it's the last thing that happens for quite a while.  Even the mystery itself is unengaging.  The perpetrator is reasonably obvious, and most of the story from the point of the murder onward is geared to try to deflect the reader.  But, stil, this is Hercule Poirot, who is as always engaging, urbane, witty, and wildly egotistical in turn. He can be charming or bullying when dealing with witnesses or the official police. The passages where he appears rescue this story from being totally boring.  Unfortunately, Poirot appears less here than in other stories.  If you want to have read all the Poirot stories, then you need this book.  If you're looking for a typically engagin Poirot story, give this one a miss 
 This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
 I purchased the product, used it for 2 days and it has not worked since.  The compnay has yet to respond to my request for return, and Amazon excepts no liabilty.  Needless to say I wasted money 
 This book may well have been filled with great writing, however, as a dog owner and lover, I was disgusted and depressed reading these stories.  The reviews on the book cover give little indication as to the repeated  ugliness within.  If you are a parent, imagine reading story after detached  story of babies being killed, lost and neglected.  For me, any great  writing was overshadowed by my sympathies for the dogs.  Not what I  expected and very sad 
 If you're looking for a book that likes to bash orthodox Christianity, rejects the historical person of Jesus Christ (the God-man), and advocates the view that God can be some impersonal entity then this book is for you. It is obvious that Hick has an agenda in this book: orthodox Christianity is not helping the cause for the creation of a Marxist-Leninist utopian world, thus, needs to be deconstructed to something that doesn't resemble Christianity at all. His main argument is that people of various religions experience the same "God" but do so differently because of their social, cultural, and geographical environment. Thus, YHWH is basically the same person (or entity, according to Hick) as let's say the Norse god Odin experienced differently. If this is not blasphemy, I don't know what is. He, thus, thinks that a Christian can work together in harmony with an Odinist, Hercules worshipper, Shintoist, Baalist, animist, etc. for the creation of a Marxist-Leninist paradise on earth. Hick is one guy who is angry at orthodox Christianity and wants to do something about it. It is obvious he is not working within the Christian paradigm but against it. In fact, he rarely quotes from Scripture to back up his points - which is no surprise, since Scripture does not support his outrageous claims. Jesus told his disciples in John 14:6 that he is "the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me" (NIV). Since Jesus said this, I can only believe that his words are true. If you are looking for good books on religious pluralism from an orthodox Christian perspective I suggest you get James R. Edwards' "Is Jesus the Only Savior?" and Ronald H. Nash's book with the exact same title. These books will surely demonstrate to you that soteriological pluralism is full of untruth 
 The first Nora Roberts novel I read was Northern Lights, and I was pleasantly surprised by the strong sense of locale, interesting and believable characters, and a well-crafted and exciting plot.  Angels Fall sounded like it would follow in the same genre, but it is more a gushy romance novel than a thriller.  This time the hick town location is cliched and dull, as are the characters (especially the heroine).  I started this book on a ten-hour plane trip, and put it down after a couple hours.  A month later I'm still only half way through it; in the last ten chapters not much has happened.  
 King of run-on sentences, that is.  The problem with Benford's books isn't the story.  This book, along with the first in the series, In the Ocean of Night, presents an absolutely fabulous story.  Benford has come up with a really excellent idea for a series of books.  The problem is Benford's writing.  For some reason, Benford forgets that "science fiction" consists of two words.  He places much emphasis on the first word, but doesn't realize that it's fiction.  Mr. Benford, this is not a science textbook!!!!!!!  Getting the science right in a fictional book is all well and good, but if one can use the book to teach a physics class, then the writer's priorities are a wee bit skewed.  If you wish to write a textbook, then write a textbook, and leave the fiction to fiction authors.  In addition to putting waaaaaaaaaaay too much emphasis on the science, the structure of his writing leaves much to be desired.  As previously mentioned, he seems to have an ongoing love affair with the run-on sentence.  There are literally whole paragraphs in the book which are nothing but one huge sentence.  And you can forget trying to follow a conversation via the use of properly placed quotation marks.  A quotation mark is to Benford what holy water and crosses are to vampires.  I give this book 2 stars simply because the writing is so horribly bad.  The idea behind the story rates a stellar 5 stars, but I had to subtract at least 3 for Benford's pitiful excuse for prose.  I actually feel that giving it 2 stars is a generous showing on my part, as I was sorely tempted to give it 1.  A word of advice to the prospective reader of this series:  Read it after having a couple of glasses of wine.  It helps.  (Seriously. 
 I loved this series and have been eagerly awaiting this installment.  I found it boring, dated - the characters who used to be so distinct, vibrant and hilarious were flat and one-dimensional.  Blah......... 
 The first time using the product it got jammed and I have not been able to open the machine up due to its malfunction.  I need to exchange it for a new pasta maker, however, I do not have any of information to do it.  It was thrown out by mistake.  Could you please send me information on how to exchange the machine for a new one and then I could be better at rating the product 
 Though I do not doubt Michener's writing capabilities, I find that as I continue to trudge through this so called historical novel, two stars is as much as I can give this book without doubting my own taste of literature.  Having recently read amazing works of historical fiction such as: THE BRUCE TRILOGY, by Nigel Tranter, and ALEXANDER, by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, CARIBBEAN simply does not compete.  While the writing can be quite descriptive, any attempts at making the plot remotely interesting fall short.  Just as soon as the reader begins to get interested in the storyline, the chapter ends and within the turn of a page you find yourself at least a hundred years into the future, with yet another dull plot.  In terms of historical accuracy, the book follows the timeline of events in a satisfactory way, yet the chapters, which are essentially short stories, tend to focus on the lives and troubles of fictional characters.  It seems that the book is more like a chore than an enjoyable novel, and attempts at romance and battle description are almost laughable.  Characters react to events in predictable ways.  Influencial thought is absent.  Accurate only half the time.  What am I reading?  This book is a waste of a tree! It is boring and history is followed in a jagged line.  Have I said enough? If you are currently reading this book I advise tou to spare yourself.  If you are looking for a top quality novel, historical or not,or a book with at least a limited amount of inspiration try one of the following, where exciting plot is evident, to say the least:  DON QUIXOTE, by Miguel de Cervantes,  TIDES OF WAR, by Steven Pressfield, THE WALLACE, by Nigel Tranter, THE BRUCE TRILOGY, by Nigel Tranter, ALEXANDER, by Valerio Massimo Manfredi, THE LORD OF THE RINGS, By J.R.R. Tolkien, THE CHARTERHOUSE OF PARMA, by Stendahl, and many more, which I have yet to read, which are most likely better than the one I have thankfully stopped wasting my time with 
 This DVD is fine for beginners who would like some stretching, but there is no weight loss aspect to it. I felt deceived by a cheap marketing ploy that appealed to my desire to lose weight 
 I read this book out of curiosity and it blows!  The advice in here is so simplistic that any moron would already know just about all of it through common sense (or from being locked up).  Don't waste your stolen loot on this book 
 The music on this CD is well recorded and makes very agreeable listening. There are, however, no outstanding melodies or themes. I would categorize what I heard as "sonic doodling." Quite frankly, I would not encourage anyone to purchase this album. Much superior choices would be John Barry's "Moviola" and "Moviola II.&quot 
 Do not buy this book unless you believe all dairy, meats, and nuts are evil and should be banned!  This man is an extreme vegan and for those who do not know what that is, it is a person that believes milk, eggs, nuts, fish, and meats will kill you. Feeding chicken to a child is the cause of obesity in America today!  Even breastmilk is demonized.  Now that I have that out of my system, the greastest disappointment with this book is the utter lack of theory and the studies to back it up.  On virtually every page of all his books (yes, I have suffered through them) are wild opinions with no references whatsoever.  For example, he states that in an uncontrolled study (or, in otherwords, unscientific) carbohydrates do not cause obesity but then just a few pages later states that carbohydrates may cause weight or fat gain.  Now which is it? I was the most shocked on his recommendation that diets with no fats and just vegetables and grains provide enough fat.  His idea of turning off the fat gene is not eating fat all together and if you eat enough vegetables and pasta you will no longer crave it.  Oh please, if dieting were that easy we would all be thin. His idea of controling food cravings is stuffing yourself with pasta or cold cereal but please no butter or milk.  He says that all nuts are bad because of the fat level but for those of you interested Cooking Light has reported a double-blind study of women eating nuts for a period of time and reported no weight gain.  Nuts are also full of vitamins and antioxidants. I find difficulty in his continual statements that if a person does not agree with him and his medical cohorts they are confused and do not understand the greater knowledge.  I wanted to find evidence that low-carbohydrate diets are bad and wanted legitimate data to back his assertions but the studies are just not there.  So the bottom line is if you want a vegan life, go for it!  You can look as gaunt and sickly as the author himself in just six weeks and be just as fanatical 
 This dictionary is not for the person who English is his second language. It does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word. In addtion, the micro doesn't work well with MS Word. 
 Cheers to any book celebrating the great black men and women of history, but Mr. Rogers either didn't do his homework or knowingly rewrote history. Claiming that Cleopatra, Hannibal, Ankhenaton and Hatshepsut were black is patently absurd. Cleopatra belonged to Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty of Macedonians, and the great Carthaginian Hannibal was Phoenician, a Semitic people from the eastern Mediterranean. Ankhenation and Hatshepsut were Egyptian Africans, not from sub-Saharan (black) African stock. Egypt's only black pharaohs comprised the 25th Dynasty (747-656 B.C.E.) when Nubians from Kush seized the throne. Shame on Mr. Rogers for this appalling piece of revisionist history 
 I found this at a used bookstore. Was happy not to have my money go to the author. His arguments, like all the conspiracy theorists, are based on innuendo or explainable "discrepancies" in the evidence, which is  presented in a very selective manner. HEL ignores the truly compelling  evidence that shows that three shots and three shots only were fired at  JFK's car. He counts up to 6 shots. Where are the bullets? The shells? The  shooters? Several witnesses saw a rifleman in the Book Depository window.  No one reported seeing any other shooters, even though potential witnesses  were everywhere. Plus - 88% of the 178 witnesses said they were certain  they heard three shots. HEL doesn't bother to mention thi 
 I did not find this book to have any "solutions." It was simply the usual self-help book which never goes to the root of any problem 
 Don't buy this book!  It says it lists native wildflowers, but lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) is listed in the table of contents.  This species has been listed as an invasive species or noxious weed in about thirty states.  Its sale is prohibited by law in several of those states.  Obviously the authors did not do their homework. I wouldn't be surprized if there were other invasives listed in there too 
 The episodes are great! And so it is disappointing as [censored] that WB don't put the episodes out in the right order - which have the consequence of messing up a story arc. It takes so little research to put the episodes in the right order, and it means so much to fans of the series, that it is UNFORGIVABLE ... hence my one star. (I just can't believe it can happen. I thought WB was a giant cooperation with concerns about their image, instead it seems that WB are as infantile as Bugs Bunny, whom I personally outgrew at the age of 3 seconds. If I give WB too less credit, then they must have done the mix-up of episodes on purpose - making it more rational for people in the near future to buy this product AGAIN in high def without the mix-up. So what are you WB? Babys or evil masterminds?)  I'm sorry to create a bad atmosphere, when people, looking at this title, probably just want to read some positive comments, to get excited, when looking forward to buying it (I do, when browsing products), but I believe it is even more dissapointing to discover the episode mix-up on the dvds unwarned, and I just had to get my dissapointment of WB out in the world 
 I'd like to give this period tv series higher marks; I love Michael Kitchen's wonderfully sympathetic portrayal of Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle, and Honeysuckle Weeks as Women's Auxiliary driver "Sam" Stewart is delightful.  Their interplay really makes the show.  It just isn't enough (for me) to compensate for many major shortcomings.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the show weaves contemporary (early WWII) social issues into its plots.  Not a bad idea - but handled in such a preachy way here as to be EXTREMELY off-putting.  Why is it wrong for non-essential civilian personnel to live outside the bombing area?  Apparently it's wrong when they rent rooms but ok when they sleep in their cars?!?  Worst of all is Foyle's out-of-character sermonizing, which sometimes takes weird turns, as in the episode where he tells a justice-evading murderer that he'll be on his case when the war's over.  Not only does this make no sense in view of Foyle's previous instructions, but I interpret the capitalist villain's bemused expression to mean "Thanks for the tip, copper, I'll be getting off THIS flight in extradition-free Ireland!!!"  D'oh!  Well, carry on, inspector!  The show's designers are also a bit careless with PHYSICAL period details.  Usually this is pretty minor stuff, but at least once produces a howler.  In the FIFTY_SHIPS episode, after a lengthy sermon on the CRUCIAL importance of not queering a deal to get the first shipment of U.S. military equipment ('even though it's just moldy American rubbish'), we spend the next five minutes of the show looking at a U.S.-made C-47 (cutting edge in 1940) in RAF colours!!!  As other reviewers have also pointed out, the stories are relentlessly pc.  I have no problem with the courage of closeted gays in the services; I'm sure that's true of all armies.  But after seeing the umpteenth evil businessman, prejudiced patriot, and cowardly bourgeois I switched to Sherlock!  The unforgivable sin, however, is the cheesy plotting.  It's not just that it's formulaic and predictable, but logic often gets twisted in pretzels to allow Foyle to 'detect.'  Do you mean to tell me that the police searched the garage but no one thought to look in that big tank until Foyle pulled a Columbo with the tea bag?  Is there a Gosford Park near this police station?  In conclusion, there're FAR superior Brit and, yes, U.S. detective shows out there.  If you like it pc try Morse; if you're into period try Poirot, Wimsey, or the Hickson Marple.  Leave Foyle unless you're desperate 
 This was one of the most influential books in modern history, but unfortunately for Western society, it was a pseudoscientific fraud. Mead claimed that women were dominant in the Tchambuli tribe, without causing problems. This statement was used as the intellectual cornerstone of the later Women's liberation movement. However, reliable modern references such as Encyclopedia Britannica make no mention of female dominance or power in those tribes, except for infrequent taboo ceremonies by female witches. (That tribe is also called Chambri or Chimbu in modern references.) Mead also described the Arapesh people as pacifist, cooperative, happy folks, and that was used by later Columbia University students such as Kerouac and Ginsberg as the philosphical basis of the Hippy Revolution. Modern references describe the Arapesh as having been just as competitive and warlike as other primitive peoples. (See also "The Samoa Reader" by Hiram Caton.) 
 Lacks the breadth and depth of an album worth repeated listening. I'd recommend spending dollars on a well known bald Bay area guitarist whose compositions astound and have emotional tension 
 While Avalon aka Windows Presentation Framework is still in beta, I had hoped that the code examples and references in this book would not be far out of date.  I am finding that they are dramatically out of date (writing this review 04/27/2006).  This is not to criticize the quality of the book or of the content; it appears to be well written.  However, it was written in September 2005, and there has been at least 3 new beta releases of the framework since then.  About 1/2 of the examples I have tried will not even compile, or have bad runtime errors.  The "big concepts" are mostly unchanged.  However, I cannot recommend this book to anyone.  Programmer to programmer, you will be better off reading examples from online sources like msdn.microsoft.com and downloading new WPF tools like "Expression".  This book will find you confused with broken examples fast.  I look forward to an updated version when Avalon solidifies 
 This book is bunk. Paul was not a feminist. Read Corinthians 
 This book contains a lot of information, and is rigorous, with many proofs and a vast array of problems. However, it is weak on worked examples and in explaining the concepts clearly. Diagrams are kept to a minimum. I used this book during an undergraduate Calculus course, and found that it did not help me to grasp the fundamentals of the subject. There are much better books available e.g. Stewart, which cover much of the same ground in a much simpler format. In my experience, only the ablest students were able to benefit from Apostol's dense writing style and scarcity of worked examples. Apostol does, however, include sections on matrix algebra and calculus which are not available in many other textbooks. There are also solutions to many of the problems at the end of the text 
 I thought with both Luke and Owen in the same movie it should be fairly entertaining. But I kept waiting for it to get good, kept waiting and kept waiting. Then the movie ended... aaargh, another wasted night. 
 A Royal Waste of Time is another character sketch on "how to do" Worship.  Although, highly insightful on Corporate Worship, Dawn misses the mark on true Biblical Worship.  She is blur of many authors today who are trying to "fix" Worship instead of doing Worship - just another slant on how to create a corporate worship environment 
 It was just that dry and boring I never really connected with any of the characters, I  gave up reading about 3/4ths of the way through 
 I've read a number of novels chronicaling the south asian female experience, and I didn't find this story to be original at all, save for the "5 women traveling on a train" bit. It seems like Nair took all those other stories out there, put a new bow on it and published it. Each of the women's stories follow the same tragic, sad path. I kept waiting for, hoping for, well, the hope. I also found Nair's language trite and disconnected. At one instance, the main character is incredibly self-aware, in the very next she's crippled by fear and insecurity. I'll offer that perhaps this could be a translation issue? Not sure if this was orginally published in another language...I found a number of typos too (I think the last line of the book was a major typo - how does that happen?!?)  Overall, I'd say that if you're new to this genre, you'll probably find this interesting. If you've already read others in this genre (e.g., Anita Desai's books, Clear Light of Day, etc.), I'd soooo skip this one. Lots more compelling and original stories out there (Brick Lane, White Teeth, The Namesake -- they don't take place in India, but all incredibly compelling stories about the Asian experience). Hope this helps 
 In the last few years rock music biographies have come of age and many are well researched, full of insight and show a real and objective understanding of the artist in question. Victor Bockris' study of one of the most important icons of the 1960's unfortunately falls far short of what I've come to expect.  The book reads like a lazy retread of thirty years of news clippings and has very little insight into what actually made the Stones become the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world. He's good at knitting together a constant series of quotes and old interviews into a below average narrative but seems to be unable to actually have any real understanding of the people behind the words.  With less than a quarter of the book dedicated to the years when the Stones actually had some validity and almost half of it dedicated to the incredibly tedious 'heroin' years Bockris misses the whole point of why a book about Keith Richards should be written. One unproductive junkie is just like any other and I don't need nearly two hundred repetitive pages to get the message. As another reviewer has rightly pointed out, the author seems to have an unnatural admiration of Keith's heroin addiction and completely fails to comment on the fact that it neatly coincides with the band's rapid creative decline.   I can only hope that the next four hundred page book on one of popular music's most influential guitar players will have three hundred of them covering the period of 1964 to 1971 with the remainder dealing with the following thirty six years when the Rolling Sones simply ceased to have any relevance 
 I happen to like sweet and funny romances including animals as pets, but this book was a huge disappointment.  For instance, the stories included one about a cat who was a person/witch in cat form, caused by a spell from an evil woman. It was ridiculous to me.  This book was more about fantasy/witchcraft than about cats.  I found it to be disturbing overall, as it was more scary/unpleasant than it was romantic.  In other ways it just seemed silly.  I am not opposed to stories about witchcraft,in general, but these stories seemed to be more about spells and evil-doers than about romance and kitties.  Not my "cup of tea."  I discarded this one 
 this show has copied off of other Gonzo shows and makes this the most unoriginal Gonzo show yet. The plotline is very similar to Hellsing and so are the characters. Rosette is like Alucard (though Alucard is 10x better) Integra=Sister Kate and Chrono=Victoria. Tise show also steals Full Metal Fumoffu?/Full Metal Panic's humor and comedy in the slapstick and perverted humor found in the show. other than the stealing from other Gonzo shows the music is horrible/ the CG [...] and the characters are unbelieveable. 
 In reading this book I had high hopes that it would be about empowering women or at the very least celebrating the sexual side of womanhood. I found it a rather juvenile  boring read and the course language in poor taste 
 I try to read items that I would not necessarily agree with. However, this piece of doggerel is nothing but exagerrations, misquotes, and spin. She uses tacky research to make points that don't exist, then brushes off any critique as "liberal bias". If you are a conservative, please read something that will allow us to discuss matters. Coulters' book should be titled "Slander: Liberal Lies I Made Up. 
 if i could give it no stars at all i would.  maybe its because its not what i expected, but nevertheless, its horrible.  the entire album sounds like something out of a porno, with the same bass lines looped over and over again.  every once in a while some cool percussion is heard, but it lasts for only a few seconds and is quickly drowned out by something predictable.  then again, i wasnt exposed to this beforehand and i in fact loathe this type of house music 
 all these so called remastered  from orignal copies ,they are not copies from orginal caused they they all have got different songs on all them .i went out and bought all the remastered cds got home started to play all of them and wondered gee some songs were missing ,got out all the orginals and sure enough they were all different ripped off  shane on you albert productions why have you lied to the ppl about orginal copies how would bon scott feel about that and brian johnson he 
 Do not waste your money in this movie.  The story is flawless, there is no chemistry between the main characters and their acting is terrible.  There are gaps in the story and the viewer just can not find any interest in any character main or secondary.  Minnie Driver's acting is decent but she can not save the movie by her own 
 I gave this book a reading not too long ago. Nothing about this book is "controversial". It's the same manipulation of information that neo-nazis and the kkk use to put shame to folks of other races. Books like these have always existed, and their purpose is to make money from readers who think the message is "ground-breaking" or revealing of some deep knowledge that has always been hidden from the public. If you plan on picking up this book, be sure to pick up a confederate flag and a few skrewdriver albums to go with it, this book is equally brainless 
 This CD is very disappointing.  My husband and I have become big fans of a wide range of "all ages" music and were optimistic about this CD, which was put together for a good cause. We just got through listening to it with our 2-year old and were surprised at how listless all the cuts were.  There is not one fun, bouncy, danceable tune in the bunch--with the exception perhaps of the Indigo Girls cut.  Our son loves to dance and really enjoys engaging music.  This compilation edges toward the depressive at times.  Even "Pure Imagination" hits a few too many minor notes for such a joyful song.  
 Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.  Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:  1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.  2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.  3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.   4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, "HCE."  This was Joyce's way of "getting at" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.  5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.   6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.  If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: "How many puns and themes can *I* find?"  This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.  
 The Sacred Romance is rambling and incoherent.  The author's nearly irrelevant personal reflections litter the chapters and do nothing but complicate extremely simple concepts.  If you read this book, you will spend 25% of your time reading and 75% struggling to make sense of what you read 
 I read this book in one day, and I was very dissapointed.  The book really is about 8 stories of individuals who made a million or more within 7 years. It does not offer any practical system or technique to make that million in 7 years except "make more money" (duh!) or "start your own business" or "invest in real estate! The stories are fine, but most of us have completely different situations and will not be able to apply what others have done...I always think any book is worth it if you get one good idea, so you probably can get one or two good ideas from this book, but that's about it. Do not expect anything beyond that because it does not deliver.. 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
   This book is basically microwaved left overs.  It is a presentation of the "Middle Way" of Buddhism.  One of the major points is that things only have the meaning that the observer gives to them.   Then it proceeds to bash any sort of conservative social or political views and carries a strong subtext of being a left wing rant.  This is quite hypocritical, and I am quite disappointed.  I would suggest if one is interested in the "Middle Way" that a personal investigation of Nagarjuna's original work would be much more useful.  Don't waste your time or money. 
 Who are these editors?  How long have they been business?  I'm a travel writer published in many publiscation and I never use this book for fact-finding for my articles.  I think the internet is more reliable and accurate.  With 1 travel book to my name, I have found everything for it on the internet.   
 Self indulgent, purile, child-like, pure unadulterated garbage of the highest order.  A truly horrible movie.  
  I used this book for the first and last time in Autumn term 2006 with 28 foreign students in my Global Finance MBA course.  When one wishes to make money by consistently reissuing new editions he has an obligation to update it at least minimally, (The Paul Samuelson Rule). In this case Greed is not good.  Hence, my exasperation when I open the 2006 edition of the book and on the first page learn that the currency of Belgium is the Belgian franc,  the currency of Ireland is the pound,(Ireland's curency was never the pound; it was the punt) or that Germany still has the DM. Many of students lost points on a midterm because they thought the currency of Finland is is the markka. Shapiro in 2006 says so. On the next page he fails to mention Monaco; there are a lot of capital flows internationally through Monoco. And on that page Spain still has a peseta.Portugal has escudos.  The book also suffers from wordiness. I did like the key phrases section in each chapter; I thought at least that all key phrases would be included in the glossary but I could find all there. There is a certain obtuseness which I did find perplexed my students sometimes, who did not quite enjoy this book as I had hoped. We would not use it again.  I tried to contact the author by email with several queries but did not experience the courtesy of a reply 
 I don't normally write these reviews, but I feel a responsibility to other readers to warn them away from this book.  If you don't want to know any details about the book, you have the option of not reading this review, but, if you want to know what you're letting yourself in for, read on.  If you are a horse lover, I srongly advise against reading The Horse Whisperer.  If you want a romantic love story, you should also look elsewhere.  If you want insight into dealing with a trauma, so sorry, no luck here.  The book opens with a graphic description of a violent accident involving a girl and her horse, which results in death.  Though I found these scenes truly disturbing, I hoped the trip taken by the girl and her mother to find an expert who could help to heal the girl and her horse would prove redeeming somehow.  Instead, the experience was muddled and pointless.  The few instances involving the "whisperer" attempting to heal the horse from its trauma struck me as something that would further traumatize the poor animal.  Nothing he does ever seems to break through and cause the horse any improvement.  Additionally, the mother appears to have no purpose in the story except wandering aimlessly around the farm, occasionally cheating on her husband with this man, and becoming pregnant with his child.  The book's focus then turns almost completely to this ill-advised affair which doesn't really have any chemistry to it.  The man and the mother don't seem that attracted to each other, and evidently only end up together because the plot required it of them.  During all this, the girl's psychological problems resulting from the accident are basically ignored.  She pretty much drops out of sight until the very close of the book when she is taken by the horse whisperer to witness another graphically brutal occurrence, which ends in another horrific death.  Apparently, what we are to glean from this book is that, if you are a woman who can't have children with your husband, getting knocked up by another man will save your marriage.  If you are a young girl who happens to witness a violent death, nothing will cure you except witnessing another violent death.  If you're a horse, you can just figure things out for yourself.  The fact that everyone seems blissfully happy after all this absurdity, just feels as though the author got bored with what he was writing and figured he had to wrap it up with a Hollywood ending somehow so he could get it off to the publisher quickly.  In the end, I see no reason to waste your time with this book.  I wish I could get back the hours of my life I spent on it.      
 This was my first Puzo book.  I was expecting an entertaining read.  Instead, I found the book to be a confusing chain of family dramas involving numerous un-engaging characters, plodding towards a conclusion that was less than exciting.  Paricularly annoying were the in-depth, opinionated (introspective?) analysis of the world of hollywood film making.   Maybe the choppiness and numerous twists and mini-dramas is just the nature of mafia stories.  Maybe I am just reading the wrong genre.  Because the only real thrill I got was upon completion of this book 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 All of the drinks have cute names like The Picasso, Bottoms Up, etc, which don't give a clue as to what is in the recipe.  If you want to use up your last mango, for instance, you have to either page laboriously thru each recipe or memorize the book. Neither the table of contents nor the index cover the ingredients 
 I love all the other Little Bear books in her series but this one was strange.  I'm sure that 30 years ago it wouldn't have seemed odd to tell your child a story about kisses being passed from one person to another but in today's age it just left a strange feeling with me esp at the part where the skunks kept kissing eachother back & forth.  At least they get married at the end of the story.  I took it back to the libray.  Glad I didn't buy it.  I own all the others she wrote however and love them 
 The cutter worked fine on the first 2 bottles I opened. After that it won't even cut through the foil of another bottle. I had a foil cutter from the rabbit opener that lasted for 2 yrs until the plastic broke in half. This one isn't worth it 
 I loved this player until the day I really, really needed to use it for recording, when I discovered that the MODE button no longer worked. This is the button you need to use to switch from mp3 player mode to voice record, line-in record, or FM radio.   The device is now permanently stuck on mp3 player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat, which is not the worst thing in the world, except that I specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. And 14 months after I bought it, too; conveniently post-warranty.  The screws holding the case together are impossible to remove, so there's no way to attempt a DIY solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable device-crippling problem. This thing is of no use to me now; a $200 paperweight. I'm never buying another iRiver product again 
 Who lives outside in barns, begging for food? Well, in a book called The Midwife's Apprentice, Alyce, aslo known as Dung or Brat does. Since she is starving, she asks people for jobs she can do. Aluce finally convines a midwife, called Jane, to give her a job. Alyce also tells Jane if she works, she wants food in return. Jane agrees to the deal, and that's when Alyce journey begins.   I didn't really like this book since it was boring. Even though the book was dull, I think Karen Cushman did a good job of expressing emotions of the characters, like when boys called Alyce names. I also feel a connection to the book. When Aluce didn't do an important assignment, she felt ashamed. I  feel ashamed when I don't do something important properly. Karen Cushman has also written other books like Catherine Called Birdy. Really, I wouldn't reccomend this book to to anybody since it was boring. But I think people could learn from the moral of the story: which is hard work pays of.   
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 I am an RN student and this is the worst textbook I have had.  The ideas in it are really scattered, so it is difficult to find anything in it.  The chapters are extensive, for no reason and with minimal content 
 I purchased this after browsing a book with the same title in a coffee shop -- but this is clearly not the same book. It's heavily padded with oversized illustrations that don't tell you much (old woodcuts, or 'artists conceptions') and sticks mainly to popular paranormal stuff (ghosts, UFOs and such) instead of more obscure, interesting, and weird topics. I'm going to keep looking for the book I really wanted, and I'll donate this one to my dentist's office where it'll fit right in among People magazine and Sports Illustrated 
 I, too, found this DVD a bit boring.  The instruction for each pose took forever, even in the challenging workouts.  While in-depth explanation is useful for beginner or even intermediate practices, I didn't feel it was necessary for the challenging sequence.  Also, I did not feel as if there was any flow to this DVD.  
 THis is a very cute CD player, but after I read the "toxic" waring on the electrical cord to wash your hands after handling and that it can cause reproductive harm--we returned ours.  I don't understand why they would make such a product for children to use?? 
 ridicolous creatureattaks a bar full of strange characters.it starts out pretty good whith the introductions of the characters but goes own hill fast when it bings nothing new just more gore.Krista allen however is always great to look at and she does not dissapoint in feast eighter,if only there was more of her to look at,that would have helped the movie a lot.ps does any one else think baltazar ghetty is a illigitamate son of martin sheen.Because he looks like two drops of water like charlie sheen in everything he does 
 I got the expensive one rather than the $14.99 Aroma cooker, thinking it will be better quality. Wrong.  I only used it twice, not only the rice get burn, after i clean in and out of the cooker, it still look dirty. The quality of the material was really bad. I think the Store where i got this products knows the problem that they take my return even it past 15 days requirement.  Do not waste your good earned money on this one.   
 The content of the book is good and my 2-year-old son enjoyed the book a lot. Unfortunately the paper is of low strength and is not up to the hard use that young users can dish out 
 As a former Novell MCNE I was expecting the same excellent coverage Novell provided in their CNE and MCNE certification books, but I was shockingly disappointed.  For example - look up the route command - configuring routes on page 372 - there are two short paragraphs of introduction on the first page and two screen shots on the second page, one of the output from typing route and one of the man page for route - I turned the page and... what a shock!... we're onto the next objective.  Nothing about relating entries in a route table to the route commands required to get them into the table. No explanation of what a route means, just the man page, which is the motivation for most people to buy a Linux book - but not this one.  The rest of the book offers scant coverage of topics that cry out for attention.  Of all the Linux books on the market, this is one of the last ones I would turn to for help. This book has served to deter me from buying other Novell books, although the course 307 and course 308 books for SLES9 appear to be much more what I was expecting - in depth coverage, and cheaper too if you get them used 
 I'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing.  I kept thinking, maybe it's me, maybe there's something wrong with my attention span that I lose interest in these stories half way thru.  They all seem too long, unfocussed. What they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories.  The quality puzzles me because I'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf I read in the zines.  I haven't followed this anthology over the years, but this particular edition, imho, shows bad selection and worse editing 
 Taylor's book is a quick read, and a decent way for a Beatle fan to pass the time.  It is packed with interesting (if not-very-detailed) anecdotes about the Fab Four that I have not read elsewhere.  However, it is poorly edited.  The author tends to group unrelated anecdotes together. Strangely, on page 52 he references Ringo as a member of the band, waiting with the others for Brian Epstein to get them a recording contract, but Pete Best is not sacked until page 59!  Speaking of Pete, he is barely mentioned in this book.  Once or twice, the author completely contradicts himself.  Interestingly, the first half of the book seems to be organized and written better than the latter half; perhaps the author was up against a deadline?  Still, this does not excuse the poor editing job.    I do not recommend this book for readers who do not already know the Beatles' basic story, as the author skips around quite a bit, and does not give adequate background information on some of the lesser-known "characters" in Beatle history.    I give this book two stars, as it *is* somewhat entertaining, and has several neat photos I have not seen elsewhere.  Alistair Taylor's story has the potential to be very interesting, but he needs a) an EDITOR and b) to expand upon his anecdotes with more detail.  Perhaps this book could be polished up and re-released? 
 I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; "Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular"   
 This book and others like it prey upon vulnerable LGBT people and mislead them into believing that love is sinful and should be changed.  Love is never a crime or a sin 
 This was awful from the very beginning to the very end.  Marvel proved that they not only make terrible feature films but they can't even make a decent cartoon movie.  It was dreadful from the very beginning to the very end: poorly drawn, no plot, no character development and mediocre villians.  Why did Bruce Banner look like a reject from Eon Flux, why was Thor drinking beer the whole time and why was he hanging out with a group of environmentalists when he is a norse God? If the villians were an advanced race of super-alliens, why were they defeated in 4 minutes?  Why were Iron Man and Giant Man made to be so unlikeable?  Don't buy it, don't rent it; if I were you I would forget that it was ever made.  That's what I am going to try to do.   
 Horrible book.  The racist continues his trend of substandard writing 
 I was excited about this DVD because of the customized workout feature, but I couldn't even make it through a preview. The instructor's voice is grating. She sounds similar to Denise Austin so if you, like me, are sensitive to voice tone: be warned. And then there's the unsettling psuedo-mansion parlor background complete with pillars and fireplace which, to my mind, is entirely wrong for a yoga routine.  If you're looking for a yoga DVD with a customized workout feature, I'd recommend the beautifully filmed and excellently instructed "Yoga Shakti" by Shiva Rea 
 In each pack there have been several dvd's that aren't any good.  Too many bad discs in my opinio 
 I loved "Killing Mr. Watson," the first book, and thought the genealogy in it was great, though I finally did find myself making a (complex) chart of who was related to who. But even with this knowledge  already in hand, "Lost Man's River" seemed to bog down. The  modern parts, especially, were very forced. Sally, among others, was just  not a believable character, and the sex scene made her even less  believable.   Moreover, when is all this set? The author hints that it was  50 years after Mr. Watson's death, which would necessarily make it 1960,  and so makes Lucius age 70 and Rob--admitttedly--an octogenarian. But the  tone and language, plus the attitudes towards drugs, race, sex, etc. are  much closer to 1975 (at least) than 1960. Several characters are depicted  as veterans of a war in Asia that "no one ever gave a damn  about." Sounds more like Vietnam to me than Guadalcanal or Okinawa.   Ironically (and it's a big irony) the most interesting thing about the book  is the critical name change for the family that was the "Richard  Hamilton" clan in the first book. In this book, the author calls them  the Hardens, but it's clearly the same family--even their initials are the  same. The names of all the other families are the same in both books. Why  the change for this one? It can only be because this is the family that all  the others believe to have some African-American ancestry. This was a big  issue in the South in 1910, and it is obviously nearly as big an issue now.  All the other surnames are of actual pioneer families of the Everglades:  Daniels, Jenkins, Brown, Storter, Smallwood, etc. The clear inference is  that today's Hamilton descendants objected to the author using their real  names and thus labelling them as "passing for white" (whatever  that means). It would be interesting to have Mr. Matthiessen confirm this,  because it brings one of the book's significant themes into real-time  focus 
 An unreadable exposition of the unknowable, or at least the ineffable. When Aquinas awoke to the realization that all his work was as straw, he probably didn't imagine that Milbank and company would be trying to send us back into that scholastic sleep one day. A little apophatic humility wouldn't go amiss here 
 Title: Strengthen the Mind Composer:Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Performer:Takato Nishizaki and Malcolm Bilso 
 This book was ridiculous.  I would highly suggest a more intellectual view of politics by a man with true talent instead -- Al Franken.  get his books, they are better and full of truth, unlike Druggie Limbaugh 
 "I don't want it" is the stupidest, most distasteful song ever. Don't tell people how to have sex goddamnit!!!!!!!! 
 Ok, I have LOVED Sophie since she hit the scene. But what the heck happen here? I'm stuck somewhere in the mid-beginning. I'm going to go back and finish it and will add to the review then, but right now I'm at a lost for words. Sophie come back! 
 This concept is good but the user interface and playability is terrible.  My 7-year old was frustrated with being forced to use the keyboard and no mouse.  And we couldn't figure out a way to go back to the main menu without exiting the game.  And playing a later level requires you to go through all the earlier levels.  And...did they actually test this thing on humans?  What a waste of potential.  It is a good concept 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one 
 There were several typo's or errors in the instructions which would have caused many problems for inexperienced knitters.  My classroom teacher had to alter the given pattern instructions in order for our flowers to turn out correctly.  I would not recommend this book 
 NO REAL ANALYSIS, UNSUBSTANSIATED, TOO MUCH HYPE AND SELF PRAISE. NOTHING MORE THAN AN AVERAGE TRADER KNOWS ALREADY BY EXPERIENCE. JUST A INTERESTING OBSERVATION, NO RIGOROUS PROOF, OF NO REAL PRACTICAL USE 
 Reading this book (until chapter six, where the book picks up somewhat), I thought to myself, "Why does my teacher hate me so? Does he find interest in learning about someone getting a bad headache from lack of coffee (which takes up an entire chapter)?" This book offers a different look at the Civil War. A boring one. Written 100 years after the Civil War ended (1968), this book set the precedent of "don't write about the Civil War if you aren't going to talk about battles, because it's boring." Read something interesting with your ever-disappearing life 
 There are not many movies I have switched off after the first 30 minutes, but this is one of them, and I recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise 
 I used to live in Appleton, the hometown of the Bircher's.  I picked this book up at a used bookstore, and later resold it about a year ago.  What really stood out for me was when Jasper TWICE--without any explanation--called Nelson Mandela a "murderous thug."  Take that for what it's worth.  read the book for all I care 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 Get the other guidebook 'The Bugaboos - One of the World's Great Alpine Rockclimbing Centres' by Chris Atkinson and Marc Piché.  It is vastly superior to the Green guide, being written by the ex-Kain hut custodian.  It has many more pictures, a thorough description of approaches, descents, equipment, weather, history, maps, etc.  If you buy in Canada it runs for about $40 CDN 
 Sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie, but Peter Sellers did many better films than this. "Dr. Strangelove" was the masterpiece.  "Being There" is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in Washington.  "The World of Henry Orient" (AT LAST on DVD!)is priceless but virtually unknown, with delicious performances from Sellers and especially his teenage tormentors.  Finally, the "Pink Panther" series is much better slapstick than "After the Fox," which has many famous, talented participants but is mostly silly, unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as Clouseau & Co. One irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations, as if we might not notice them otherwise. I agree with other reviewers that Victor Mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted, and Martin Balsam does okay with his stuff, too. When watching this film, I kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant -- I could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money 
 [...]  The story is about a down-on-his-luck writer named Martin who struggles not just with his craft, but also with a fruitless quest for love.  He signs up for a voice-mail dating service that, of course, turns out to be a dead end.  He also does some bar-hopping in a few odd and ostensibly quirky joints, with dismal results.  This book is bad, and not laughably bad, or moderately bad [...].  This book is insultingly bad.  I'd like to count the ways, but there are far too many, so I will try to summarize, and as kindly as possible.  The writing, to put it mildly, is weak.  Perez's style is hardly any style at all, unless you can call watered-down and clichéd a "style."  Even the very few moments of the story that threaten to become interesting are dealt with so clumsily and pretentiously that they devolve into the same witless and lackluster mess that surrounds them.  But that's no mean feat, since the story itself is so contrived that it, literally, sounds as if it were composed of the weakest moments of some prepubescent bedroom fantasy.  Martin's past, the women he meets, and his failures at work are all so bland and predictable that they make reading even this rather short book an excruciating chore.  Martin himself is a dull, inactive person.  It is nigh impossible to sympathize with this person's struggles since he is so amazingly unlikable.  He wanders through the story, wallowing in self-pity, exuding an ennui that is both colorless and uninspired, a textbook case of someone who treasures the miseries they've invented for themselves.  The book is peppered with samples of Martin's writing, and considering their quality (think lots of eye-rolling references to dreams, darkness, love, and loss) it's no wonder he's never been published.  There is so much more.  Consider the glossary of the Spanish terms that occasionally pop up in the book.  Perhaps it's just an attempt at silliness, but the gesture comes across as more self-righteous than funny.  [...]  Consider the weird, distracting, and (above all else) very dumb footnotes.  I will end by pointing at the novel's attached "Guide for Book Discussion."  I normally don't care for these.  They seem to say, "Not only is this book so insightful that you'll want to discuss it with others, but its complexity and brilliance also means you won't even know where to start or what questions to ask."  I'll grant that some books do fit that description, but The Losers' Club is far, far from it.  The questions themselves point out the vacancy of the novel's inner themes.  "How does Martin's life fail to meet his expectations?"  "Describe Martin's relationship with Nikki."  Or, perhaps most fitting, "In what ways could the central character be considered a 'loser'?"  I can think of many, and one of the biggest reasons is that his story is hardly worthy of the telling, especially when the telling is this bad 
 Indeed, these are way too short for protecting your knuckles. My boxing coach laughed when he saw them.   Ringside make really good, long wraps which are better.   --J 
 I'm sure this is a great tape for yoga enthusiasts, but it's way too hard for real beginners.  I do aerobic exercise for 30-60 minutes a day, so I'm not a complete couch potato.  I thought I could use some strengthening and stretching exercises, so I bought this program.  The trouble is that there's no working up to the positions  -- it's all or nothing, and if you're not strong or flexible enough to hold the position, down you go.  I found it really, really hard.  I could manage less than half the positions.  Since each flows into the next, you don't get to stop and try less advanced versions.   I hate to think what the advanced programs are like!   I also have a small quarrel with the outside of the package, which says that the participants are of "all body types."   That would be both slim and strong, and very slim and strong.  There are no pudgy real beginners on this tape.  For instance, if you're a woman who can't already do a number of full-body push-ups (no touching your knees to the floor!), you won't get through this tape. I think this would be a good program for people who've already done considerable yoga or strength training.  But it's not for beginners 
 I left behind my D-link DWL 132 (108 mbps) when I was on vocation which work great for me over a year. After read all the reviews, I decided to give this one (WUSB54GS a try).  The signal range was dispointed (D-Link DWL132 have much better range).  Setup with push button with Linksys Secure Easy Setup is easy with Linksys router, BUT I lost connection on my other Laptop PC which is not Linksys wireless adapter. I go back to re-setup my laptop than this adapter on desk top lost connection because of changing setting on the linksys router. One way or another, I spend 4 hours still unable to make both adapters work with Linksys 54g router. 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 This is a terrible book. I am a total novice in FrontPage and web page creation but have lots of experience in computers including programming years ago.   Usually I am the one everyone asks questions of with computers. I was unable find the Button she talked about on the 3rd page. I searched everywhere for it and asked Microsoft and HELP and still haven't found it.  She assumes you know where things are but we DON'T.  very frustrating experience 
 This is a piece of garbage. It's cute-looking, and *just barely* will fit *just* your DS and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth, but as far as any kind of long-term travel functionality, look elsewhere. The charger doesn't fit in there very well, which I don't think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case. I was able to squeeze both my DS Lite and the charger in there for awhile, but recently the zipper broke, and I had to split it apart to get to my stuff, and now it's useless. If all you want is something to carry just the DS in, this is a decent option. Otherwise, forget it 
    Just purchased 3 units , thought they would work as well as the Novi units they were replacing however they have absolutely no range . My original Novi 2 channel units worked well from a distance of approx 110 ft from house to barn , these only work in the same room... I am attempting to return these currently. 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 I know that design could be construed as using beautifully flowered language, but usually there's authors will combine that language with one main idea per paragraph which is (at least usually) part of a section or chapter. Alex passes up this convention in favor of metaphors and analogies which seemed more or less randomly selected. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get almost anything out of the first 30 pages of this book. Severely disappointed 
 I had high hopes for this movie. What a waste. Two men have a fling for 10 months. One guy is a hot shot in Argentina. He goes back home to marry a woman. His lover goes to Argentina to find him. The hot shot's mom arranges for him to meet the wife-to-be, but he doesn't know it (he thinks she is helping him to find Mr. Hot Shot). And the wife-to-be has a brother who was Mr. Hot Shot's lover for a couple of years.  And the lover and the ex-lover have sex...really committed to finding his pal, eh? The ex-lover and wife-to-be stage the ex-lovers death, trying to blame it on Mr. Hot Shot (in hopes of scaring the lover away). The lover and Mr. Hot Shot finally confront each other...and Mr. Hot Shot shows how shallow he really is. Mr. Hot Shot gets married. And the lover goes back home to the USA. The movie is shallow, the acting is less than mediocre, the story is really pointless (since Mr. Hot Shot never wanted his lover in the first place, and the lover wasn't serious about him...just an infatuation). The story and the acting seemed forced...neither one flowed well at all. Don't waste your time 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 I found this book very depressing. Anne Lamott's constant self-deprecation throughout the book caused me to really doubt myself as well. I know she is doing it to show that she's human just like the rest of us, but I think she can show that without hating on herself every chance she gets (saying the 9-year-old version of herself looked like a neurotic cat woman, etc.) despite what she says about how you shouldn't do that. It's like hanging around with a bunch of anorexic models, it gets to you.  This is not a good book for people who are not sure they are writers. I am not a writer but I am interested in writing and I would very much like to write fiction but I have a lot of trouble writing authentically. Lamott sends the message that "As long as you're a writer, as long as you're in our secret little club, everything will be okay!" 
 As this book is re-released, readers should be well aware that Michael Scheuer is the perfect example of the miserable state of American intelligence services - thankfully, he no longer provides analysis for the CIA, now it's the general public that gets to read his "intelligence". A great example of his extraordinary incompetence was provided on March 12, 2006 when he suggested to Ian Masters on KPFK, Los Angeles, that the attack on Samarra's Golden Mosque was more likely carried out by the Israeli military than by al-Qaida. From this text, as with his most recent pronouncements, it is indeed difficult not to conclude that Scheuer is absolutely besotted with bin Laden. 
 Battery is way overpriced. Contact Battery Store near you! I did and found this same exact battery type(2-6volt Batteries) for much less. While there they told me I could use a low amp 12v Deep Cycle battery instead. It did take some time wiring (FUSED LINK IS A MUST) but is well worth it. Lasts all day and you can charge it at a 2 amp "trickle charge" with a "amp selectable" car battery charger. All told it cost me less than $60 for everything. It now longer just "Takes Up Space" 
 This book begins with the absurd claim that 'the natural numbers -1, 2,3, 4 etc- appear to have been present at the birth of the universe; part and parcel of the original material from which was knit the ever-expanding continuum of space-time.' The author does not explain in whose mind these numbers are supposed to have appeared or how a concept can be present without a mind to concieve it. Like many mathematicians he seems unable to grasp that mathematics is a language. Thus it's not uncommon to hear ridiculous statements like 'the universe is governed by mathematics' As if numbers exert forces. But this is the first time I've encountered the claim that numbers existed prior to life!   
 I am truly disappointed in this book. I bought it because of all the positive reviews. However, after paging through, I see no conenction to the celebrities. The food was so-so and I was wondering if the authors really tested the recipes. I am most disappointed that there are so many bad reviews of this cookbook. 
 I sure am glad I did not waste my money on this book. The author had very few good things to say about any of the breeds. This book had so little information on my breed of choice, though it was seen on the cover, that it was a total waste of my time. It almost seemed as though the book was written to turn people off to getting any type of dog at all! Lots of negatives about the breeds, not alot of positives. Alot of generalizations 
 In viewing the product, I thought the warmer also came with the cup... as most coffee warmers do.  The cup was actually the selling point; so, I what I thought I ordered was different than the actual which was only warmer itself.  It's a shame, the cup displayed is beautiful.  Oh well, live and learn 
 12 case studies, into 12 paranoid people.  However, it doesn't take the most critical of thinkers to realize that Siegel may be embellishing the facts a little.  Don't take my word for it read the book, and you may find some of his stories to be a little far fetched.  Like the last story of the book (Paranoid Express) in which Siegel locks himself in a train cart, snorts cocaine, pisses in his pants, and suffers blistering heat, for three days, just to experience what Mario N. goes through in his final days before being arrested.  The unbelievable part, is that the police go along with Siegel's little experiment.  They bring him food, change audio tapes, and deliver messages in the same way they did with Mario N. for three days.  I don't think there is a federal government alive who would go to such great lengths to accommodate a professor who wanted to get coked up to prove that a murderer was paranoid at the time.  Don't get me wrong "Whispers" is an interesting read and a page turner, but they way Siegel ties his cases together like the game "six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon", is a little worrisome.   You have this little nagging feeling in the back of your brain that says "if he went to such great lengths to embellish how the 12 paranoids were connected or what he did to understand their pain", then maybe he embellished their cases as well.  If that doesn't bother you, then by all means get the book 
 I was halfway through this book and wanted to throw it against the wall,  it was that bad.  I have read her works before, and they were very good --  but not this one.  It was not scary at all.  The heroine was very  unlikeable--in fact everyone was.  I was definitely very disappointed in  this book 
 Some passages in "Hollywood Babylon II" strongly echo "Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries," an obscure pulp paperback by John Austin, written in 1969-1970.      "The girl's head was frightfully battered but that was the least of it" ("Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries," Page 82, Black Dahlia case).      "The victim's head had been bashed almost beyond recognition-but that wasn't the worst of it." (Hollywood Babylon II, Page 127-130, Black Dahlia case). 
 I have recently completed reading BabyWise II. I consider myself a Christian and this book is extremely popular in my church. Throughout the entire book, I had moments of complete confusion and disagreement accompanied by moments of complete agreement and lucidity regarding how to implement these methods. However, by the end, I realized that I should not be confused by or passionately against any section of a book that would truly benefit my child.   While I believe there are some helpful and necessary methods in the book, I had already found much of that advice in other sources. For example, feeding schedules are advocated by many resources, but those other sources are very clear when it comes to making sure babies' basic needs are met before implementing such routines. With my knowledge from other resources, I attempted to read BabyWise with a bit of grace, but at the same time I felt guilt and coercement at many points; for instance, when I realized that my child was having one more meal a day than what is 'recommended' by Mr. Ezzo for a child her age. For the record, my pediatrician generally recommends one more meal than she is receiving for a child her age.   This concern and my confusion on other subjects in the book prompted me to speak to my husband about the book and I asked him to read it. He read only the forward and immediately became suspicious. He asked me if there were any references and I instantly realized there were none. It then became clear that the pediatrician listed as an author indeed had no authorship save the foreword, and that Mr. Ezzo has had no formal education regarding child development. A very quick search on the internet confirmed our deductions, and we found many articles against Mr. Ezzo's methods, including a well documented student's masters thesis. Out of curiosity and still trying to find a way to defend this popular book, I performed internet searches on all of the other resources on child development we own (four books; all of which document research for their claims and advice) and found absolutely no negative press for any.   Based on how unclear I found the teachings in the book and how much bad advice I had to sort out, I strongly urge anybody who reads this book to read other books first. As I said, I don't disagree with all of the methods and advice, but it should be seen as advice from a person who has raised obedient (not a bad thing) children and has no other qualifications beyond that. You could do just as well asking advice from a friend or acquaintence with children who possess qualities you admire. As we all know every child is different and reacts to different discipline methods differently. Please make sure you go to many resources to find the option best suited to your child.   Just an end note: As popular as this book is among my friends, I have not known anybody to follow the BabyWise book beyond feeding schedules and sleeping issues,  and there is a good reason for that: Not all of it is good advice 
 Another enjoyable read, quicker than most because you don't have to think. It's not much of a mystery, and the Siamese cats really have little to do with its solution but provide a clever title. Mostly they give Braun a chance to ooh and ahh over the inexplicable ways of cats. It was many books ago that Koko actually provided a useful clue to his host, Mr. Q, the genial bachelor billionaire who is every tame girl's wish. Mostly this is a tale from Moose County, 400 miles north of anywhere. If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is certainly not right place for you to pick up this series.    Brrr is celebrating its 200th anniversary with Scots, a giant cake, bland good will from everyone, and Qwilleran's second historical disaster radio show up on stage. That's pretty exciting, too, when we get to hear the whole script. Oh, sure, there's a bad happening or two in town, but don't let that put you off for they occur well out of view. There's also good times with Q's good friends, and a subplot about an old lady, her fabulous antiques, and her mercenary granddaughter. There's no significant development in the relationships among any of Braun's stock characters--you know who I mean. To top off a pleasantly fluffy read, Braun appends two of Q's favorite delicious recipes. A quintessential summer beach read, guaranteed to pass a few hours pleasantly. 
 While I love the convenience of this dryer mounted to the wall, which is why I bought it, it lacks power.  It is also very, very noisy on the high setting.  There was no warranty either.  If it wasn't such a hassle, I'd try to return it.  It was the cheapest - you get what you pay for sometimes 
 Page 181 of this 309-page book starts with: "We have spent a lot of time looking at investment issues related to hedge funds: investment objectives, strategies, techniques, and so forth. The next few chapters take a brief look at some of the business and operational issues that arise in the hedge fund world." Finally! Well, page 205 hurries back to "The Menu of Hedge Fund Strategies" about longs and shorts, stocks and bonds and indexes and volatility. Why a publisher would cheat his readers with a title like "All about Hedge Funds" for what is just some investor's handbook is beyond me. Imagine considering serious participation in such fund and the term "Private Placement Memorandum" isn't even mentioned once in this book. Probably the author never heard of it: he intended to write about investing and did, but, discouraged by the crowded market in these books, shuffled in 23 pages about hedge funds so he could rename his book. I fell into the trap, make sure you don't 
 This novel employs weak and/or untenable character motivation to carry a ridiculous plot that presents itself as a "novel of ideas" but is in reality a pastiche of solipsistic ramblings and cullings from secondary sources.  As a novel of suspence, the narrative leaves loose ends and holes at nearly every turn, and the closure is so tepid I couldn't believe the diting could be so careless--one is led to think this "plot" is leading up to a climax, when instead what we get isn't even anticlimactic 
 This DK book has beautiful pictures and colors. The pages layout is nice too.  But many images are not suitable for little eyes. That's strange since this a book intended for children. This book is full of pictures of half naked people, various pagan idols, people wearing frightening masks, Lenin's dead body, Michellango's painting of a fully naked man, etc. I'm very disappointed and a bit angry 
 These movies are just total nonsensical rubbish about mutated babies.  From a horror movie fan's perspective, I remain completely unimpressed with the merits of these films and that includes the original, "It's Alive".  The only thing about babies (mutated or not) that scares me is having to change their diapers...it stinks and this entire trilogy stinks too!  What a worthless...waste 
 I never recieved this item...it was out of stock for 2 months with promises of delivery every other week.  I purchased something else locally.  If you have no intentions of restocking an item...you should say so from the beginning 
 Not only this book is poorly written but in fact its also written in a very confusing manner. Dr. Kreinin does not provide us with adequate examples for the topic he discusses and furthermore there is not glossary in the textbook, which is crucial for the students to get some quick facts without memorizing the entire terminology used in the book. I was surprised to find this book as part of the required readings for classes at Michigan State University and Northern Michigan University. I recommend that this bok may not be used as part of the curriculum for the students. It is not helpful and its over-priced relative to its limited use 
 This is probably the worst war related movie I've ever seen. I am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two. Time spent watching this film is time you'll never get back and have nothing to show for it 
 Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the  U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.  It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial.  Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and  doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green.  Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.  If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history. 
 I have listened to (and enjoyed) many books on CD in the past few years.  This reader is among the worst that I've had the displeasure of hearing.  The content of this book is great, so don't get me wrong.  However, the reader makes it impossible to experience the book the way it was intended.  He pronounces many character names incorrectly, including Carpathia and Adbullah.  His character voices range from unconvincing to downright abrasive and/or annoying (especially Carpathia's).  His voice inflection is often very wrong when reading dialogue.  He also adds pauses in the middle of sentences without any obvious reason.  These are just the most obvious and annoying problems.  There are too many to list completely here, so please trust me and avoid listening to this book 
 In all honesty, I found this book contrived and irritating in the extreme. It talks down to the readers, and the only time I have seen language as overtly flowery was when I picked up a Danielle Steel. The author has no identity of his own, and is instead trying to accomplish something that freely borrows from Marion Zimmer Bradley and J.R.R. Tolkein. If you're looking for something that reaches out to an audience above the age of thirteen, give this one a pass 
 Before you dismiss me as a stupid hater, hear me out. I personally think Omarion is a reasonably good singer & one helluva great dancer, but I swear to God that this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard.   This album is entirely deprived of emotional depth & there's not a shred of originality in sight or -more importantly- in sound. You've got love, sex & below-average club bangers, but nothing beyond that! If there's anything that annoys me more than the fact that I bothered taking the time to listen to this near-worthless junk, it's knowing that Omarion's fans & groupies were insane enough to blow their hard-earned cash & propel this album into the #1 spot on the Billboard Album Top 200! That says alot about musical standards nowadays.  However, there are some bright spots on the album that show hints of true potential in Omarion. "I Wish" is a beautiful slow jam about wishing he never fell in love with his certain girl, while Omarion's hit single, titled "O", will have any girl melting slowly as they listen to his smooth vocals, regardless of unoriginal subject matter. "Touch" is also another highlight, combining catchy, simplistic, danceable beats with smooth vocals & unoriginal subject matter (in this case, lust & sex). Then again, most club bangers don't need much substance, so it's no big deal in this case. I personally think this track deserved more success. Oh yeah, better not forget "Growing Pains", a touching song that explains Omarion's break-up with former hit R&B/Pop group B2K!  However, 3 great tracks & 1 above-avergae track (Touch) are not enough to save this album from falling apart. The rest of of this album is utter garbage (to put it lightly), and anyone with at least 1/2 a brain will realize how tragic this album really is. Omarion needs to put more thought & substance into his music before anybody truly begins to take him seriously! I hope Omarion improves if he decides to make a 2nd solo album, but until then, definitely skip this!!   NB: In case anybody's wondering why I bothered to review an album I consider to be so bad, it's because I feel that nobody, and I mean NOBODY, should be wasting their hard-earned cash on such ridicious, mentally corruptive Bubblegum cr*p like this. Not only that, but Omarion doesn't deserve the success his album got. There's obviously many more artists out there who are more deserving of success than Omarion in terms of a solo career 
 In my opinion, this is an un-needed book.  Why does a DM need a book full of "monsters" that are vastly powerful GOOD beings.  In the vast majority of campaigns, the players are good, fighting the forces of evil.  With the monsters in this book, the players won't have much to do except watch the battle.  This brings up a minor complaint about D&D that I've had since the game first came out...why do the developers always give a slight power edge to good?  Wouldn't it make more sense to give a slight power edge to evil, since that's what the players will be fighting against.  Take dragons for example.  The most powerful good dragon (gold) is a bit more powerful than the most powerful evil dragon (red).  All this leads to is the DM having to come up with some reasoning why evil dragons outnumber good dragons, like in Dragonlance Chronicles with the abduction of the dragon eggs.  Well, enough rambling off topic.  Unless you're DMing a high level evil group, give this one a pass 
 Although a cd teaching Catalan is great, it really needs to have the guide in order to use it properly. This is not clear in the description 
 Chief Picciotta took a horrific day in our city and country's history and tried to turn it into a personal account of his own so-called heroism. How dare he disparage the other people trapped in that stairwell who proved to be ultimately more courageous and more useful than he was. Many FDNY personnel can discount much of what he has stated as "truth" and it is really a shame that this fictitious book has become a bestseller. If you want to know the real story of what occurred that day in Stairwell B, ask the other 13 men and woman who were trapped with him that haven't felt the need to shout their heroic feats to the world 
 Having taken ballet classes for eight years, I was not at all impressed by this DVD.  The production quality is poor, there is very little barre work and the instruction is brief.  Much of the DVD is in fact movements which aren't related to ballet.  I attempted to follow this DVD one time and gave up - the instructor is awful.  Save your money and don't buy this 
 ...how dumb movies can get. Then again, maybe I was stupid to expect a spark of intelligence in this film. Just to give you fair warning, Matt (the main character) is the only mildly pleasant person in this entire film. Matt decides to get rid of sex for Lent because of a bad break-up. In his endeavor, he proves to be a rather bumbly but sweet guy who is sadly surrounded by horrid jerks who mess up his life. Most of the film involves Matt trying desperately to keep his vow of chastity and/or his horrid male friends trying to either get him to break it or checking up on him by running flashlights over his bed in an attempt to find semen; no joke! Not only are his friends hormone induced morons, but nosier than middle-school girls to boot! One of them even thought it would be funny to make his vow public, which led to a whole new series of taunting. Since this film is full of dumb-male stereotypes, I rather wish they had added the one that portrays guys as automatically violent when they're angry, because Matt's friends deserved to have their empty skulls bashed in (they irritated me a bit, can you tell?) However, as bad as most of the guys in this film are, the girls aren't any better. Apparently the filmmakers decided to fit bad stereotypes for both sexes in the story, because all the girls were soulless harpies who manipulated Matt and never got what they deserved. First, there's Nicole, the one who dumped Matt. When she hears of his vow, she decides she wants him back, refuses to take no for an answer, then rapes him (yes, rapes him) later in the film when he's handcuffed to a bed and asleep. Nice girl, isn't she? Matt's new love interest, Erica, is not much better. Throughout the film, she yells at him and throws tantrums like a five-year-old for no good reason. First, she gets mad because he didn't tell her the instant he met her about his vow for Lent. She pulled up all kinds of dishonesty bull and claimed that he had wronged her. Why, because he hadn't revealed his personal business to her the minute they met? They weren't even a couple yet! Rather than realizing that she's a guy's worst nightmare and running for the hills, he spends the whole film tripping over himself to please her. Her dumbest moment was later in the film when she didn't believe that his ex had taken advantage of him. You'd think the fact that he was handcuffed to a bed and struggling to get free would've tipped her off! Again, he's the one who apologizes; why not just put her on her broom and send her back where she came from? Normally I'm not this scathing in my reviews, but this film is the lowest of the low in intelligence and very high in crudeness. Not recommende 
 Don't spend your hard-earned money on this book. If you really want to learn about developing content for the Web, buy a good grammar book, a good style book and a good Web design book.  "Developing Online Content" is little more than a rehash of other publications, inflated with meaningless graphics and unnecessary new terms.  The only worthwhile parts of the book are the lists of resources 
 I love ethereal, ambient, healing New Age.  I have at least 250 CDs of this genre in my collection.  This will not be #251.  Do you remember the electronic piano/casio electric keyboard sound of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood?  It is in most of the songs on this album.  The few songs that don't have this are decent, but if you want truly healing, contemplative music, try Liquid Mind, Anugama, Raphael or others like them 
 I just can't find any possible way this could be seen as a good listening experience. It's so relentless in its coarse nature that, on sheer musical terms, it evades satisfaction completely.  Few things. One -- I haven't seen the film. Two -- James Horner is, without doubt, one of my favorite living composers; despite his flaws, I absolutely adore the man and his music. My review is probably somewhat inconsequential, then, because this type of score seems so esoteric anyway; I'm sure most folk who purchase it are likely fans of the film, to a good degree. Within that context, I imagine the score works far better at exuding emotion and ambiance. Without that particular visual, emotional context, the score is just awful -- dissonant, unmelodic, repetitive and grating.  At once, it is impressive that Horner has written such strenuous, dismal  music to underscore Gibson's film. It is uncompromisingly raw. Yet, this sentiment simply doesn't overcome the fact that the material found on the disc, as heard independently, is dire.  Possibly the least melodic Horner score I've heard. Orchestrations are good, and his unique choice of instruments inspired, but there is so little theme. It's the antithesis of fun; it's not beautiful, exciting, or dramatically moving, either -- three characteristics Horner often provides in spades.   Again, I do find it admirable that Horner has wrote such a [seemingly] authentic score that appears to lack emotional manipulation (which he often succumbs to writing for particular films), and his forceful approach marks a strong sense of selflessness. The album, though -- by God it's difficult, especially at an hour long. If you're about to criticize my listening capacity, know that I'm actually a huge fan of some more experimental, discordant film composers out there -- Elliot Goldenthal comes to mind. 'Apocalypto' simply doesn't immerse me, musically, one bit. 
 When in September 2001 Andrew Lloyd Webber's latest musical "The Beautiful Game" closed after only a year's run in the West End, people began to wonder has he completely lost his touch. The general opinion was that he needs to get back to the form he knows best: blockbuster productions interwoven with the lush and catchy tunes; a formula that proved magical for the most part of his long career and thus provided him with two of the longest musicals in the history of the theatre (i.e., "Cats" and "The Phantom of the Opera).  Hopes ran high when it was announced that his next project was going to be based on Wilkie Collins' famous novel "The Woman in White". This book was a smash hit after its first release in the 1860-is and its dark, gothic and mysterious story seemed a perfect challenge for a man who demonstrated he can successfully tackle similar subjects, as proven with the Phantom. The show opened in London in September 2004 and will have its American premiere in Chicago this year. Despite the fact the audiences are pouring into the London's Palace theatre to see it, this double CD recording of the show is an utter disappointment for ALW's faithful fans.  The CDs capture most of the show and this is actually the live recording from the opening night performance, with the audience's noises and applauses cut out. The problems of "The Woman in White" stem from several facts. First, there is the score. After listening to it; one can't help but feel you've heard most of these tunes before, in ALW's earlier shows. For the most part he seems to recycle the themes he used in "Aspects of love" in 1989. Thus, the numbers like "I hope you'll like it here", "Perspective", "Trying not to notice it" and "The document" are basically variations on the themes from "Aspects of love". Similarly, one part of "I hope you like it here" has "Gus the theatre cat" from "Cats" all over it. An ensemble song, called "Lammastide" came right out of the trunk of the tunes used in "The Beautiful Game"; it even features the pipes. Furthermore, another pattern from "Aspects of love" was used here: setting the dialogue to music. This, in turn, means that there are only few real songs here. All of the numbers I mentioned above could work much better by being spoken and there was no point at all in putting them to music. The real musical numbers are scarce and, what's even worse, trivial. One of them, "I believe my heart", sounds much better as a single released in the pop form, than as the part of the show. Again, on this recording it sounds too plain and dull; nowhere near the melodies ALW composed in the past. Pretty much can be said for the most of the songs here: they will make you yawn your way through both acts, except perhaps the nicely tuned "the Woman in White" leitmotiv and a Maria Friedman's moving rendition of "All for Laura" But for the most part, if it's not dialogue set to music, then we have tedious melodies with no appeal at all. Final judgment: The score is quite weak and repetitive.  On the other hand, the story, set in 1860-is, does have some potential. Some things have been changed, but the basic plot of the book is retained on the stage. We follow a young drawing teacher Walter Hartright, who is on his way to Cumberland to become an art tutor to two half-sisters, Marian Halcombe and Laura Farlie. Before he gets to his destination, Walter has a chilling encounter on a foggy train station with the mysterious young woman, all dressed in white. She is desperate to share her secret with someone. When he finally meets the two sisters, Walter is amazed how much one of them, Laura, resembles to the woman in white. After a while, Laura and Walter fall in love, but she is already promised to a young aristocrat, Sir Percival Glyde. Marian, herself keen on Walter, is determined that Laura should marry Glyde so the two of them could have a secure future. Before she sends Walter away, he has another encounter with the woman in white, who warns him Laura mustn't marry Glyde under any circumstances. Marriage does take place and Marian finds out too late that Glyde was only after Laura's money. With the help of the mysterious woman in white's secret, Marian and Walter now must work together to save Laura from the evil plan Glyde has formed. Besides the mystery of the secret in question, we are also intrigued by Glyde's charming Italian friend, count Fosco. Is he, with his unusual taste in white mice, vanilla bonbons and poison, a friend or a foe? Overall, the story has its merits, since when listening to the recording you really want to find out what is the big secret. Hence, the plot is the only thing that really occupies one's attention here.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the cast; they seem to match the triteness of the score. The trouble is that no one of the principal singers really sticks out. Maria Friedman, who likes to be thought of as a current big name in the West End, lacks a good vocal power. Her voice is at times too thin at the lover tones and when it tries to reach highs it becomes unpleasantly husky. The rest, Martin Crewes, Jill Paice and Oliver Darley, are nothing special. Only one name is of the top quality here and that is Michael Crawford, the man who rose to stardom by being the first and overall the best Phantom in "The Phantom of the Opera". His tenor hasn't lost any of the charms it had during the time he wore the Phantom's mask. However, his potential remains vastly unused here. First, the role of count Fosco is only a supporting one and second; the tunes Crawford sings are too banal. His big number, "You can get away with anything", especially its opening night version at the end of disc two, will make you laugh for sure, but the music itself is boring. Still, the way Crawford plays this interesting character is one of the rare highlights on this recording.  David Zippel's lyrics are not strong enough to cover up the leaks of the score. They sound predictable and for the most part do not develop the characters involved. The CD package comes with the full libretto and a couple of production photos.  So in the end, "The Woman in white" comes as a sort of a cold shower. As much as I am a big fan of his work, I believe "The Woman in White" should have turned out much better. Perhaps the revised version that recently opened on Broadway has some improvements, but this London cast recording remains flat in most of its aspects. One thing is certain: Andrew Lloyd Webber's artistic future is very questionable if he carries on at this rate. I can only hope that he will manage to find the muse of the musicals that inspired him for a long time during the past.  "You can get away with anything", sings Michael Crawford in his big number. Alas, I am not too sure that Andrew Lloyd Webber can get away with this one.

 Decent starting point for cooking-impaired college students if they don't mind eating eggs and potatoes often.  A little more variation in the recipes would be nice as well as some pointers on how to substitute ingredients and an explanation on why some ingredients do (What is the purpose of using cornstarch?  I know, some of it is common sense, but heyyyyyyy.... I'm a stupid college student). For example, for one recipe for frying chicken, I used pork and it tasted fine.     Also, some of the recipes don't really work.  Baking chicken drumsticks at 375 degrees in the oven for 40 minutes is not enough for thoroughly cooked chicken.     On the upside, the cooking tips were really helpful.  The book could use more of those, like be aware that if you heat oil, it pops and it could land on your face or burn your arm.  Overall, this book provides some ideas, but I wouldn't rely on it too much.  Not really worth the purchase.  Flip through it in the bookstore like I did and save some bucks for uhhh.... buying food. = 
 This DVD has new packaging but uses the same old non-anamorphic transfer and Dolby Digital Surround sound as the old version.  MGM needs to release an anamorphic version with 5.1 Dolby Digital!! 
 This book really wasn't at all what I was expecting, or what the title would lead one to believe. The subtitle, "In Search of Grace O'Malley and Other Legendary Women of the Sea," makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of Grace O'Malley, with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers. Not so. The first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself, and Sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information. I knew almost nothing about Grace O'Malley going into the book, and I know little more than that now. The other women included are discussed in even sparer detail, and most of them aren't even real historical figures, but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids. She even talks about Pippi Longstocking! Not what I was expecting at all...  "The Pirate Queen" is actually devoted far more to Sjoholm's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself. I learned more about Sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study. She describes the inns she stayed at, the weather, the tourists she met, her own childhood, the abundance of "personal bath mats" in northern European hotels... almost everything but Grace O'Malley and her cohorts. In fact, the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from Wilson to Sjoholm; a story which, to be quite honest, I really couldn't care less about. I bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures. It turned out to be a travel memoir, and a comparatively uninteresting one at that.  This is a shame, really. Sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - Grace O'Malley herself, Bessie Millie, Janet Forsyth, Christian Robertson, Eliza Fraser, Isobel Gunn, Betty Mouat, Freydis Eiriksdottir, Skipper Thuridur, Trouser-Beret, Alfhild, the "herring lassies," and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite, but then fails to deliver a full, satisfying portrait of any of them. She raises more questions than she answers, and I'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information. You may also notice, given the names, that nearly all the women mentioned are northern European in origin. Sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world, such as the famous pirates Anne Bonney and Mary Read who, though from Europe, sailed the Caribbean.  As for Sjoholm's writing style, the book is an easy read, but not a very enjoyable one. Sjoholm's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors. For example: "The lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates, walnuts, and chocolate chips. In the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola" (pg. 222). Flowery, gratuitous, and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin, you might say... It's not the worst book I've ever read, but I do wish I'd spent my money on something else. It doesn't deliver what it promises, and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead 
 If Zell Miller wants to live in a dictatorship, he's free to want that, but he's crazy with hatred for a party that has no power.  What a noble guy!  Rage against the oppressed - what a man!  This book is insane.  I read it at the local library and wondered how he considers himself a conservative democrat when he supports a man who spends like a drunken sailor on shore leave (though the drunken sailor isn't a fighter, but more of a mascott pretending to be a fighter....) and bloats the Federal government beyond and Democrat's wildest dreams....  why so many in the GOP have let hatred be the guiding force i'm not sure.  I actually believe in God and the God in the Bible isn't the champion of hatred and vitriol.  
 First off, let me just say that I LOVED the first three books. So when I learned that a fourth was to be released, I was thrilled. So when I got in and read it, I was really disappointed. A lot of the plot lines that Ann Brashares has been cultivating since book number 1 seemed to go out the window. It was almost as if she decided she didn't like them after all. Both Carmen and Lena had love interests at the end of the third book, yet neither is so much as mentioned. The third book made it seem like Lena had finally gotten over Kostos, and had moved on to Carmen's shy step-brother. Carmen meanwhile seemed quite happy with Win. Personally, I thought the character of Win was good for Carmen. In the fourth book, Carmen no longer even has Win, but she has turned into a shy, loner of sorts on the Williams college campus. My spring semester of college is just now ending, and I have to say that none of the girls' first years of college seemed accurate. No one could change as much as Carmen did in the first year. Bee finally has the man of her dreams, and it seems odd to me that she would forget Eric so fast and believe herself not to be in love with him anymore. Also, she never seemed to be the type to jet of to Turkey for a summer long dig. The dig also seemed unrealistic. From what I know of them, it takes a long time just to find one piece, yet they were finding whole skeletons and complete pieces of pottery. Not exactly realistic. Lena, the one character who I relate the most too, never would have posed nude for a fellow painter before. The character of Leo is almost to perfect, and not exactly believable. She also has reverted to dwelling on Kostos again. I thought she had gotten over him and had moved on to Paul. Kostos even makes an appearance in the book, in what is quite possibly the most bizarre scene I have ever read. I even had a bit of trouble understanding what was going on. The whole conclusion of her relationship with Leo was a bit sudden and unexpected as well. Now, on to Tibby. First of all, let me just say that I think it is way out of Brian's character to push sex with Tibby. I also think it is out of character for him to smuggle a bottle of wine into her dorm. While I do think he is the type of guy to visit her as often as he does, I still can't believe he rides a bus for 12 hours every weekend just to see her. It's understandable when Tibby freaks out over her pregnancy scare. However, I would have hoped she would have matured enough to not shut Brian out when he so obviously was trying to help her.  I could go on, but I won't. I will say that there were several nice scenes with Bridget, her father, and her brother Perry. Otherwise, I would recommend the just first three novels 
 Jerry Garcia was a stone cold genius.  The Grateful Dead was his backup band.  Bob Weir's solo work is easily as good as the solo work of Bill Wyman, Keith Moon, Dave Davies, and Clarence Clemmons. From a 40 year career this is the "best" they could come up with 
 My daughter received this as gift from her Aunt(an Eloise fan) for her 6th birthday.  I found it to be confusing.  I would not pick this for a child. Not my idea of a childrens book 
 Relentlessly bleak, this book makes motherhood sound like an endless nightmare. If you are already a mother, it will reassure you that your trials and tribulations are not unique. If you are not, it will probably scare you off ever becoming one. Over and over again, it describes how motherhood is painful, depressing, thankless, and a major cause of mental illness and poverty. If you managed to reach childbearing age thinking motherhood was pure bliss, this may be a needed reality check. But if you are uncertain about whether motherhood is for you, it will confirm, and magnify, your worst fears 
 I purchased this unit shortly before last Christmas. Initially the unit worked fine and the sound was acceptable. Within a month the unit would play the i-pod but there would be no sound coming out of the speakers. When I visited the Klipsch website to see about warranty information I saw numerous complaints about the same problem. Apparently there is an undisclosed defect with this model.(Just check to see how many refurbished units they have for sale on the web) I still have not heard back from Klipsch regarding fixing or replacing the unit.  Since I have little or no hope of hearing back from Klipsch, I have purchased the Bose unit and want to tell you that it blows the Klipsch unit away in the sound department. Bose knows what they are doing when it comes producing big sounds from small spaces.  Hope this helps 
 This novel can be summarized simply and briefly. If you like Jerry Springer, you'll love "The Unicorn".  It is not even close to reality 
 Mark Levin's book falls into some of the usual pitfalls that almost all biased political argumentation today falls into--evidence is often stretched and recontextualized to fit certain predisposed conclusions.  The book is clearly well researched, and Levin is no doubt quite knowledgeable about legal process and the language of the US Constitution, but his conclusions are often stretched to a degree that no longer fits the evidence.  I would hesitate comparing his method to a smokescreen, for I am not entirely sure if Levin is purposefully making exaggerated claims that he doesn't support but artfully disguises in the ethos of research, but at the core of many of his ideas are assumptions or basic contradictions that he just can't back up.  For example, Levin is trying to show with this book that there is a long-term conspiracy of liberalism that has been slowly forging opportunities for itself in the process of applying the Constitution to the cases before it so that there would be precedent to back what Levin calls unConstitutional decisions like in Roe vs. Wade.  Levin pushes a good case to look further (personally) into the basis of that and other decisions and if they do have Constitutional basis, but Levin instead goes into a history lesson of the decisions that predicated decisions like Roe vs. Wade with the assumption that every opportunity opened in previous decisions regarding things like the right to privacy was in fact the doing of a long-term liberal plan to open the doors of power for an activist court.  Certainly, legal cases are often made on the grounds of precedent, but instead of revealing the focus on precedent rather than the Constitution as a problem in the deliberations of the Supreme Court, Levin tries to turn the problem into an unsupportable conspiracy that comes across on the edge of paranoia rather than sound, unbiased reason.  And when Levin starts out the book stating that the justices should be treated as humans rather than gods, he wants to convey the idea that their actions may be questioned, but will not acknowledge himself that the history of precedents may also be the mistakes of the same human beings whom he does not want us to deify.  Levin also breaks his guise of the the reasonable viewer of history when he tries to establish the intents of the founding fathers, equating Jefferson's participation in prayer services at Congress as a direct negation of his over-used mention of the wall of separation.  Clearly, Levin cannot see no possible correlation between the two, and thus the questioning of the validity of prayer in schools must be a moot argument.  Just to make sure that his bias is clear, he throws in a little slippery scare tactic of suggesting a future where religious observance is also banned in the home.  Levin makes the same kind of rhetorical blunders when he suggests that Blackmun may have turned 'left' under the influence of his wife (while giving a little shot in the arm to Richard Nixon for having the foresight of wanting to base a Supreme Court nomination partly on the quality of a man's wife).  When discussing the famous argument over the inclusion of "under God" in the pledge of allegiance, Levin focuses more on how much the plaintiff's daughter actually wanted to say the phrase, which is of course moot when considering the actual legitimacy of requiring the phrase in a patriotic statement.  In the end, this book comes across as yet another argument of bias in what has clearly become a divisive popular culture--evidently, a book isn't commercially viable unless it has a line to hold, no matter which side. 
 I have enjoyed the series --  up to this point.  I had to force myself to finish reading Pillars of Creation.  If this had been the first book  in the series that I read it also would have been the last.  Not sure if I want to read any more after this 
 I have to admit, I can't stand books written in a question-and-answer format.  Its too hard to find what you need.  This book is a prime example of why I hate this format.  As an example, let's assume that you want information on "Getting People to Participate."  You go to the corresponding section and now have to wade through every question in the section to find something that may or may not be applicable to you and your session.  There's no doubt that there is some useful information to be found in this book; unfortunately, its just too darned hard to find it.  Save your money and buy a copy of "The Ultimate Training Workshop Handbook" instead 
 If you are a researcher in transport phenomena, this book will make sense, but you won't need it.  Unfortunately it is used for teaching graduate students.  There are so many steps skipped and so many examples depend on derivations in other examples (without referring to them) that this book is nearly worthless for teaching purposes.  The only good thing is that sometimes if you look in the bibliography you can find an example that makes sense 
 This is the stupidest book I have ever read- including Dr. Seuss! I think that Mary Pipher has some childhood issues that need to be worked out, because she stereotypes girls at a certian age as being something they usually aren't. I really can't say that it was worth the time I spent reading it 
 I am somewhat puzzled about how THIS book became a "classic". Mr. Darvas, "world famous dancer" with no training in stock trading starts out with a $3,000 investment in 1952 that would turn into a $2,250,000 fortune by July of 1959. All this was done via telegraphs from Saigon through Paris to New York to wherever else he was invited to perform. This process included some weird technicality called "stock-right bonus purchase option"; a desperate over-the-counter buying frenzy of a trade-suspended stock when short sellers made a bad call and some other exotic stories. Also, it should be noted that the author traded using various margins that significantly increased his leverage. (By the end he had more than $500k working capital along with a $3,500/week "regular" income.)   It is a hilarious, amusing story and you enjoy reading it till the very end, when you suddenly come to realize you must have had missed something. This book gives you very little factual knowledge about the Darvas system. In fact, the author had to attach an explanatory appendix to the end of the book, trying to clarify some quite fuzzy concepts (AND referring to his second book!). Reading the rest of the reviews here reveals that many reviewers read this second book from the author that attempted to further clarify the method.   But what is the method? Volume action? Price action? It is a "techno-fundamentalist approach", without any further explanation of what fundamentals are actually considered. (He refers a lot to reading this and that in Barron's...but what?) What is an "Expensive-but-cheap, high velocity stock"? And what is really "techno" about it? His "boxes"? You never figure out how he picked the successful stocks to begin with ("It began to emerge from the swamp of sinking stocks like a beacon...I was watching another stock whose action was fascinating to me...") Then, let's not forget that the author never fully explained his so called "feel" for some stocks and his "mental charting" technic. Well, try to emulate that one! A little additional clarification of this instead of the 10 pages of (worthless) telegraph copies and those 7 extra, empty pages could have gone a long way.   Overall, this book is an entertaining read. And yes, the author was a real person, 39 years old at the time of his interview in the May 25, 1959 issue of Time Magazine. As far as classic, that title I would reserve for a book like "Winning on Wall Street" from Martin Zweig.  
 I first purchased the Havoc Heli (the smaller cousin of the Reflex) and was very impressed even with it's limited control ability so I decided to purchase the Reflex.  I returned it the next day but am still very pleased with the Havoc.    Neither are "real" RC choppers as they don't use manipulation of the angle of the blades for directional control (not sure what the technical term for this is.) and therefore have limited maneuverability .  The Reflex uses the main blades to hover and 2 small fans on either side to provide the directional changes.  The main problem with the  Reflex is that it always drifts to one side (not related to adjusting the trim and the manual states that this drifting will occur) and if you happen to make a turn in the direction the unit is drifting in it sends the unit careening out of control and into the nearest obstacle.  The directional control stick is not analog and doesn't allow for degrees of motion but merely an on/off click in one of four directions at a time making it VERY difficult to control.    I would highly recommend the Havoc Heli (again, the smaller cousin of the Reflex) as it is a great value for it's low price (though it takes some getting used to) but for those looking for a more fulfilling (or outdoor) RC chopper experience you should go to your local hobby shop and invest in a real fully functional RC chopper (which can be purchased for around $200 with all accessories included at most shops) and skip the Reflex Heli.  It is NOT worth the significant price increase over the Havoc Heli.  
 I would class myself as an intermediate-level OpenGL programmer, concentrating mainly on Linux programming with nVidia hardware but also interested in Mac OS X. I bought this book because I was interested in learning about the more advanced OpenGL features: shaders, shadows and vertex buffer objects.  For my purposes, I have found this book to be shamefully poor. So bad that I am going to return it ASAP. The parts of the book which cover topics of interest to me appear to be factually incorrect and are accompanied by incorrect code. The descriptions are minimal and padded out with enormous amounts of code. The code compiles on all the machines I have tried in on but segfaults reliably at startup. Specifically, the bufferobject, occlusionquery, vertexblending and vertexshaders demos all segfault. The lowlevelshaders, highlevelshaders, bumpmapping, fragmentshaders, imageprocessing, lighting and proceduraltex demos also fail to work. I believe this is because they are not properly written and fail to make use of the available features, quitting when they discover that not all of the state-of-the-art features are available simultaneously. The only demos which do work are the trivial ones or the plagiarised ones.  Moreover, the parts of the book which cover basics are often either plagiarised verbatim or plain wrong (much better information and code can be found on the web, e.g. NeHe, and in the OpenGL Red Book). Many of the descriptions are needlessly convoluted. Many of the diagrams are huge and pointless. I suspect this is simply because the authors are way out of their depth.  I hope this review will help anyone else duped by the claim of Linux compatability. I would also caution readers interested in Mac OS X and Windows because the examples and code are likely to be misleading and are definitely not platform-independent. In the future, I would greatly appreciate more honest authors who stick to what they know 
 A very entertaining and well written history, but the passionate arguments against government taxation and regulation of smoking (hot political topics these days) are hard to take seriously.  Gately denies that second hand smoke poses any danger at all to non-smokers.  He is convinced that advertising restrictions, cigarette taxes, public smoking bans, and public service ads have no effect on how much people actually smoke.  (They merely infringe on the "rights of smokers.")  He ridicules the notion that cigarette smoke could be harmful to children.  His humor is usually enjoyable, but it is sometimes inappropriate (smoking-related deaths are actually a fairly serious matter), and it is sometimes hard to tell when he is joking.  For example, he cites UK government data that smokers die 16 years earlier than non-smokers and talks about all the money this saves the government in pensions, adding, "It follows that it would be financial madness for the British government to ban smoking, and unless a better argument than its official estimated death toll of 120,000 smokers per annum can be found, smoking is unlikely to be prohibited in the British Isles."  Is this funny?  Am I supposed to laugh or cry?  Gately frequently comes across as a loving mother who has discovered her son is a killer and has not quite come to terms with the fact.  She can't help wishing for him to succeed, even while acknowledging her sympathy is problematic and recognizing the irony of her situation.  Still, only a true tobacco believer could write in his concluding paragraph that "to the 1.2 billion smokers of the world, tobacco is not just a killer, but a pleasure, a comforter, and a friend...  Tobacco has recently been discovered to protect against some of the most devastating ailments of old age, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.  It has also been shown to guard against cancer of the womb....  Many great men and women have left elegant testimonies to their tobacco habits, which will be joined, I believe, with others made in centuries to come." 
 I've seen and heard Sheryl live when she's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs.  She's great - she's hip, self-assured and kicks butt!  But here, she tells the audience in "Leaving Las Vegas":  "I'm playing Central Park tonight... but I have some friends coming up so can you be patient...Please? For lil' ol' me? Be very patient...." almost begging the audience not to walk out while she's singing solo.  It's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the "friends" arrive.  The irony is that Sheryl solo is the best part of the album.   With the others on board, we can't see what Sheryl can do, and those familiar with her know that Sheryl is capable of a lot.   She's overwhelmed by Keith Richard, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Chrissie Hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature.  Her songs "It Don't Hurt" and "There Goes the Neighborhood" stand out on the album showing that Sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her "friends." Too bad she didn't include "Am I Getting Through" -- the Part 2 of that was a great rock moment.  Natalie Maines' grating voice (like fingernails on a chalkboard) completely ruin "Strong Enough."  Chrissie sounds like a zombie on "If It Makes You Happy", Sarah McLaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her Lilith-Fair mode that she adds nothing to "A Difficult Kind"...in fact, by the end of the song Sarah seems to disappear from the song as Sheryl belts it to the end.  That's Sheryl's song and should remain so,  Tombstone Blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of "All I Wanna Do" is the New York audience.  Happy, White Room and Gold Dust Woman are three classic rock standards, so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70's FM AOR radio has heard them ad nauseaum.  Problem here is that nothing new is added to them, they sound like karaoke versions.  Despite Sheryl's plea for patience, I was bored with the old-timers.They didn't bring Sheryl's career forward, only backwards 
 I have to step in and beg them to stop ...all of the authors that just republish the same material over and over.  This is another example of big billing and no filling. Great images, to be sure....but they can be seen anywhere here on the internet. And in many of the previous "Best Of.." books. This is NOT...I repeat NOT a "how did they do that"...it is geared to the saps like me that thought perhaps this time ...wrong again. Pass on this...unless you want another ... "don't forget the basics book" 
 Too long-winded. Too many seldom-encountered words employed. Too much evasiveness by the author, in withholding clear meaning from what he was saying rather than transmitting that meaning to the reader readily, willingly, succinctly and immediately.   A painful reading experience, not an enjoyable one, unfortunately. The author seemed to be trying to prove his cleverness, superiority and literary prowess (all of which he clearly possesses) rather than simply telling a story. It was a relief to get this book over with. The story was good, but the author took too long to tell it, with too many asides and meanderings.  This book is maybe a good lesson in why authors ought to try to be brief, clear, succinct. Authors will be taking up the reader's time without paying the reader for that time, and also are locking diligent readers into having to finish a story once they start reading it, and the author doesn't have an automatic right to more time than the story deserves. Did this story really need 470 pages of tight-set text?  
 This book is very thick and would seem to be helpful in planning a family reunion, however, it seemed to focus more on geneology research and finding lost family members.  It came with a CD-Rom, so I guess that was a perk 
 If you buy this CD just to hear some good music, or some good dnb or whateva, then your wrong. I read from some reviews that it was supposed to be dark. Well, I didn't need the flashlight I bought with me after all to  listen. Maybe the reviewers just heard it during some polar night, but for  me it's just another one of those "old-sounding" dnb albums. And  one more thing. If you think that light(/airy/mellodic) dnb is fast then  your mistaken again. 'Cause this album is despite it's lightness slow as a  snail. No fun 
 "What was he thinking?" was all I could think while watching this ... This is, without a doubt, John Travolta's worst movie since 1978's Moment by Moment with Lily Tomlin. The script is [weak] and the performances are lackluster. Lisa Kudrow, as in every role she plays, is downright annoying with her ever present snarling lip. Travolta is too talented an actor to waste his time on [stuff]like this. It's more suited to a ...comic like Rob Schneider or Adam Sandler. Director Nora Ephron also loses some credibility for having anything to do with this film. .. 
 i saw them play live.  some wag yelled "Gang of Three!" (there are three Moving Units members, and they are in no wise as remotely good as Gang of Four, whom they wish to ape) and everyone laughed.  this is some of the lamest music i have heard all year.  the singer's last band, Spectacle, xeroxed the sound and style of Stone Roses and early Creation jangle pop--THAT failed (the lyrics were thimble deep, the singing so bad it'd make William Shatner cringe), so now he imitates the new vogue-thing-to-imitate:  post punk dance pop like Andy Gill and John King wrote.  easily the most cynical record of the year--avoid!!! 
 It honestly pains me to write a plain review..  as it were, "damning by faint praise" I guess, however, I just felt very let down by Ms. Sutton's "Dancing in the Dark" album.  Though it is not terrible, nor hurtful to the ears, I couldn't help but feel very indifferent after listening to it a few times.  Ms. Sutton certainly has a musical gift, but nothing NEAR the level of Diana Krall or Stacey Kent, just to name a few.  Please excuse the layman's terms, but I will say this:  If you enjoy a very "voicy", drawn-out, sans instrumental style of jazz, then you perhaps would like this album.  If you prefer a jazz sound containing a more balanced mix of vocals and instruments (such as the afore mentioned Krall & Kent), then I would stay away from this album.  It really just boils down to a personal flavor I suppose.  Peace.  :- 
 This "book", if you can call it that, is a waste of money.  It would better be described as a pamphlet with a cover on it.  Instead, I would recommend Harry S. Dent Jr.'s book, "The Next Great Bubble Boom."  Both come to the same conclusion that 2009 is the beginning of a bad economic downturn, but the Dent book provides much more rational detail as to what to do about it 
 There is an album provided to follow along for those of us who are learning about classical music.  Unfortunately there are several errors only apparent when you play the CDs on a computer that tells you that what is playing does not match the album & CD label. I paid $17 for this album & am very unhappy with it 
 Philip Roth is a taste I haven't acquired yet.  He is lauded by critics - including Harold Bloom, who just happens to be a friend of his - as perhaps the greatest living American writer.  Before this novel, I had only read Portnoy's Complaint, which I couldn't even finish; I found it hopelessly dated, pedantic, and repetitive.  I like Operation Shylock more than Portnoy's Complaint, I guess - although I can't say that I really ENJOYED either.  However, at least things happen in this novel.  The gimmick of the book is that it is a "confession" - a story of supposedly true events that happened to Philip Roth in 1988.  The story concerns the emergence of a "fake" Philip Roth who is traveling around Israel, promoting the cause of "Diasporism" - the relocation of Israel's Jews back to Europe.  The real Roth travels to Jerusalem to confront his impostor.    Having now read the book, it is difficult to tell whether or not the real Roth is for Diasporism.  There is a lot of anti-Zionist rhetoric in the book - much of which I found distasteful - but is that the "real" Roth or not?  Is he really anti-Zionist?  It's hard to say, because he frequently asserts how foolish Diasporism is: the European community would not welcome the Jews back with open arms.     Somewhere in one of Raymond Chandler's novels, Philip Marlowe mocks Hemmingway as a man who thinks saying the same thing over and over makes it profound.  Well, the same thing can be said of Philip Roth.  There are a lot of things about his style I don't like.  He is very pedantic: he always has an axe to grind, but instead, he grinds his readers into the ground.  He allows his characters to speak, sometimes for pages at a time, without so much as starting a new paragraph.  His most annoying trait however, is how in love with himself he is.  It's odd but true - if you keep saying how great you are, people will believe you.  Through his characters, he lavishes praise onto himself and his books.  Also, he's apparently catnip to the ladies.  Is this novel non-fiction?  Of course not.  Will I ever read another Philip Roth novel?  Probably - with so many critics telling me I'm wrong, I have to allow for that possibility.  I'm just not looking forward to the experience. 
 I've visited the author's website and listened to an interview with her in which she raised a dichotomy: these days a lot of Americans "bash" the U.S., focusing on the "bad things" but few people emphasize the "good things." However, what the U.S.--and the world, for that matter--need are youth with the skills to critically analyze information and seek out the truth, not make simplistic judgements about "good" and "bad" based on blind adherence to self-serving ideals, principles or, in many cases, outright myths that pass for historical record. Her use of the word "bashing" to characterize any criticism of Americans seems to say a lot about where she is coming from. She gets one star, though, for urging parental involvement in education. But I will not be purchasing this book, based on what the author herself has said about it 
 Dr Laura gives some good advice but it is mixed with absolutely stupid advice such as when she says that a person should stay in an unhappy marriage because of their commitment.  It is unfortunate that she chose to use this relationship book as her soapbox to promote her own religous beliefs. If you dont believe in God and as Dr Laura, you can never be happy is the moral of her story. Laura makes a number of irresponsbile and misleading statements such as calling daycare, modern child abandonment. She talks about chastity until marriage several times and about 'shacking up' to use her term but never once does she explain why monogomy is important in a healthy relationship and she absolutely never mentions that a relationship has a natural progression part of which is physical. She moves the step of marriage up to be much sooner than it should be in a relationship while at the same time saying people should wait 'through the 4 seasons' or a year before being married. Actually says 'it is dangerous to pursue a physical relationship without the promise of marriage'. Is she saying men should promise marriage before they are ready?  She would have produced a much better book if she had given more examples of callers to her radio show or letters and given less malformed advice. Her rants and raves are actually entertaining, too bad that along with examples were cut short with her religious promotions and poorly thought advice snippets.  I listened to the whole thing(audio book cd) and I couldnt list the 10 stupid things implied in the title. I guess they are there and maybe under chapters 1-10 in the book. I could call out several stupid things but I didnt see 10 that stood out. Lots of it was common sense and phsychologically off callers made it obvious.  It is fun to listen to but make sure it is not the only book you use as a source. There are other better sources for relationship info. 
 Midnight Syndicate wants to be a lot, I guess. It wants to be dark and scary, but they're more like a graphic vampie novel, you can admire the technique but you don't really get involved. The images they produce remain a bit plastic, static, with an overdose of well-known themes.   Twenty one short tracks, too short really, are offered here, with a not-all-to-believable-and-scary voice talking: "Born of the night, they lurk in the shadows...Gargoyles of living stone, lost souls who wander mist shrouded cemetaries, and vampires who dwell deep within forbidden crypts... Creatures of the night, they arise as darkness descends..." Can lines about things that hide in the dark be even more cheesy?   Then some strings are touched like guiter wires and this sounds rather good. A heavy churchbell starts humming, dark but single layered ambient creeps in. But  it's all still too obvious, and more and more I get the feeling this is some sort of "starters kit for Gothic fans".   You want effective, deeply seeded dark ambient that really knocks the light out of you, try "Within the depths of silence & phormations" by Raison d'Etre or any of  Lustmord's solo albums "Heresy" or "The place where the black stars hang". But of course, giants in the dark ambient world like Lustmord or Raison d'Etre don't really mess with vampires and Gargoyles and bombastic electronic sounding choirpulp. And because of this, there will still be an audience for an act like Midnight Syndicate.  I just hope that M.S. will evolve more, make less tracks, and the ones they do make, should be stretched out more, giving them a chance to get more layered and filled with more depth than they are now.  Track three, the title track, offers a truely menacing piano tune, but because the composers don't seem to know what to do with it, they just keep on repeating it. And after a short three minutes the track is over. And "corny humming number four" starts. So what? 
 Don't order this battery unless you have money to throw away!  I ordered one that would not hold a charge, called the company and they told me it was defective and to send it back.  Did that and got a replacement that proved to be just as bad.  Now after 3 months, it isn't even holding a charge for more that 15 minutes of usage time!!!  This is unacceptable, and again the company is still trying to stand behind their bogus product!  AVOID AT ALL COST, EVEN IF THAT MEANS PAYING THE EXTRA $10 BUCKS FOR AN ORIGINAL KODAK BRANDED BATTERY 
 Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon "chloroform in print" and he wasn't kidding.  It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).  I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I don't know how anyone could believe this rubbish.  PLEASE, anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.  Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer, but it's worth a shot).    Joseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a "glass looker" - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish. He would use "magic stones" that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.  So convenient that he later found "gold plates" and used what he called the "Urim and Thum" (which, by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).    There are SO many myths that are told by members of the church "most men were SO distraught at the thought of polygamy", the age issue of Joseph translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's actual role in polygamy (which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband...  11 of Josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him, having NEVER divorced the first husband - what's up with that???).. etc.. and the list goes on and on...  I am not disputing that Mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts, I think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that's great! Just PLEASE do some homework first and don't just rely on the "power of prayer".  There is a reason that Utah is the [...] capital of the USA (I'm sure every one of those people "prayed" about that big business decision - it can OFTEN be mis-intrepreted).  
 The 78 minute long film "November" made a splash at both the Sundance Film Festival and the San Fransisco Film Festival of '05 as an official selection. Although it is a psychological mystery film, I think the real mystery here is 'what happened?!' This movie is both confusing and not too interesting to watch. The artsy element was no excuse to make a film that did not make any sense.  Sophie (Courteney Cox of "Friends") the photographer experiences a huge trauma (or does she?) when her boyfriend, Hugh (James Le Gros of "Point Break"), is murdered in a convenient store. She is left with headaches and visions of what could have happened as she goes through the stages of denial, despair, and acceptance.  It is very hard to follow, even if you pay attention throughout the whole film. It is almost like a puzzle that you must put together and interpret for yourself. Save your money, and do not buy this movie. If you still want to see it, even through the multitudes of reviews that are telling you how confusing it is, rent it and decipher it for yourself. Here is a little advice though: Don't get hung up on the fact that Hugh died. The second time November 07 is played out, he is still alive. It's a new scene. Forget the first scene (where Hugh is shot on November 07)  for a while, because it's not in sequence with the second 
 From looking at the D-Link website and talking to five tech support staff, it appears that there are countless versions of this card, each with different driver software. The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers. With tech support, I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download. However, they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver. The normal "automatic" approach did not work. And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2. So I called back again. And again. And again.  Despite being given a case file, each time I was asked the same questions, including what, exactly, is wrong. And each time I was told to do the same thing: Install from the CD. Reboot. Remove the program. Reboot. Install from the new driver. Reboot. Remove the program. Talk to a senior tech support person. Install from CD. Reboot. etc. It would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the CD. A clearly designed website would be second best. And tech support that knows what they're doing and speaks intelligble English would be a nice last resort.  I spent three hours calling D-Link technical support and speaking to five people, and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card! I am not alone in this experience; see cnet's web site user reviews of the DWL-G650.  Another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system. I believe he is right. It appears to have damaged my screen font for Windows message boxes. I have been unable to repair it. The DWL-G650 is bad news. I give them two stars cause they actually have tech support, though in this case it was utterly worthless.  Back it goes 
 I really wanted to read this book, and I did try (clearly, since I bought it), but couldn't get past the simplistic writing. The author writes in a passive voice throughout the entire book (for example, things like: "he was going" instead of "he went"; basically there's an unbearable amount of "was" on each page, and practically every sentence) and that's just really impossible for me to ignore. I landed on page 8 and couldn't force myself to continue. 
 Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts describes marriage as " a supernatural event founded upon a mutual exchange of holy pledges." The authors save this description for the last chapter, however, from the third chapter on the book is creepily christianic. They ultimately trivialize all advice that can be found in seminars, counseling, mentors, and books, presumably, even their own. All that a marriage really needs is religion.  I want my money back 
 We are a group of fourth graders from Mrs. Larson's class at Sunset Hill School in Lawrence, Kansas. Most of us thought parts of this book were boring. We thought the ending did not close out the story well. We felt there was something else going on in the story that the author didn't tell  us. The illustrations did not stand out and were difficult to understand.  If you looked at the illustrations they would not make you want to read the  book because they looked so sad. We also didn't like the story because the  characters had too much anger. We also thought the story should have a  happy ending. As it was it felt like the author had just stopped in the  middle of the story. Some people might enjoy this book but we didn't 
 I was quite disappointed with this book. None of the techniques covered are in any way different from the basics of using filters in Photoshop or cloning in Painter that would be covered in a basic manual. If you want inspiration and instruction in the creative use of these two programs, "Digital Collage and Painting Using Photoshop and Painter to Create Fine Art" by Susan Ruddick Bloom is a much better choice in every way 
 Only intensive psychotherapy, delving deep into a patient's childhood, can find the reason why, in times of stess, the patient becomes invisible. That would be a plausible hypothesis if the patient's claim that he becomes invisible could be taken seriously.  Once it is realized that invisibility does not exist, an outline of how to cure it reveals a great deal about any psychiatrist capable of swallowing such a hoax. When a compulsive playactor succeeded in deluding a gullible psychiatrist that three different persons, each unaware of the others' existence, inhabited her body and took control of it at different times, the result was a book called "The Three Faces of Eve."  The consequence of that book was an epidemic of one-upmanship, with pretentious psychiatrists competing to produce the most personalities in a single patient. Multiple personality disorder does not exist.  It did not exist when the virtual creator of the syndrome asserted that her patient had three personalities.  It did not exist when a psychiatrist who claimed to have a patient with more than 100 personalities was exposed on Sixty Minutes.  It did not exist when a psychiatrist who claimed that his patient had over 500 personalities was exposed in Skeptic magazine.  It did not exist when psychiatrists who recognized that it was making them a laughing stock tried to save face by renaming it dissociative identity disorder.  And it does not exist today. This book is sufficiently different in its perspective from the "Eve" playactor's own book to indicate that the author was more interested in pushing a saleable theory than reporting what her patient really told her.  It differs from the playactor's actual roleplaying.  And it differs from anything that exists outside of the fantasy world inhabited by gullible psychiatrists.  For the original playactor's version, see "I'm Eve" by Chris Sizemore.  For the facts, see "Hoax & Reality:  The Bizarre World of Multiple Personality" by Dr August Piper.  "The Three Faces of Eve" is total, unmitigated FICTION. 
 The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them. It teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well, and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy. I love that this book comes in boardbook form, but I am very dissapointed with the illustrations 
 When it is all said and done about Clinton's Legacy, Gene Lyons has assured himself a place in the Presidential Library by writing such a book. The book does point out several areas that Clinton haters seldom want to  see or believe. For example, regardless how you feel about Bill, you must  admire his ability to not only survive a sad, sordid and disadvantage  childhood but achieved his goals in education, public service and politics.  He did so on his own initiative, using and abusing close friends who also  did the same to him, and focusing on saying anything at anytime that could  help him at that time. Whitewater was a shady inside financial political  deal, made among many politicians with profiteers when the Saving and Loan  sector was deregulated, not just in Arkansas but throughout the country. It  was denied during the campaign and avoided by a phony accounting report  that was needed in the primaries, but proved to be less than accurate after  Clinton was elected president. On one hand, two of Clinton's friends became  upset when the deal went south and felt Clinton abandoned them when he  became president. Now did those friends feel betrayed by Clinton and wanted  to bring him down as the book points out? The author has made a great case  saying so and I believe him. On the other hand, was it the silence of  others who refused to answer pivotal questions whether such meetings with  Clinton took place? This would lead back to the president when he was a  governor and would show he plotted and scheme with them? No doubt about it,  their silence saved this president. Therefore, in the book Gene Lyons wants  us to believe the former but some facts clearly show an investigation was  needed and reported properly by the media contrary to the author's  CONclusions. Either way, 17 convictions including the Solicitor General's  convictions are facts not fiction. The author has been trying to apologize  and justify Clinton's behavior since the impeachment. In the end, no book  using revisionists history is going to exonerate this president's actions  prior to and during the first four years of his presidency that  accomplished more than people expected. At the same time, no book can  change the fact that president Clinton was able to avoid impeachment for  many acts that even his party said can be punishable after these last four  years of absolutely few accomplishments whatsoever. No friend or enemy of  the Clintons' have been able to help or hurt the Clintons' more so than  themselves as well as this book that lives off of a public's poor memory.  The only problem is, when you view the Clinton presidency even after  Whitewater, it is one few can be proud of and the only fool is the one who  claims it had made up scandals to bring them down. Sorry, they did it all  by themselves and still are doing it, to the dismay of the many who support  them, and frustration of those would destroy them. The book is worth  reading to provide an overall view of the Clintons' but it can't change  history 
 this is a helpful book if one is more interested in name dropping than in the clear presentation of critical approaches. the author has a knack for making the obscure even more obscure. more often than not jargon takes the place of analysis 
 This fat volume about food and cooking, packed with anecdotes and trivia and stories, is amusing but completely unreliable.  As a source of information about the history of food, it is useless.  Many of the assertions of fact here are questionable, and none of them are footnoted so you can check them out. The author seems to have taken snippets from here and there (mostly, apparently, from French sources), sorted them thematically, and uncritically assembled them into a continuous text.  No doubt a large proportion of the assertions here are true, but there is no way of telling the difference between the true ones and the others!  What's more, the translation is poor.  Not only are some gallicisms rendered word-for-word (and so only intelligible if you translate them back into French), but there are no translator's notes for topical references.  I cannot recommend this book for anyone seriously interested in the history of food 
 ever been talked down to by a person who you know is no smarter than you? that's what this entire book feels like.  Not even amusing enough to try to finish I think that this book may actually be damaging to the reader.  I was hoping for some light hearted fun female-empowered banter and all I found was a book on how to sound shallow and be nice.  
 This container is way too small to keep any fish in, let alone two. In such a small container, the fishes' wastes will build up quickly, causing eye and skin irritation, sickness, even death. You can try to reduce the waste build up changing the water frequently, but not only is this a lot of work for you, it is stressful for the fish.  In addition, if you want to keep bettas in a divided tank, there should be decorations for the fish to hide behind when they need a break from flaring at each other. This tank is too small to allow that, another source of stress.  Thirdly, bettas are tropical fish. They need a tank heated to a constant 80F. It is not possible to safely heat a tank that is smaller than 5 gallons.  If you want to get bettas, please read some of the excellent websites available and learn all you can about their care. If you cannot afford a proper tank, please don't get a fish 
 I thought this book was boring and too drawn out. It took me over 3 months to read simply because I didn't want to pick it back up! The plot was good...it was different but as with all of Ms. Steel's novels, it is centered around a beautiful rich, successful woman, Isabella, who has some sort of tragedy and we read about her sadness and depression for most of the book until she finally meets someone to help her pick up the shattered pieces of her broken heart. This book is very, very slow and I found myself falling asleep every time I read it. I would not reccommend it. She has better novels out there 
 Jo-Ellan Dimitrius has written a HORRIBLE book. Do not buy this goofy junk.  Only buy it if you like killers walking around free and  killing your children. 
 I would like to cordially invite Dr. John Gray to visit and work in the public school system, of which many campuses are run exclusively by women. These women can be very matter-of-fact, get-down-to-business and get-the-job-done.  Those gals are there to work.  Some of them try to bond emotionally and some do not.  But they get their jobs done.  They often have to do things they don't "feel" like doing, but they do it and they do it darned well.    I think the best cross-gender communication, whether at work or socially, can be as follows;  1.  Listen as well as talk. 2.  Respect the other person's views. 3.  Don't try to make a psychological statement about another person's style, whether male or female. 4.  Don't hog the limelight. 5.  Respond with empathy. 6.  Park your ego outside the door.  In other words, practice GOOD MANNERS!  It works every time 
 The one star I gave this schlock is for the readability of the prose. At least that has substance.  As for the actual content . . . Take Marxist revolutionary theory, give it a plot and a timeline, and you have this book. The author actually used the word "bourgeoisie" as a prosaic tool. Bourgeoisie? Please.  Granted it was written some 15 years ago, before the events of 1989-90 played themselves out.  Still, the fact that this howler wasn't immediately recalled en masse is illustrative.  Don't waste your money 
 This is called a book, but written in the form of a blog.  I was reading Fidel and instead of facts about the dictator or his rule, I was bombarded with a rant about the evil of the left and hollywood in America.  Instead of true history this is a partisan rant 
 The main point of this book is well supported with examples from "innovative" organizations.  However, I was continually under the impression that this was a 30 page research paper converted into a 200 page book.  How did the author accomplish this feat?  Repeat, repeat, repeat.  This book is full of redundancies, repetitions, summaries, and introductions that are all superfluous.  When you're done reading this book, you will know the examples of good innovators by heart because they are repeated in every chapter, sometimes multiple times 
 Walk on the wild side. Good song ! Everything else is just a cheap imatation of Lou Reed a 1 hit wonder. Yeah, I wonder why he didn't stop while he was ahead ? 
  I was getting dog food at Sams today, and  while waltzing by the book isle I noticed the new The Bible Experience audio bible. The cover is mostly a list of names, famous and not so famous actors, musicians, pastors ect,  Obviously a strong selling point of this bible is who it is read by you dig?    It is published by Zondervan, the largest bible publishing house in the world, they produce the NIV among many other versions, and have a very good reputation for what they sell, or at least they did.    I read through he names, Denzel Washington, Samuel L Jackson, TD Jakes, Cuba Gooding Jr. Forrest Whitaker the list goes on for a long way and includes just about every famous African American celebrity you can think of.     Ive heard some of these folks read other audio books, and I was excited at the prospect of them reading the bible.  So I bought it, and hurried out the car to give it a spin.   Disapointment.   The voice acting is actually very good. Better than any other audio bible Ive listened to. Unfortunately the editing and production are very poor.    There is never any space between the narration and the speaking parts, that half second pause that you look for at the end of a sentence is not there and it is really annoying. Instead of   Jesus said to them, who do you say I am? and Peter replied You are the Messiah  It sounds like this:  Jesus said to themWho do you say I amand Peter repliedYou are the Messiah      Its really bad, and consistent throughout. Now since this is a cast recording, and all the parts are done at different times ect, that means that the producers then spliced all the tracks back together. That means that they had complete control over those pauses, from a millisecond to a minute if they choose. The only thing I can think of is that they shortened the pauses to save on the overall time. And they probably did, it might be a 20 CD set otherwise, all those little pauses add up.    And by doing so they all but ruined the project. Then they added the score and background noises. And did an even worse job at that. The music is way over done. Scoring, when done correctly can really set the mood, draw out the feeling of a passage and turn the common phrase into a real moment.    Or they can be too much and distract from the text. Guess which one these do  And then there are the background noises. Dude seriously. What were you thinking? This isnt 1940s comedy radio theater. When the characters in the text are supposed to be near the water, it sounds like they are surfing.    And here is what really did it for me, in Romans 14 (my favorite) where it talks about not judging your brother because his idea of worship is different than yours and it uses the eating of certain foods as a metaphor, mind you this is not a table scene like the last supper, this an intellectual discourse,  they have the sound of people eating. I dont mean a little glass clinking table noise kind of thing, I mean CHEWING it sounds like the guy is ripping into a piece of celery.  But wait, the best is yet to come  However, the big names, the real selling point of this bible  are all in the Old Testament.   Which is not a bad thing  EXCEPT THAT IT WONT BE RELEASED UNTIL NEXT YEAR.   OK here is the analogy. You go to the store and buy a CD that says Ultimate Blues Collection, featuring: BB King, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Ray Charles,  Bo Diddly, ect ect With bonus DVD!  Then you get the CD home, put it in the player and none of those artists are one the CD.   What's going on you think? so you look at the liner notes, nothing there, they say the same thing as the cover. So you put in the special bonus DVD which shows an 8 minute  making of feature again it shows all the stars, but you notice something, all the stars are playing songs that are not on this CD hmm that is strange   Then you look way down at the bottom of the menu, and there is says Complete Artist listing, so you wait while it scrolls down and down and down, maybe you just missed the big names, there are 18 CDs after all, down down down,   and then is says, Part two, to be released next year! BB King, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Ray Charles,  Bo Diddly, ect ect  I expect this kind of marketing dishonesty form the mainstream media. It is all part of the game. But this is worse than any bait and switch trickery I have ever scene, and the fact that it has been done with a bible makes my furious.    Yes those big names are part of the overall project But they are not part of this product, and nothing, anywhere on the packaging, inside or out makes that clear, or even unclear, in fact all the packaging is designed specifically to make you think that they ARE part of this product.   Im very disappointed in the folks who put this together. I could live with the poor production, even the celery crunching, but the feeling that I got taken while buying A BIBLE will not be lived with.   Its going back tomorrow. Im writing Zondervan, (not that they will care) and Im publishing this on Amazon and any other site that will let me review.   This is so wrong.   -Justus      
 In this classical Romeo and Juliet tale, Tita (Lumi Cavazos) and Pedro (Hunky-Marco Leonardi) seem destined to marry until her evil-hearted mother Elena (Regina Torne), forbids it because of some silly family tradition. Tita, the youngest, is to take care of Elena until she dies. So, she marries Pedro off to her daughter Rosaura(Yareli Arizmendi). Pedro's reasoning is that he can be near Tita but it presents a host of problems. Tragedies beset this family as well. The lovers though, overcome all of it and after Rosaura's death--finally have the chance to express their love for each other. But, how tragic--so enters FATE. This is a foreign film with English subtitles. And, this review refers to the 105 minute DVD. At first I gave it two stars, but it's perhaps a four star movie for drama and effects. But, Beware of Nudity 
 The biggest dissapointment I had with getting this book is that I purchased the Microsoft Reader Version.  One is led to believe that one can highlight, cut and paste, etc., by using this new tool for reading.  Actually, all you get is electronic pages that are inert.  They cannot be printed, one cannot cut and paste from them, all one can do is stare at them on the screen.  In order to transfer the print from screen to one's computer, one must first copy (by hand) the print, re-type it on screen into another program, then save.  In other words, the e-version, for the researcher is not only ABSOLUTELY USELESS, it DOUBLES THE AMOUNT OF WORK ONE MUST DO TO EXCERPT MATERIAL FROM A BOOK. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF PERSON MICROSOFT HAD IN MIND WHEN THEY CREATED THIS INFLEXIBLE PRODUCT.  IT IS CERTAINLY A DISASTER FOR ME, AND I INTEND TO REQUEST A REFUND ON MY "DIGITAL PURCHASE" SINCE ALL I PURCHASED WAS AN INERT, DOUBLE-THE-WORK TO READ AND EXCERPT BOOK.  WHAT A DISASTER!  WHAT AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER.  IT SORT OF MAKES ONE WONDER WHY THEY EVEN WENT TO THE TROUBLE TO CREATE THIS PRODUCT.  
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 I didn't like the book Freak The Mighty. I just like it at all. It was a book that I never would have read if it weren't for our class Literature Circle. I didn't like it because it was a book that didn't have a good plot, and it jumps around alot 
 I was disappointed that on some items the photography doesn't show the color(s) of the item.  All the yarns listed in the patterns are identified by numbers so there isn't any way to tell what color family they refer to.  There is no description, nor pictures, of the yarns in the back of the book to help out with the deciphering.  One shawl looks golden because it was photographed from below against the sun.  I saw that shawl at a yarn store and they said they used the colors listed in the pattern and the colors were nothing close to the ones in the picture (and they were appalling).  There are some innovative designs in the book, but I can't imagine anyone wearing them (do you wear knitted form-fit multi-colored slacks?). I don't think this book shows off Koigu yarns very well.  The yarns are actually quite lovely. If it weren't for the Oriental Jacket I would have returned the book to Amazon 
 I purchased this book looking for information on specific methods of financing my pre-startup with little of my own money.  I read the book in it's entirety and here is what it is:  A wonderful personal story of winning and losing in business.  It shows that creativity can be used to overcome lack of cash, but gives few useful ideas.  Like I said, it's just a nice story, not a business resource 
 Stunningly bad, Die Another Day is an incomprehensible bucket of slops with a script written by a roomful of 12 year olds and directed by a gross incompetent. It takes a lot to make Madonna look like a shop window mannequin, but this film does it. It appears to be about diamonds, or North Koreans, or Cuba, or something. Look elsewhere 
 For any number of reasons I can probably say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand that a lot of people think this is genius. I am not one of them. Personally, I don't find endless descriptions of sex with minority boys to be very entertaining reading, let alone genius. I also don't find pointless prose that appears to have no discernable thread of thought to have much value. Personally, I like to read good story tellers, authors like Tom Robbins or Salman Rushdie. Naked Lunch is about as opposed to them as you can reasonably get.  This is one of those books that sounds a lot better when someone translates it for you. In reading the preface where Norman Mailer talks about it in the context of the court proceedings in the 1960s, the book sounds interesting and culturally pertinent. However, upon reading it the book falls far short of the lofty status we get from Mailer's answers on the stand. I understand how Alan Ginsberg, a proclaimed NAMBLA member, would find it's material suitable. I wonder about Mailer though. While I'll never take a stand against a person's writing what they want, I do take pause when someone recommends something like this.  This is not literature so much as a heroin clouded view of the author's own serious problems and his interpretation of our culture's deficiencies. The notion that this is the "naked" truth, or lunch as it is so called, is so absurd that the book should never have been accepted as remotely resembling cult literature, in the past, present, or future. Who reads this and resonates with it? Who thinks, "Yes, gay sex with boys is what my mind is all about? Oh, and all the better that they're Arabs!" Very few people, the author included. Burroughs himself admits this was difficult to write. This is probably due to the fact that the vignettes portrayed here do not, in fact, represent anything so much as the anarchy resplendent in the author's own mind while he struggled with various addictions. As a case study in heroin and morphine addiction, this may have some merit. As a counterculture commentary on society I find it worthless.  This isn't about my sensibilities being assaulted - far from it. If I can read & enjoy Robbins's linguistic forays into sex with nuns, I can handle just about anything. I'm not offended with flying sperm so much as I am insulted that anyone felt this was worth reading; that I was lured into thinking this was a work of art. It's not.   Sometimes I read books that don't suit me, but I understand why someone would like it. This book falls squarely in the camp where people feel they need to proclaim it genius because they're so confused or intimidated by it. This book is far from genius. The author admits it was put together from scraps of things written while he was in his heavy heroin addiction, and that he vaguely remembers much of it. I don't see how, or in what context, this book will appeal to anyone other than a case study of a certain segment of people at a certain instance in time in America 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 Although I love the original Holmes stories that I read growing up, invariably I am disappointed when I try one of the Holmes stories written by others. Being a fan of mysteries with supernatural overtones, I thought I would try this. But I gave up long before the ghost (or whatever) was introduced -- before they even arrived in Scotland, in fact. Talk, talk, talk, even when there was some action. This has convinced me to reread Doyle's books if I am in the mood for a Sherlock Holmes story, and not try any of the imitators 
 this is a great book...if you 15 and you've finaly run out of ravenwolf books to read ...otherwise...save your money.  While some of his visualization excersises are interesting, its pretty obvious, even before you read the rest of his books, that he's building up to admiting he's not a wiccan or even pagan, he's heading for satanist...or a drug treatment center, whichever comes first. And I have no problem with that, but lets call this what it is...pandering to disafected teenagers, angsty 20 somethings and bitter 30's. If you need something to put on your coffee table to annoy visiting Jehovah's witneses or to scare your parents...this is the author and these are the books, but if your looking for useful information.. its not in here 
 A cynical grab for more moolah. "Wow! These guys are real rebels with something real to say!" Sorry, this re-recording exposes them as the poseurs they apparently always were. Hey guys, how about writing some NEW music? Oh, that's right. Whatever spark you had went out decades ago.    I'm sure I would still have a good time seeing them live, but sadly, they have turned into a nostalgia act. Even the cover is a tired, boring re-hash. This GIFT should be returned 
 This book had perhaps a little too much hype to live up to and as a result I was slightly disappointed in the final result. Its well written but the writing stile is a little more accademic than other books in Appress's  "practical" series. Some of the code examples are lacking in commentary or explanation. 
 Ok I gotta start off by saying this is without a doubt one of the WORST movies I have ever seen, if there was a zero on that star scale thats what it would be getting, how anyone got this horrible film made is beyond me. First off, what a concept for a movie, a man who runs around with a drill and kills random people on the street! The storyline was weak and there were plotholes everywhere. Half the movie was made up of unnessecary scenes that were just there to fill time such as: the random lesbian shower scene, the annoying shots of the band practising and the disgusting scene where Reno chops up the rabbit. The reason for Reno's sudden insanity is hardley explained, he just starts drilling bums on the street, oh and by the way I think it might take a little more then one drill hole in the stomach to kill someone! And whats up with the red screen! That was just annoying! This movie is honestly horrible in every single aspect, it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and all copies of it should be destoryed! Just to make this clear to everyone I am a huge horror movie fan, this movie was just a sorry excuse for a film. The director should hang his head in shame. Cult status for this movie? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE! How anyone can like this is beyond me! Trust me, dont touch this movie with a ten ft pole!  
 This book stands in direct opposition to Loosing Ground by Charles Murray.  However, where Murray's argument is solid and convincing, Wilson's is riddled with gaps and broad assumptions 
 Ok theres only like 4 good songs on this cd: Megalomanic, Pistola, Sick Sad Little World and Zee Deevel. The rest of the songs are slow and void of interest, theres nothing that really takes off. Its a slow and more mainstreamed approach to rock. I love the other two incubus cds i have: Make Yourself and Morning View but this one just doesnt sit right with me. If you like the other two cds you may not like this, You have been warned but if you like soft jazz rock which never really lifts off the ground and feel like sleeping bring your pillow and a cd player and this cd and drift off to sleep. BTW (The look on your face after reading this review was 'PRICELESS' 
 This MAY be a good product for the occasional user. However, if your small business depends on this, you are dead. This baby will crash, crash, crash on you...even with the latest firmware. Nice idea to build a wireless router that supports VPN tunnels, but in reality, it just does not work. Look at the other reviews and think. Why does everybody say stay away? There must be something wrong if this many people complain. I live in Japan, and the Japanese retailers have already pulled it from the shelves due to the number of complaints. This is the SECOND time mine has locked up today. It WILL be replaced 
 I had always meant to get around to Eric Alterman's "What Liberal Media?" but had never had that wonderful intersection of a public library close by and the chance to waste my time on some stupid reading.  Well, I finally got both and enjoyed Alterman's book so much I began searching for other liberal reading on the subject and stumbled onto "Tailgunner" Joe Conason's "Big Lies."  I actually know little about Tailgunner Joe.  During the Clinton years of course I knew him as a propagandist for the White House, a reliable shill because of a lack of formal connection to the Clintonistas.  His best-known book is "The Hunting of the President," in which Clinton is portrayed as someone sort of walking down the street minding his own business when he's suddenly mugged by a bunch of right-wing thugs.  Definitely an "alt-history" novel.  To properly understand Big Lies, you've got to start off putting yourself into Tailgunner Joe's mindset to get an idea of what he thinks "liberal" and "conservative" mean in the first place.  If the man thinks that NPR is "politically balanced" (p 47), that ought to tell you something about his understanding of what is mainstream.  Now, as for the book itself.  The big lies start early and often, with comments like "Conservatives enjoy their virtual monopoly over the nation's political conversation...because -- unlike the supposedly mainstream media -- conservatives are perfectly willing to stifle opposition" (p 1) and "the most basic liberal values are political equality and economic opportunity" (p 2) and "liberals...regard the freedoms enumerated in the Bill of Rights as essential to the expression of popular consent" (pp 2-3).  The only thing stifled was my laughter when I read these passages.  For example, when's the last time a liberal defended the second amendment, or the ninth, or the tenth?  However, the book doesn't continue on that vein for long.  Big Lies is not so much an expos on the vast right-wing propaganda machine, but rather an extensive political tract of, to paraphrase Orwell, "conservatives b-a-a-a-d, liberals g-o-o-o-d."  It's similar to the Al Franken-Michael Moore-Molly Ivans books you see in the bargain bin at Barnes and Noble.  Most of the book (pp 53-212) is a rehash of the supposed sins of Republicans in general (the Depression, deficits, Iran-Contra, hypocrisy, overall meanness for cutting taxes for the rich, etc. etc.) and George W. Bush (Harkin Energy, Enron, TANG, Carlyle Group, cutting taxes for the rich, etc, etc,).  Tailgunner Joe even goes so far as to say that liberals fought the Revolution and to free the slaves, while conservatives were Tories and slavers (pp 69-70).  I'm not joking.  Admittedly, Tailgunner Joe does have some good points about the mainstream media and its political leanings.  He claims, for example, that more newspapers endorsed Bush in 2000 than Gore, including more major dailies (pp 39-40).  I found that surprising.  Assuming it's true.  He also claimed Lexis-Nexus searches reveal less, or no, labeling bias like that claimed by Bernard Goldberg (p 33).  I was surprised by that as well.  Assuming it's true.  But the book is weighed down by its errors.  Tailgunner Joe is a much better writer than Eric Alterman, but like Eric, Joe has a troubled relationship with facts.  When he's slinging mud, he's pretty good, because, after all, whether Rush Limbaugh is "xenophobic" (p 23) or the religious right is "openly hostile to the nation's traditional ideals of liberty" (p 96) or President Bush's political philosophy is "un-American" (p 184) is a matter of opinion.  But when Joe makes reference to actual facts, well, that's where he runs into problems.  Here are a few examples.  *  "survey evidence...suggests that Americans are still more liberal than conservative" (p 4).  Tailgunner Joe references the polls of the National Election Studies Guide to back up this claim (p 213), but a review of the actual polls he cites show conservatives consistently outpolling liberals (35% to 23% in the most recent survey).  You have to ask yourself whether Joe thought his audience would be too stupid or too lazy to actually verify his claims.  He probably thought we were both.  Meanwhile, according to the August 2004 Battleground poll, 60% of Americans considered themselves "very conservative" or "somewhat conservative" while only 35% considered themselves "very liberal" or "somewhat liberal."  *  "No conservative presidential candidate has won a majority of the popular vote since 1988" (p 7).  Now I suppose we can forgive Tailgunner Joe for this since he wrote his Big Lies in 2003, before Bush won re-election with 51% of the popular vote, but it does cast some doubt on his analytical abilities and his conclusions, does it not?  *  "But the conservative press would never publish a liberal equivalent to George Will" (p 50).  In response, two words: Al Hunt.  * Max Cleland is a "Medal of Honor winner" (p 67).  First, one does not "win" a Medal of Honor, one is *awarded* or *receives* the Medal of Honor.  See, e.g., 38 U.S.C. 1560(b).  But I suppose I shouldn't quibble with Tailgunner Joe trying to comprehend military parlance; it's foreign territory to him and he's doing the best he can.  Second, Max Cleland is not a recipient of the Medal of Honor, but rather the Silver Star.  There's a world of difference between the two.  To get the Silver Star about all you have to do is shoot a fleeing foreigner in the back.  To be awarded the Medal of Honor takes extreme bravery.  There's also the matter of distortions.  Big Lies is full of them, so I'll confine myself to some of the most obvious.  *  Most Washington-based journalists "identify their own politics as `centrist'" (p 40).  That may be true, but it's also true that *three times* as many journalists identify themselves as liberal as conservative (54% self-identify as "moderate," 22% as liberal and 7% as conservative; Pew Research Center poll, May 2004).  Taking that fact in, and that fact that journalists in general probably want to maintain the fiction of political neutrality, it's no surprise that a majority of journalists claim to be "moderate."  *  "Journalists generally reflect the same spectrum of viewpoints as any other group of college-educated, upper-middle-income, urban and suburban Americans" (p 41).  Assuming that's true, and assuming that this voting group is liberal (and it is, particularly in NYC, Washington and L.A., where the most influential journalists live), does that not disprove Joe's entire sub-thesis of "there's no mainstream liberal media"?  *  Tailgunner Joe finds it mystifying that John Ashcroft would be anointed in a manner "imitating the behavior of...ancient Hebrew kings" (p 99).  Let me help Joe out of his intellectual box.  A commandment to anoint is given to all saints in the New Testament, specifically James 5:14, when the Christian needs a blessing of health. (Aside: I had a liberal Jewish friend comment about this anointing to me in 2001.   My response: "Mark, what do you think of a vice-presidential candidate who, for religious reasons, one day a week cannot flip on a light switch?"  As you might imagine, that was the end of *that* conversation).  *  Terry McAuliffe's miraculous stock trade with Global Crossing is acceptable because Terry "did nothing illegal" (p 153), but Tailgunner Joe has no problem smearing the actions of Republicans involved in Enron (pp 149-152), even though they did nothing illegal either.  It's good to see an enunciation of a moral standard from a liberal, even a Klintonesque, legalistic one, but now if he'd stop being such a hypocrite by applying shifting standards to his enemies.  *  Tailgunner Joe constantly complains about right-wing buzz-phrases like "compassionate conservative" (p 177) and maybe he's got a point, but he indulges in the worst sort of left-wing clichd buzz-phrases himself, like "working families" (p 188).  What -- a "working family" has to be a family where both parents work?  Do all the kids have to work too?  Do the infants?  Does the family dog?  Give me a freakin' break.  *  There was "no lack of zeal" in Clinton's hunt for bin Laden (p 205).  Like the zeal in turning down the opportunity -- twice -- to kill or capture him in the mid-90s?  Tailgunner Joe has a peculiar definition of "zeal."  Sort of like Clinton's definition of "alone."  *  "Stringent anti-terrorism legislation" when proposed by Clinton is good (p 207) but when proposed by George Bush it is helping create a "nascent military regime" (p 102).  So read Big Lies for a few slivers of actual fact, and a few chuckles, and as a case study on use of invective.  But don't read it thinking your going to get an expos on the vast right-wing media conspiracy.  Tailgunner Joe Conason turned out to be a lot like that other Tailgunner Joe: fighting a rearguard action against real and imaginary enemies, to questionable effect 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 He doesn't deserve that Nobel.... It was a political decision 
 The strongest song of the whole film, without a doubt, is the Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter".  Of course, the soundtrack doesn't include it 
 This phone seems to have great potential, but does NOT work with VOIP (Internet phone). This is a known issue - perhaps because Siemens sells a VOIP-adapter version of this phone (you use that phone with the built-in VOIP adapter). I loved the color display and the phone number list was easy to work with and easy to use. Drat that it wouldn't work with my VOIP setup (which is why I bought it). Also - watch for steep return / restock charges - it was cheaper for me to give this phone as a gift than to return it 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 Reference picture quality on HD-DVD.  Basically unwatchable though.  I would not recommend the blind buy on this one.  
 Just like the old Chariots of Gods, his books are very interesting and and entertaining.  But please dont think that you are reading a scientific work.  Real historical works are not as sexy and entertaining as these books just as real archeologists are not Indiana Joneses.  
 I love trance music, that style of dance music with fast, continuous beats and rich electronic sounds, and often sweet sounding vocals, usually female vocals.  So I thought I'd like this album.  Well, I do like it musically.  It's not great, but it's good trance music.  But the lyrics ruin the album for me.  Most of the songs exude a bitterness toward love relationships or a cynicism that love will never work out.  Here are lyrical samples from the CD:  "Maybe you're better off without me." "I'm wide awake, it's time to make it on my own; the dream is over." "We wanted love to last forever, but something's missing...I can't find words to break your fall, when 'Goodbye' says it all." "It gets lonely, but I have no other choice...no one sees my dreams falling all apart...I've been blinded by your lies.  I never knew love could be so wrong." "Tell me why you can't feel the things I do...I made the same mistakes I know I'll make again...It meant nothing to you, you'll never understand, it meant nothing to you, the touch of my hand." "November's here again, raining down on me, I disappear again..." "It seems like every [scrub?] I see is trying to get it on with me, they think it impresses me, the way they act so foolishly...I don't care, I never liked you anyway...You're a total waste of time."  If these lyrics fit your life, and you like trance music, you'll probably like this album.     I do like the remake of A-Ha's "The Sun Always Shines On TV."  It's not better than A-Ha's 8-minute remix version, but it's nice to hear an old favorite with a new flavor.  This album has three mixes of the song, none of them significantly different from the other.  I also like the instrumental track, "Blown Away." These tracks are enjoyable, and a couple others have pretty nice lyrics, but the album as a whole I find too depressing 
 The first Dr. Sears book I read was "The Baby Book", which I found helpful and somewhat insightful as many other parents that are gentle in raising their children. But I became very turned off by this book and the entire Dr. Sears following that has thousands of parents looking to him as the guru of child care. This book, like all the others in the "Sears library" of books is a carbon copy of his other books and reiterates the same beliefs. He uses this book as a medium to promote his attachment parenting beliefs and uses the title "the successful child" to make parents believe that his parenting beliefs are the rule rather than the exception. Yes, I know that Dr. Sears has eight kids and is a well renowned pediatrician, but that doesn't make him the authority on parenting and child development and other issues that he has written books on including family nutrition, pregnancy, and childbirth, and to suggest so would make his books utterly self-congratulatory other than proven techniques that work across the board. I hope the parents of his patients don't feel that they have to conform to his beliefs in terms of how they choose to raise their children. It is good to take what is useful to you as a parent from various sources such as this book; but I refuse to see Dr. Sears as an authority on my child's development and on my role as a parent just because he has written dozens of books that are regurgitations of each other. As a parent, you must learn to think for yourself as well as seek out information from other sources 
 Having been a quant, it occured to me that I could develop a Monte Carlo football simulator, then back test it according to different betting strategies by running simulated games thousands of times over using previous statistical data.  Two things went wrong.  One, I bought this book which I found helped me learn little about sports betting.  Two, a company of quants has just introduced earlier this year a Monte Carlo simulator (Statshark) and for a montly fee, you can pay for their predicition services.  Alex Alaniz   1.

 This book provides valuable information  necessary to facilitate the needs of ELLs in the classroom.  It describes strategies that are useful for all levels of English Language Learners and explains the rationales for using them.  The book also presents teaching scenarios from real classrooms that use the SIOP model in order to further understand the strategies in depth. 
 When i got the gun i took it outside to shoot it and it went about 2 or 3 yards. It is still a good gun for 00.01!!!! 
 I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell. 
 Some decent stuff, but he barely mentions ETFs, which are becoming a bigger piece of the asset puzzle. And his cavalier negativity of index funds (also mentioned in his prior books) is incorrect.  He needs to read the Arnott study in the Journal of Portfolio Management (26, no. 4, 2000). However, his points on diversification and rebalancing are on target 
 I tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that I put it down in frustration.  It reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat. The theme is interesting, the execution poor.  Cannot recommend 
 Marcuse has long been a favorite of intellectuals and for good reason - his ideas brought about the rise of the Left on college campuses and made acceptable the practice of allowing only acceptable views a hearing.  Dissenting opinions are to be silenced. His idea of societal/cultural Marxism seems slightly nutty and a tad romantic - one of those theories worked out by tenured professors over a second glass of brandy at the local pub. But Marcuse is anything but flippant - he is dead serious.  He is also a contradiction.  At once didactic (he's German)and eccentric, he also (like Freud) played the part of the gifted bourgeoise trapped amid a swill of nonentities. He has never refrained from advocating a dictatorship of the elite who would guide/help/force the stupid masses. For some reason, he thought undisciplined, nomadic students would lead that vanguard. And in a sense they did - by entering politics, academia or the media.  His disciples are classic "NPR" types - highly educated, white, well-heeled and immersed in political ideology.   One cannot underestimate his influence.  His theories led to several current movements (quote unquote): Deconstructionism, the Marxist interpretation of language, Political art, identity politics, group (gender/ethnic) over individual rights, the new Primitivism (radical environmentalism/animal rights) and last but not least, violence as an acceptable political response.    Despite the shrill denunciation of Western culture he chose to remain behind enemy lines, never venturing to Marxist lands for study where critical works of this kind would not be permitted. This is the paradox: Critical writers would not be allowed in a Marcusian society since "wrong" ideas are not permitted. Like Chomsky or Vidal or even the clownish Michael Moore, he walked among the very peoples he denounced.  The thesis of the book - typically Marxist - is the plight of the worker brought up to date by Marcuse.  We learn of the horrors of capitalism and the hope for a brighter future. But would his society of mind-numbing politicalization make individuals richer in spirit and more fulfilled?   One aspect of Marcuse I've always admired is his brutal honesty. Unlike other theorists he openly advocates violence when it is necessary to achieve a political goal.  He embraced the students who rioted in the 60's but unlike other letists he was never fooled by the common worker - they would never willingy accept his societal vision. He says (repeatedly) "They must be taught".  This work is very 1950sh, especially the parts with the outdated Freudian allusions.  It reads like a religious tract that quotes  ancient writings as the best answer for current problems. One must remember that this was written when Marxism was still taken seriously in some quarters.  Its effects remain with us today.   
 I found myself nodding off and wondering "when does this story start".   Several pages to just describe a dog? And very little communication written with the family members.  (who all went to war but little was said about their time there?).   Just Agnes and her boring thinking about Warren and the Scofield's and Uncle Leo (who??) who live near each other. (again little or no comnunication).   Dew can't even make Will sound interesting!   This  book is a "DUD".   Compare it to Lynn Austin's "A Woman's Place" which takes place in the 1940's and you'll find a book you can't put down, with interaction between people and descriptive places and events. This is the first and last Robb Forman Dew's book I'll read! 
 I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.    The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly 
 I love Victor Hugo's writting ability. No one can write confrontational scenes better than him. I believe his book Les Miserables is the best fictional book that has ever been written, bar none. I also love the Hunchback of Notre Dame, to me it's one of the top five to ten books that I have ever read.   Anyone who has read any of his books knows that the climaxes of his books are extraordinary.... no one comes close. No one can write confrontational scenes better than him. They also know that his writting is more beautiful than just about any other author who has ever lived.   People who have read Victor Hugo's books also know that he likes to go off on tangents that get away from the story for numerous pages. For instance, in Les Miserables he goes on for countless pages describing the convent and the sewer system. These tangents that he loves to go on are extremly unnecesary and take away from the story in his books but you deal with them because the story is worth it.  The Toilers of the Sea is also a great story but the book is so marred with these tangets and over explanation of EVERYTHING that it just totally bogs the book down. It's a good story but not good enough to fight through everything.   The first half of the book is very difficult to get through, the first fifty or so pages is just an explanation of the surrounding islands... the next 150 pages or so are overkill explanations of the plot and seeting it up. I honestly don't believe half of the people who start this book will make it to page 200 unless they are forced to for a school project etc.   The next 230 pages are a lot more interesting but Victor Hugo's over explaining every detail and his constantly annoying habbit of saying the same thing ten different ways really makes this book difficult and rather boring.  Gillete, the main character is really a awesome character (he reminds me of Jean ValJean in Les Miserables)and there really is a good story here about him, Deruchette, Senior Clubin and Miss Leherity (I'm probably buthering the spellings.... sorry) but I honestly think very few people will make it through the book. If Victor would have had an editor who could have helped clean this up and shorten it I think it would have been a lot better.  P.S. I also hated the ending.... what Gillete did to himself at the end of the book just totally annoyed me 
 After watching "Anthropophagus- The Grim Reaper", I came away with mixed feelings.  On the one hand, "Anthropohagus" had its moments (albeit quite few) where it was somewhat chilling.  The Anthropohagus, himself, was rather effectively creepy as a horror movie villain.  Some scenes did fairly well building up to a moment of horror, but the problem is that these effective moments of horror are few and far between.  Unfortunately, the majority of this movie is beset with horrible acting and a very cheaply made horror movie, and for some reason, it is just very difficult to get over this fact in "Anthropophagus" probably because these weaknesses are so glaring.    "Anthropophagus" may even have outdone itself with some of the gore scenes, so the gore-hound shouldn't be disappointed with this flick.  However, with that being said, "Anthropophagus" simply is not all that scary except for the few moments that deliver a scare or two to the audience, and even those moments are fairly pedestrian when compared to the classic horror movies we have come to know and love.  Ultimately, what you have in "Anthropophagus" is horrible acting, a poorly written screenplay, uneven and poorly developed plot and action, below average plot execution, just a couple of scary moments, some laughable scenes, a fairly decent amount of gore and an absolutely disgusting, deplorable and depraved scene of violence (fetus scene) that really crosses all boundaries of horror movies that I've ever seen and which really offers nothing as far as the merits of the movie are concerned and certainly offers nothing to cinematic horror.  If that kind of thing appeals to you, this could be right up your alley, but it doesn't do much for me.  I would rather find a really compelling storyline and a scary movie that delivers atmospheric tension, suspense and a scary story, and you simply do not get that in "Anthropophagus".  To answer a few questions that could be asked about this movie...did "Anthropophagus" bother me? No.  Did I think it was scary?  Certainly not, laughable at some points in the movie but not scary, and nor did I find it disturbing.  However, it can certainly be said that what else do you expect from a low-budget Italian-made horror flick? Touche!    In my search for a great horror movie lost in the annals of cinematic horror like a needle in a haystack, what did I find in "Anthropophagus" but another shock and gore horror movie with horrible acting and a barely watchable storyline.  Indeed, it is very difficult to give this movie any credit.  A word of advice, if you have to try to make yourself like a horror movie even after repeated viewings (like I did with this one), it probably just sucks.  For all intents and purposes, that is the case with "Anthropophagus-The Grim Reaper".  Nevertheless, sadly, I've seen much, much worse. 
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 I personally think this book (actually having read it impartially) is not good for any Information Security professional, corporate or government (IA, IAM, IASO, ISSO, ect), but, if you had to place it in any category I guess it would be in the business management end of communication compliance (maybe for a Policy Compliance Officer).  Also I really think that some of the other reviewers here must have been working to promote this book.  I unfortunately say this because the author creates entirely too many unique and extremely complex management policy theories on communication development, which frankly gets way off the subject of INFOSEC, and even has him chasing his own tail in the narrated scenarios.  The author even goes so far as to concoct and create possibly 20-30 new acronyms (as if you didn't have enough already as a real INFOSEC professional), which almost became a little comedic by the end of the book, especially when hearing even the author try recap each chapter and make each new theory tie into another new theory.  Although I'm sure the author is a very distinguished professional in his own right, I unfortunately found this book weak to incorporate into any of my perceived Information Security plans.  Do yourself a favor and skip this one and move onto the next, and make sure the books you choose on this topic do not try to reinvent the wheel 
 I couldn't make it through this CD.   It's so interesting how those who label themselves as "true" or "honest" or "from the heart" or (most ironic of all) "rebel" all seemed to be churned out of the same Wal-Mart-like mill of conformity. Country music has become flat-out depressing (this from a fan!). It has become so utterly predictable, so utterly bland, so utterly the same. "Regular guys" like Church really don't need to play their music. We already know what's going to come out of their mouths way before they sing a note.  Country music has become, sadly, a celebration of ignorance and intolerance, of W. and his war, of wrapping the cross in the flag (which is blasphemy, of course), of every man for himself (while simultaneously claiming to follow Jesus). Eric Church is just the latest carrier of that ignorant, dangerous message. It's just plain sad.  Oh, and it makes for really bad art 
 The CD came without a CD case and the CD did not play.  I am very disappointed 
 Do not waste your money in this movie.  The story is flawless, there is no chemistry between the main characters and their acting is terrible.  There are gaps in the story and the viewer just can not find any interest in any character main or secondary.  Minnie Driver's acting is decent but she can not save the movie by her own 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 I worked in an independent outpatient facility in the early 1970's, when Al Lowen was publishing, which ought to give you some idea of the focus involved.  Bioenergetics had something to commend it, especially in the 70's, and still does, for people who are experiencing day-to-day stress (so what's new?).  But I do not see where the long-term benefit can be had for someone who is really ill: anorexic, paranoid, or psychotic.  As with a volcano, venting helps yet doesn't solve the underlying turmoil.  As a daily anger (or other) management tool it may be a bandaid but I do not believe it helps in the long run. I can personally testify that bioenergetics did nothing for me, although admittedly my exposure was not consistent. 35 years after the fact, I'm in conventional therapy as well as pharmaceutical treatment for issues that arose while I was working at the facility, aa was my tormentor 
 Okay, I'm going to go against the grain here and say that Suttree really isn't all that good.  Maybe it's fine literature -- although personally I don't think so; I think literature should engage and tell a story that the reader can feel part of, absorbed into with a pathos for its characters, good or bad.  Here we get only snatches of that.  *At times* we feel akin to Suttree.  For example the prison segment is good; there is a sense of purpose and pace here absent from the rest of the book; but on the whole Suttree is a rambling and confusing mess.  Why struggle so much with a book?  It's not that the ideas are so incredibly complex -- sure, at times it's sublime -- but it has a purposefully disconnected storyline.  The reader is meant to feel in the dark and only slowly pick up on the context and setting of the scenes.  The relationship between Suttree and Harrogate is great, but there needs to be more of it -- I feel like saying "yeah, yeah, yeah, just bring me back to the friendship between those two and give us more development of Suttree's mysterious past."  If you want to read this, you have been warned.  You will probably be bored and frustrated a good deal of the time.  Page after page of how someone shaves or combs their hair sound interesting?  If you think it's worth it "in the name of literature", then that's up to you.    Note: I have read Blood Meridian and thought it was an excellent book: definitely go read that one first.  And I read A Child of God, which was also great.  I was hoping to become more of a Cormac McCarthy fan reading this one, but I think I've gotten to the point where I'd rather read the back of my shampoo bottle or peruse my way through a stack of disclaimer forms.  McCarthy is a master of the language, no doubt.  But in order to make us read the book he ought to at least make it interesting 
 I can't understand anyone giving this movie anything but one star. It stinks. It's a tired and overdone plot with a main character who is very hard to care about. I wanted more of the stray dog story. At least that would have given us more to watch. Even Judd's roommate made a more interesting study. The Lucy/Judd character is just plain boring. She drinks. We get it. Coors light. We get it. Please buy it. She poses and plays pool and gets drunk every night. We get it. She drives too fast and she wears the same clothes every day. We get it. She sleeps around with strangers. We get it. She NEVER combs her freakin' hair. We DON'T get it. She is a most unhappy and unlikeable girl. We got it. I won't get the movie, however. I am actually glad I had a free rental here.   Save your dimes and rent Kiss the Girls. At least that was interesting and you cared about Judd's character. And she combed her hair at least once. Sig 
 While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as "special" or "crippled," I would never recommend it, because of the title,  which is bad as "The Nig**er Lamb" would be. Get it?  I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called "crippled" and terms like "special" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause  children to be perceived even more as "special" instead of different but equal 
 Author is a Financial planner and recommends no self management of your own money.  Contains little original material most charts and tables are from the author's employer, Amex.  You will notice that each previous reviewer has only written a review on THIS book, and most reviewers are located near the authors home town in Michigan  What are the odds?  There is no over all plan in this book to manage your money, much less an original thought. Logic is heavily tilted towards using a planner and often nonsense. As an example on page 2 the author exhorts the value of Certified Financial Planner (CFP) with taken classes and exams, but on page 5 the reader will learn that a CFP takes a 2 day class and one test.  There are no impressive reviews or any review on the book cover except from the authors employer, Amex.  This book does not contain unbiased information.  Update:  The author is a part time professor at a local univeristy which 'encourages' publication  as a prof he might be great but as an author much room for improvement...  
 Lights Out 1 and 2 were dark tribal masterpieces.  3 is way too electronic, with only one standout song near the beginning of disc 1.  When he played at Avalon in Hollywood during his Lights Out 3 tour, he was amazing.  I don't understand why this CD didn't have great songs on it.  Mix CD's, especially those not recorded live at a club, should be a compilation of the some of the dj's best songs.    My 3rd disc seems to be defective, as only 3 tracks play.  Anyone else have this problem 
 Being bored and offended at the same time is hard to manage - but this film manages.  It is lacking in story lines and acting and I would advise anyone not to waste money buying it.  If you want to wait and rent it, then you will have invested less.  Just make sure to get another film to watch after you get bored and quit with this one. 
 You really wont learn much about leadership from this expensive tome.  Its just a compilation of short sketches about people who are known for leadership.  Nothing in depth at all.  I regret having spent the money on this book.  I should have looked it over more closely before buying it 
 It is hard to imagine what the American songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this, not once, not twice, but three times.  Stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it is staggeringly ill conceived.  The problem, of course, is his voice.  The selection of material seems ideally suited to showcase his limitations as a singer, which are countless.  For starters, he has almost no range at all.  Next, his raspiness has no inherent beauty, and these are songs intended for beautiful voices.  By their very nature, the selections are vehicles for skilled singers, their simplicity allows excellent performers to interpret and express individual perspective.  Stewart, because he is a rock and blues singer, never learned the fundamentals of singing and certainly never developed a mature, expressive voice.  He scratches along the surface of these listless vehicles with the charm of a man skating over ice with sandpaper strapped to his shoes.  Banks of strings and fabulously misguided collaborations, (Dolly Parton!), do not mask but highlight what is wrong with this project.  Bear in mind that I like Rod Stewart; he's from Scotland and he's the prototypical Brit blues belter.  If you want to know what he's actually good at, dig out your copy of Jeff Beck's first release, Truth.  Stewart delivers some of the best blue-eyed twelve bar wailing ever recorded.  But that's the problem.  On Truth it was the cigarettes, whisky, and swagger in his voice that made him great - it wasn't about singing technique - it was about authenticity.  Here, the focus is on singing, and his limitations are embarrassingly spotlighted.  Albums like this never get made unless the performer already has name recognition that guarantees sales, nightmares of this stripe could never stand on their own merits.  To be avoided at all cost.  
 It has tons of information; both fresh and processed foods, but I found it difficult to look at the pages.  The cheap, greyish, mass market paperback pages are fine for a novel and straight through reading, but when you're trying to follow a tiny chart it makes it hard to do.  After looking at all the food counting books in the bookstore, I finally found one compact book with medium stock, bright paper and great info that was easy on the eyes for just $2 more.  The Ultimate Calorie, Carb, & Fat Gram Counter by Lea Ann Holzmeister.  I recommend that one over the Netzer book 
 The movie wasn't even close to anything from the Arthurian legends, the plot was weak. The acting was good but it goes to show you that even superb actors can't overcome a fatally weak, cliche-driven script. What a waste of an opportunity to make a great movie.  The cliches begin with Malagant (Ben Cross) - a character manufactured by Hollywood who combines all that is evil, "wears black", slaughters the innocent for sport, etc.    Lancelot (Richard Gere) - an unbelievable man-of-the-1990's character foils the evil Malagant, marries Guinevere (Julia Ormond), now Arthur's (Sean Connory) widow and they live happily ever after.  If this appeals to you, RENT the movie. I can't imagine you'd ever want to buy it for your personal library unless you are teaching the History of Bad Movies.  Hey Amazon, you need a "half a star" rating for situations just such as this.    
 Others who have said that piece is poor and boring are correct. Reich, just like Philip Glass, has lost his original style that we all loved to hear in the first place. He has replaced his original style with something that must be an attempt to make his music more palpable to a commercial audience. Unfortunately, this "new Reich" is very bovine and greatly insipid. I can only hope Reich returns to his true roots =and makes something for his real fans instead of pandering to yuppies. 
 James is a great literary virtuoso, in certain ways the most sophisticated and complex America has had. His intricate intelligence is complemented by an unequaled descriptive power, and a mastery of language, second to none. How difficult then to come across the passage which ruins this book for me. This is James description of the immigrant Jews on the East Side.It is the observation of the sterile aristrocatic owner of Anglo-Saxon civilization who looks with contempt and horror at the poor swarming sweatshop crowd threatening to steal his private inheritance from him.  
 In general, I don't think much of the manufacture of the scrubs that are sold for medical professionals.  I thought Dickies would be the best, but found they are mostly like the others.  After I received these, I ordered Dove Apparel, which are more expensive but thicker of material and sturdier of make 
 Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us. 
 There's a ton of paper in this book, overboard, in my opinion. Wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious.  I've taken quite a few of the Sierra hikes and the information hasn't been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail. They miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation. I think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in California 
 These steaks dribble like a basketball and shoot like a dream. They should include a backboard, rim, and net with these. And some cheerleaders wouldn't hurt, either 
 The plot was very good, but I could not tell who was talking and who was being talked to during most of the book.  As an avid reader, I was looking forward to reading an easy-to-read, entertaining book before getting back to something heavier.  Boy was I wrong - I am not accustomed to so much dialogue confusion.  The book was poorly written and I do not recommend it to anyone. 
 The movie was simply boring. Do not buy this DVD. The storytelling was slow. There were a couple of shots that could have been edited out. Within the first 10 - 15 minutes there were shots that did nothing to add, develop or enhance the story line. Boring. The costume, cinematography, fight choreography, etc., all lackluster and subpar. I'm not necessarily asking for a big budget martial arts epic, but this was not good. The english dubbed is amusingly bad. I do think part of the soundtrack was dropped. I also have a problem with the voice talent that they used for this film. Maybe I'm used to the voice talents from older martial arts films like Five Deadly Venoms. Oh, I did fall asleep while watching this film 
 To all commentators who are trying to justify the biasness of this book, you should be ashamed. This book has a MAJOR tilt to the left in terms of how it looks at not only economics, but history. The Reagan bashing is childish and arrogant and the anti-capitalist economic theories are very one-sided, yet disguised as intelligent because it is thorough and detailed. The economic growth of the 80's and 90's and the higher standards of living and worker gains in those era's hopefully will, or should have made this book completely irrelevant.  
 I agree with other reviewers that this is a survey or concept book.  Schlossnagle is a bright php programmer but a lousy teacher.  Do not buy this book if you are hoping to learn 'Advanced PHP Programming' from it.  This book is too superficial in it's coverage of the many subjects.  Ie: Schlossnagle's coverage of Object Oriented Programming is less than six pages (why bother?), and does not adequately cover the basics.  This book is good for introducing you to things you may not have thought of before.  Ie: I liked the section on exceptions but found it too brief and assumed too much.  I was therefore forced to read other materials, including the official php manual, before I had a real grasp of exceptions.  Larry Ullman does a much better job of explaining subjects.  His PHP Advanced for the www (first edition) is an excellent book to actually learn from.  Unfortunately it is a little dated and the second edition is still a couple months away.  Do yourself a favor, spend your money on another book if you are intending to actually learn 'Advanced PHP Programming' from a book 
 Do some people lose weight on this diet?  Sure.  Some people lost weight on the cabbage soup diet, others on the Adkins diet - but none of these are based on sound nutritional science.  Because of this, I would not recommend this book to anyone.  There are a lot of junk science diet books on the market.    If you are not only interested in losing weight, but are actually interested in becoming healthy, preventing or eliminating heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and so many other western diseases . . . then I would recommend Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, MD - an extremely well researched and documented book on how to lose weight by eating a nutritionally dense, healthy diet.  And it is surprisingly easy to do.  You will not only lose pounds, but a lot of Rx meds!  Another book that I highly recommend is the China Study, by T. Colin Campbell, MD - this book documents the larges nutritional study ever done.  A very readable book written by a top scientist - he shows you the science behind Dr. Fuhrman's work, and reinforces Dr. Fuhrman's claims about what it means to eat a truly healthy diet that will lead you to achieve and maintain your optimal weight. 
 This is easily the WORST casebook I have ever owned. LOUSY for learning future interest and possessory estates. LOUSY for learning mortgages. LOUSY for learning adverse possession. Mainly lousy, lousy, lousy. Don't buy this book without purchasing a hell of a study aid b/c you won't learn jack from it since it's horribly written. Don't buy this book w/out purchasing a hell of a good pair of reading glasses b/c the print is practically microscopic. I can't believe I have to suffer through another property course w/this terrible book 
 Irving has lost his mind! This was sad to read as it just dragged on forever with no reward in sight. The taboo subjects were a little creepy but its main problem was that he wasted these developed characters on a dull, repetitive story. I think he is (was?) one of the greatest American writers alive. He must have a comeback novel next time out. If not, I think someone should check in on him 
 If imitation is the highest form of praise, then this book must be one of the most praised books in the English canon.  A man from a middle-class upbringing leaves it and ends up stuck on a tropical island.  This story would inspire Swiss Family Robinson, Castaway, and probably Lord of the Flies.  Mr. Crusoe is a white, Englishman with a wife and kids.  After the wife dies, he leaves the kids to go on his own and to serve God.  He ends up stuck on an island by himself.  There he encounters cannibalistic natives, and one of their intended victims.  The former scares him, and he essentially enslaves the latter, teaching him to call him Master.    The book is not that interesting, as tales of desperation and survival are actually quite common 
 In fact not good at all..  I really don't like Good Charlotte.. And I don't own this CD, my brother does.  Almost all the songs are about the singer feeling sorry for himself, whining about how miserable he is. And the lyrics are very, very simple.  "Hold on" is supposed to be a song against suicide, but I find it totally unbelievable, when theres a song on the CD Called "the day that I die", where he sings that the happiest of his life is the that he dies. And I think he mentions death in some other songs too. So maybe he is not that miserable, or "hold on" is just an attempt to gain more popularity and being heroic. It really makes no sense.  I'm giving this CD 1 star because I really think it's bad. Not because I think "real punk" and "classic rock" is the only good music, and you should buy that instead (that's just stupid). There are lot's of great alternatives to this cd. But there are also a lot of bands in this genre, that are almost as bad as Good Charlotte.  Comparing this to Blink 182 is insane. Blink 182 makes great melodies and clever lyrics 
 90% of all the exercises are strictly yoga poses.  I am throughly disgusted that I spent my good money on a BIG RIP OFF!  2/3 of the book is spent with Mr. Weisberg loving the view of his own words in print.    Take my advice and go to the library and rent either books or videos of yoga for FREE.  Mr. Weisberg cleverly renames all of the poses but I can guarantee you they are Yoga poses as I took yoga instructions for 3 months and attend weekly classes on a continuing basis.  I showed his book to my Yoga teacher and he was thoroughly disgusted that this supposedly professional person would do such an unprofessional act all for the sake of book sales 
 At first glance, this book looked exciting. However, once I started to (try to) read it, I found this book, itself, to be poorly designed. Emphasis seemed to be on slick, glossy pages rather than on content--unfortunate, because my initial appraisal had been, "Great! Full color examples". Sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations. There are better books out there. Over all, worth a glance but not a purchase unless you are just building a group library of information graphics books. I also agree with another reviewer who felt that some of the example designs were not very good 
 I found that tying in human traits to different styles of architecture was not interesting at all. There is no discussion of building techniques or the practical side of architecture.  This would be more for the artist that is trying to project different human feelings into the structure.  If you are looking for a techincal guide to architecture this is not it 
 This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system.  This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times.  I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe.  But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends.  This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting.  The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much.  The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times.  As a result, the book became a little boring.  I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across.  About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review.  The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers.    Secondly, I did not like the book.  Plain and simple.  That is OK.  Not every book jives with everybody.  I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring.  I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus.  You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you.  I am free to express my opinions on these books.  And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life.  You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me.  So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers.  I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it.  I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other 
 Yes it's alternate all right- as in the authors ARE NOT historians and just make it up as they go along.  I read through the previous reviews and only counted 5 (?) negatives which only proves that the detractors did not feel compelled to expend effort on a story they didn't like or the positive writers were smoking some good stuff and didn't really remember too much of what they read.  I read each of the NEGS to be sure I didn't rehash prior arguments.  Straight off I was discouraged by the complete lack of knowledge and/or research in their project.  On page 33 there is a description of the "Nineteenth AD" division insignia; "a white star on a badge of crimson".  HOLY COW Batman, US armored divions, then as now, all use a triangular patch of red, blue and yellow with their numeric designation centered in the bottom half.  Question to the authors... what the (heck) is a Schmeisser?  It is not a German SMG as the authors in child-like enthusiam repeatedly misuse the term.  You might say, "bah these are small things" but they are indemic of a poorly crafted work.  I am struggling mightily to finish this horrid tale as I am stubborn and refuse to let a book "beat me" but I have already binned my mass-back copy of the follow-on Fox on the Front UNREAD.  Fool me once, shame on you-fool me twice shame on me!  
 To begin with this book has the worse index ever. The book is lacking helpful information and filled with information that holds no value. The book is nothing more than a feeble attempt at providing a BCP template, of which you can find better and simpler on the Internet for free 
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 As a new bride, I thought this book was --well--let's say---BORING!. No style..no design and these authors are "lost" as far as what brides want in the 21st century. If you are young, hip and cool, this book is not for you. If you are old on a 4th marriage, you might like it. Also-warning ..these authors have TERRIBLE reviews on their Baby Bargains book. It seems they write all their own great reviews. I think Martha Stewart weddings is OBVIOUSLY much better and I also think I would not recommend a book from Denise and Alan Field's EVER 
 This is a Grilling Cookbook. Not a book about grilling for dummies. I had never grilled before and this book goes off about sauces and marinades, when I just wanted to start by putting a slab of meat or a hot dog on the grill. Needless to say, I was lost and confused before I got the gas connected (which it doesn't help you with, either BTW).  It was totally useless for me 
 I read a lot, and this is one of the worst books I've read recently and certainly the worst "historical novel" ever.  It is neither historical nor deserving of the title novel.  It is comparable to a romance novel, however, the reader never gets invested in the characters and the sexual tension is non-existent.  Don't bother with this one 
 I suppose, it all depends on what you come to expect from a dvd. I was absolutely blown away by Celtic Woman produced by David Downes and also Riverdance, 10th year anniversary. This dvd isn't all bad though, it DID have a rather annoying 'ancient' tv screen blotting out the beautiful scenery of ireland. I'm really not quite sure what the intent was, aside from telling you something of the musicians. For me, it was a big let down. 
 As Hamlet is Bloom's god one would have expected a more generous bible. Instead this is one of Bloom's most disappointing books, filled with the hot -air of exaggerated praise unjustified by  argument or evidence. This is Harold Bloom at his most -declarative placing Hamlet above and beyond all literary- and one would dare to say- human characters.  It is also quite a paltry text, padded with quotation. And it assumes a critical knowledge of Hamlet which I venture to say only few of even its most devoted readers and spectators possess. As there is a whole critical literature built on the subject of Hamlet's delay in executing his father's request for vengeance I thought that Bloom would in some meaningful way address this. The Hamlet of passion, of passion for Ophelia also, of passionate involvement with the deepest questions of meaning in life is somehow absent here. Instead we have a more detached playing and playful Hamlet, cruel to the point of testing our sympathy. In short 'the Hamlet' Bloom reads and worships is far from the Hamlet of most Tradition. And is far from the Hamlet whose tormented existential questionings have so enthralled so many readers through the generations. Instead of augmenting the name of Hamlet ,Bloom has perhaps made a minor wound in it- though of course Bloom is right in knowing that this character is too 'immortal' to really be wounded by any single critic, however important or great 
 while the subject matter of the book was interesting -and there are plenty enough reviews here without me adding to/detracting from that- my comment is a fundamental problem with the publishing/printing of the book: there are numbered notes of sources of the various claims made at the back of the book, but the text in the chapters of the book HAS NO REFERENCE NUMBERS. so, basically, you have no way of validating the claims unless you dig around the notes at the end of the book hoping to cross-reference the parts you're currently reading. every other non-fiction book i've read numbers their notes; why doesn't this book? steven d. levitt would ask to think about this, and maybe, just maybe, it's because some of his claims are tenuous at best. or maybe i just got a badly printed/published book. for the record, it was the hardback edition, published 2005 
 "Blind Alley" is the fifth novel in the continuing story of Eve Duncan, forensic sculptor, Joe Quinn, Atlanta police detective and Jane MacGuire, their precocious seventeen year old adopted daughter rescued from the streets. Be warned that much of this review might be construed as spoilers but I'm betting that it's not going to matter much since you'll likely be giving the book a pass anyway!   I used to treat Iris Johansen as a sure thing! You know what I mean - the kind of author whose new title you'd add to your reading list without even caring what the plot line was or you'd pick up a copy at the store without even bothering to flip open the dust jacket for a peek! "Blind Alley" buried that thought - cold, deep and fast! It was a great deal more than just bad - it was truly painful!   A shadowy serial killer named Aldo is on the loose slaughtering women in a most unseemly, gruesome fashion. Carving their living faces right off their skulls, Aldo imagines himself responsible for the systematic elimination of all women who resemble Cira, a courtesan/actress/prostitute killed two thousand years ago in the town of Herculaneum when Vesuvius erupted. It would seem that Aldo is a little upset at having lost the love and attention of his father, an archeologist who became obsessed with Cira when he discovered her statue and some details of her life.   As if that isn't deep enough in left field as the premise for a thriller, imagine the eyebrows you'll raise when you read that Jane MacGuire, Eve Duncan and Joe Quinn's adopted 17 year old daughter is a ringer for Cira. Not only does she find herself stalked by Aldo but some inexplicable psychological attachment to Cira plagues Jane with regular nightmares in which she is trapped in caves or tunnels fleeing for her life from the eruption of Vesuvius.   It doesn't end there - Johansen tosses Mark Trevor into the mix. He's a con and an antiquities smuggler (picture Lovejoy with a nasty streak!) who had a run-in with Aldo and is intent on killing him. To that end he intrudes himself into Eve Duncan's and Joe Quinn's life and sets himself up as Jane's protector. Now, I'm no prude but the scene in which Trevor, a grown man at least as old as Joe, has a near sexual encounter with Jane, a typical seventeen year old teenager with respect to her hormones and sexuality, is just plain distasteful and, frankly, scored well into the red zone on the "yuk" meter!   There is just so much wrong with this novel, it's difficult to know where to begin and where to stop - nightmares that start, happen and end with no explanation or psychological development at all; unlike any previous Johansen novel I've read, the characters and dialogue seem trite, wooden and completely contrived; the outcome of Mark Trevor as a character is left spectacularly un-resolved; Eve Duncan's obsession with her murdered daughter, Bonnie, continues unabated and is definitely becoming downright irritating; a wonderful sub-plot concerning Eve's forensic reconstruction of a real skull from the Vesuvius eruption was simply deep-sixed!   I still own a few Johansen titles that I haven't read so there is perhaps hope. But she'll have to prove to me that she hasn't jumped the shark before I'll spend another cent on a new title!   Paul Weiss 
 I am astonished that this book might be the support material of a Harvard course... First of all, there is a massive mistake on the backcover of the book "Jean-Francois Le Pen" is in fact "Jean-Marie Le Pen". It is such an obvious mistake - it looks like a joke ! But OK, let's admit it's only a translation mistake, it doesn't change the overall quality of the book.  Just to let you know, the author is part of the left side of the french left wing - She is a typical example of the generation of "soixante-huitard" french intellectuals, who use to support the maoism if not the stalinism. 
 This is the best diet product ever!  I tried them all and "SKINNY WATER?" is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever.  The product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much.  I drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away.  I lost 15 lbs. in 20 days.  Great taste, it works great, and it's so inexpensive.  Great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight.  The owners should hire me to do commercials for them 
 Except for two cuties: William Zabka and Dana Ashbrook! Especially Dana who constantly having a hard-on 
 Kepler is a well written historical novel written during a time when Banville was attempting to write what he considered 'European novels of ideas'. In writing about the mind of a great scientist, has found a way to write about creativity without going down the established, oft cliched route of writing about writing, or painting. However it is fundamentally a poor book, which Banville has subsequently admitted. It artfully chronicles the ideas of Kepler, his struggle, but fails to invoke this in a passionate or beautiful manner.   Banville's best novels are works of art. As Beckett said of Joyce, his work is not about anything, it is about the work itself. Kepler is a novel about something, a novel of ideas. It does not work well. 
 Song writing - 5 stars all the way Roger never a doubt. Here is the thing and it's just one mans opinion. You don't have a strong enough voice to sing lead vocals. Your strength in harmony is undeniable, your strength in song writing is undeniable, your skill as a musician is second to none. You just don't have what is needed to fill the role of lead vocalist. That is the only thing that will keep this release from the ears of all who unfortunately will never get to appreciate it 
 Someone, please help me!!  I have tried all the online help videos and guides and such, and I still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again! PLEASE HELP 
 i finally decided to purchase this movie considering i was told by one person it was symbolic and by another it was truely disgusting.  however i found it to be very slow and boring which made want to go to sleep, making it difficult for me to actually catch any of this great symbolism i heard about.  as far as the digusting goes....i didn't find it that disgusting compared to some movies i have seen.  it isn't very explicit in the violence so there is not any gore to it and they aren't very innovative with the torture compared to some movies i have seen. the movie consists of alot of monotonous sodomy and an old lady telling stories of her sexual exploits while her friend plays the piano (these parts were rather torturous to sit through because they were the most boring in the film and she told quite a few stories).  if you want to see something shocking i would not look here and if you are looking for symbolism i wouldn't look here because it is difficult to stay awake unless you like watching a bunch of naked people walking around groping one another 
 Lets see, was it the part where the "ignored" were invisible when they would start fights?  Or maybe the part where the police didn't notice them when they broke into stores?  Wait, I think it was where they raped women for casual fun and no one noticed that I finally gave up on this rotten little book, and Bentley Little.  This is one of those "anti-books" for a younger generation than me.  I enjoy Maxx Barry (which is why I think this lousy book was recommended to me) but simply couldn't find a redeeming thing in this book.  Maxx Barry is light-hearted and CLEVER.  The Ignored is dull, mean-spirited and pointless.  I allow a great deal of room for creativity in writing and art, but sometimes you step back and say, "that isn't art."  This isn't a good book.  
   I am shocked by the hollowness of this effort. Here is a man who has been in the heart of the capital for eons, yet has observed nothing more than the expected comings and goings of the Washington elite? Woodward offers virtually no illuminated perspective on what is perhaps a seminal, pivotal shift in this nation's genetic destiny. We are at a crossroad. A potential soceital divide. Yet we're supposed to take away that "Bush is a pretty okay guy, who manages on the fly?" Please Mr. Woodward. People are dying in the first "unprovoked offensive war" in the history of this great country. "President" is not an "entry level" position, sir. And with all due respect to you being a responsible journalist and author - neither is yours 
 I was extremely disappointed in this item. I think it is a good concept, but it doesn't work well at all.  it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it.  I tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that I drank anything.  it is awkward to drink from too.  I can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market.  not worth buying.  just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation 
 I loved "Tailchaser's Song" by Tad Williams (although I did read it as a teen) and I like cats, so I thought I'd try this cat-character fantasy novel.  I really did not like it.  I read it to the end because I kept thinking "maybe it will get better and it will all have been worth it".  But no.  The main cat character was very juvenile and annoying.  He is a young cat, so maybe his characteristics were "realistic", but it was still annoying.  The whole "wild roads" concept was extremely strange and just not "believable" fantasy.  A fantasy world needs to be built up in such a way that the reader is drawn in and finds the world believable and compelling.  This was not the case for me.  I scanned a few of the reviews and several people seemed to really like the book, so maybe it is a "loved it" or "hated it" book.  I am still searching for a quality "Tailchaser's Song" or "Watership Down" type book.  I would not recommend this book 
 this little white janet jackson wannabe is a total sellout and trailer trash with nasly moans for a voice and stiff dancing. And yet 70 million losers bought her records 
 Who wrote this book?  Surely not Ms. Braun. I checked out the audiobook from the library and am delighted I didn't pay good money for it. I am sorry I spent an evening listening to it though; a complete waste of time. The book has no character development, the plot (such as it is) is completely unresolved; and, finally the book just ends!  I actually backed up the playback to be sure I hadn't missed something.    This book is a tragic end (I hope) to what was a wonderful series. Whoever edited this disappointing effort should be fired.  
 This book would make a good school book to show kids the basics of electrical circuits.  It unfortunately is based on obsolete technology for the hydronic controls and has no controls for heat pumps. It's based around boilers etc. 
 Not the best book in my library.  I'd take a pass on this and buy an extra roll of toilet paper.  It is softer 
 My Coolpix 8800 lapsed into "system error 2" mode within weeks of getting it.   After taking 3 or 4 shots the error message comes up and I have to shut it down and start it back up to take a few more shots before the error 2 message recurrs.  Nikon says to try a fresh battery and different storage card...no help.   Now Nikon says says send it in and we'll fix it- but don't say what it will cost...   The shots I do get aren't as good as an HP camera we have that was half the price.  The controls are ridiculously complex.   The flash pops up and fires when shooting in bright light...the whole thing is a piece of junk.  The only good shots I've gotten with it are inside shooting documents from 2 feet away...but for any outdoor complicated lighting it is unreliable... I wouldn't recommend this camera or any Nikon product to my worst enemy....Oh yeah, and they made the lens an oddball size so you have to buy overpriced Nikon filters for it.... 
 There are a lot of really bad books on portrait painting, and this is definitely one of them.  If Amazon was giving this book away, I would not want one.  There is really no instruction to speak of in this book.  The style is also pretty boring, and lifeless.  The type of uninspired, realism, and bad painting so typical of American Artist magazine.   Instead buy any of the Charles Reid books, but his Natural way to paint is the best for portrait painting.   ...Okay, maybe I have been a little harsh.  If you took this book, and stacked it up with some other bad art books, you could angle your watercolor board, and paint in the style of Charles Reid.  So, I guess it isn't worthless, just not very good 
 The work of a 12 year-old without talent. Phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy, inappropriate similies. Story line is absurd. If this were Koontz's first novel, no publisher would touch it 
 I like Vonnegut enough to have a desire to see this movie, after all the book was pretty good and one of my favorites by Vonnegut.  This movie flat out stinks.  Vonnegut's books just don't translate over to the Big Screen very well and this movie is no exception.  I suggest you read the book, but pass on the movie - in fact avoid it all cost 
 I'm hoping that most of the people who wrote these reviews didn't actually stoop so low as to buy the book.  I read a few pages of it, and this is truly 7th-8th grade level writing.  I didn't realize that Bill's narcissism extended to the point at which he actually thought his writing was INTERESTING, rather than just blatantly one-sided and sickeningly arrogant.  Bill should stick to repetitive, "I know better," conservative babble - it gives us liberals/radicals/freethinkers something to make fun of 
 I found this book to be very confusing. It is organized alphabetically... which makes no sense. There is no way to know what you need to know until you know what you need to know. It should be called the Bird book encyclopedia. A much much better book is the Audobon Backyard Birdwatcher. This book is not very colorful or engaging. I returned it. 
 I was so disappointed in the fact that the guitar didn't come with any picks or a strap- I didn't realize it when ordering, or I would have ordered that, too.  My son had trouble holding it without the strap... when I finally got around to buying those items, I showed the guitar to my brother, who has been playing for 30 years, and he said it didn't stay tuned.  once you play a chord, it goes out of tune.  I'm not thrilled, to say the least 
 "Hellhounds on my Trail" is a disappointment. The legendary Robert Johnson, perhaps the greatest blues musician in the history of this country, is unseen and effectively unheard in this collage of generally mediocre performances by admirers and wannabes. In fact, the two weakest performances in the film are the opening and closing sequences. The only insight which comes through clearly here is the vast gulf in talent between Robert Johnson and his imitators 
 While I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, the second was pure agony. I actually started to skim through most of the pages until I reached the end.  It is dense with detail; almost too dense. For instance, Finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire. His descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages, but by page 10 of the fire, I was completely and totally bored. Now, I'm not saying fiction should always be a "quick, easy read". Quite the contrary. I found Finney's writing to be refreshing. But c'mon folks, this book should have been 100-150 pages shorter. (Strictly for over-the-top romance lovers). 
 Peter Lorre's ,"The Black Cat",is charmingly done.Yet,the other two are stinkers.I'm a Corman fan,but this was boring and silly to watch.I think they had a good idea ,bringing the trilogy it to the big screen.But,this version and interpretation of Poe's masterpieces didn't translate well at all.So ,beware of the dog 
 As is obvious from his title, Mr. Helminiak believes that he is able to provide special insight regarding Biblical teaching on homosexuality.  But he makes clear from the beginning that he does not really care what the Bible says: "As a Roman Catholic - and more importantly, a thinking person - I do not presume the Bible has the last word on sexual ethics" (19).  He approaches the Biblical text as though it had no Divine origin whatsoever.  He relegates God's description of homosexuality as "abomination" (Lev. 18:22; 20:13; cf. Prov. 6:16) to the Israelites' personal qualms about such activity: "The early Israelites considered it unclean. They thought it was dirty. They prohibited it not because it was wrong in itself but because it offended their religious worldview" (63).  Of course, God had no problems with offending the Israelites' religious worldview (cf. Ex. 32).  Helminiak will deny authorship of a passage if it conflicts with his prejudice.  In asserting that the sin of Sodom was actually "inhospitality," he cites a few passages (including the non-canonical Book of Wisdom) and concludes "The Bible often uses Sodom as an example of the worst sinfulness, but the concern is NEVER simply sexual acts" (49).  But in this section, Helminiak fails even to consider Jude 7, which establishes beyond a shadow of a doubt that the sin and punishment of Sodom concerned sexual sins.  Obviously, I cannot endorse a book that violates Biblical teaching.  But for one looking to justify what the Bible clearly condemns, perhaps a better effort is made elsewhere 
 I'm a huge Yankee fan so I enjoyed the opportunity to remember the events of their first championship season in nearly two decades, but Sherman desperately needs an editor. The book completely lacks structure, with tangent building on tangent to form an incoherent mess. There are diamonds in the rough in the form of interesting revelations, but getting to them can be hard work indeed. 
 ... Tyrese Gibson, for WORST ACTOR EVER.  Up to this point, I've been a huge Paul Walker fan for his comedically bad acting.  He's made a career of it.  In this one, his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word "bro" at least 75 times (to give his character street cred), and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops - it's clear Walker is deeply considering his plight.  But really Walker can't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of Tyrese Gibson.  My god where did they find this guy?  The movie would've been OK as a standard, mindless action film, but it really was ruined by the 6th grade drama club acting.  Now you might be wonderning: who's the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie?  But wait, there's actually method to this madness.  Since their was no Vin Diesel, the director knew he had only Paul Walker left.  And it's well known that Walker cannot carry a film (see "Timeline").  So what to do?  Of course!  Find an actor EVEN WORSE than Walker and cast them together!  All of the sudden Walker doesn't look so terrible, because everyone's focusing on this other chump.  And apparently it worked, because a lot of people enjoyed this film, and there's even a sequel.  
 I bought this book expecting an adventure.  I have heard of the rare person who remembers in full detail previous lives and existences.  So I was expecting a great book.  I was disapointed.  From the beginning nothing seemed to ring true.  I kept waiting for the book to come alive, but it never did.  The book just kept dredging along.  Everything seemed flacid and boring.  Descriptions seemed usurped from modern day knowledge.  The mysteries revealed were weakly described.  The rare description of the afterlife and the laws of karma were wrong.  While some preliminary research was probably done into the subject matter, in my opinion this book is nothing more than a stale attempt at fiction.  It's information rather than intuited was invented 
 I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie. The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did. At least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be 
 In brief: The negative reviewers of this book are right.  Rand had problems.  Early Objectivism was cult-like (and that is  carried forward still in the ARI/Peikoff branch of Objectivism).  But this book goes far beyond legitimate reporting on those topics, becoming fairly contemptible.  Page after page is marred by excessive (or utterly gratuitous) cheap shots and rambling.  There is a pages-long disquisition on the nature of monetary policy which is without relevance or even coherence, except to try to paint Alan Greenspan in the most negative light possible.  Even in the expected dirt-dishing sections, Walker frequently makes criticisms that either aren't founded, or that actually contradict another criticism he stated but a paragraph earlier.  (Only one tiny example among thousands: in the chapter on Nathaniel Branden, first Branden is bad because his early self-esteem theory didn't stress self-acceptance; then in the next paragraph, Branden is bad because he later modified or corrected his self-esteem theory, to stress self-acceptance).  In terms of biographical details about Rand and associates, the book supplies little that is new (i.e., that was not already in the 2 Branden biographies/memoirs, plus The Journals of Ayn Rand).  The book only begins to redeem itself in the last chapter or two.  Walker gives an interesting survey of old novels and movies that anticipated Rand's _Atlas Shrugged_.  The chapter only starts to work when Walker, in his own words, decides that "Whether Rand concealed any of these influences...I will not pursue" (in other words, to stick to reportage and not personal attacks).  If only he had done the same in the rest of the book!  But even this much-improved chapter is still marred by some strange non sequiturs and sudden ad hominems.  It could have been a good book; Walker obviously did a lot of research.  But he became consumed by his own hatred...not to mention his apparently resentful desire to promote certain non-Randians.  (For example, Walker insistently quotes Albert Ellis and Murray Rothbard at their worst, i.e., them at their most personally resentful. 
 There is actually a lot of interesting historical information for the right-of-center reader who wants to learn about the right-wing/Republican successes in bolstering its face time in the American media.   But it's a tough read because Brock is obviously extremely skeptical of pretty much everything that comes out of the mouth of anyone who votes Republican.   Brock hurts his credibility early on when he states flat out that his early conservative writings were actually literary regurgitations of the right wing party line. But what's to keep a reader from viewing this book as just a left-wing version of the same?  I think he could have balanced the book by discussing more specific left-of-center successes. Whenever he does mention the left-wing in the media, it's usually in lofty platitudes about their objectivity and non-partisanship (trust me, Brock really believes this).   He seems to think the left-wing is totally helpless in the face of the right-wing media juggernaut. Does anyone in America actually believe that?  This book has the potential to be an informative read (it's over 400 pages), but it too often lapses into name calling, unsubstantiated generalizations, and conspiratorial excess.   Leave the wild rhetoric to Michael Moore and just give us the facts 
 I purchased this book for classes at the community college in Arizona. Upon receiving the book, Amazon did not attach the CD-ROM that was suppose to go with it. Amazon still could not correct the order after the second try by sending me the CD-ROM that is stated in the editorial reviews. I had to return both books at there cost. Two weeks later, I am now looking for the book from another supplier. Amazon just couldn't fill the order correctly 
 The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.  The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.  The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.  I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.  The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title "hero," would you still rate it highly?  If your answer is "yes," then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.  Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.  Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.   I'm not counting on that, though 
 Eggers and Smith, the two "hippest" writers around, assume that they have the gravitas to force their trendy, ironic tastes on the reading public.  If their own books are any indication, this volume will be chalk-full of pompous post-modern dronings about the absurdity of contemporary existence.  Eggers forward is atrocius.  So you should skip that.  Actually, skip the whole book.  But if you're one of those young people wearing vintage track jackets, cardigan sweaters, stonewashed jeans, black-rimmed granny classes and multiple facial piercings, and who loves discussing the nuances of Foucalt's philosophy at Starbucks, then look no further. This collection was made for you 
 This book is an insult to one's intelligence, a shameless hagiography of J.R. Oppenheimer and the "de rigueur" mud-slinging at Edward Teller. How low can a Harvard historian stoop?  The facts: J. R. Oppenheimer was a fortunate choice as the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab director during the second world war: he had "charisma" to attract first class talent to work on the atomic bomb. As a scientist, he never did "Nobel" class genius work, nor did he invent the atomic bomb (the "honor" goes to Leo Szilard and O. Frisch and R. Peierls).  After the "Trinity" test and vaporizing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the accompanying glory and political clout made it difficult for any vain personality such as Oppenheimer to accept somebody's better idea, Edward Teller's "Super", without sour grapes. Oppenheimer's position as the head of the General Advisory Committee of the AEC provided the vehicle for the sour grapes in a form of sophisticated "feet dragging" on the effort on the Hydrogen bomb.  Contrary to hagiographers such as Ms. McMillan, Oppenheimer's qualms about the destructivness of nuclear weapons is a bit hypocritical: Hiroshima and Nagaski were chosen by a target committee that included Oppenheimer, and no qualms were expressed during the seminal 1951 Princeton meeting on radiation implosion, on the contrary, it was mesmerizingly "technically sweet".  As far as Edward Teller, he was involved in the US nuclear weapons effort from the beginning, from driving Szilard to Einstein's house to write the famous letter to Roosevelt in 1939, to his discovery of the usefulness of implosion to decrease the amount of Plutonium for a supercritical mass through compression, the invention of the "Super" Hydrogen bomb, the booster, the "Alarm Clock/Sloika", the use of solid LiD instead of liquid D & T, the "radiation implosion", the "equilibrium super", and other numerous clever inventions that maintained the peace for 60 years...  Yes, it was unfortunate and unforgivable that Oppenheimer was dragged into a "sham" security risk hearing, but he courted the animosity of the government with his careless associations and biased pontification on all matters nuclear...Let's not forget that the Soviet Union had 50+ million killed during the communist reigns of terror and gulags...  In my oppinion, Richard Rhodes has a better and more readable account of the affair in the context of the Hydrogen bomb development, although he cannot hide his dislike and cheap shots at Edward Teller...but then Teller was not "risk-averse" or worried about "political correctness" as these writers.. 
 I wanted to enjoy "To Repel Ghosts" so much. I have seen many of Jean Michel basquiats paintings and drawings. He was as poetic visually as he was when writing his thoughts down. Kevin Youngs book suffers because he seems to want to live through Basquiats words...but that is all that they seem to be is words...without soul!!! 
 This book looks good only at first sight. However, try and solve the exercises and you see there is more to VaR than the author wants us to believe. This book is too incoherent to be of any use. Just take a look at the index: A lot of things are introduced but are never used again later in the book. This makes me wonder why they were introduced at all. Some examples from the index: Hessian, GARCH, Markov process, etc. The biggest fault however in my opinion is the treatment of Monte Carlo, the most essential tool for VaR calculation: Condensed in roughly 30 pages compared to roughly 110 pages for mathematical preliminaries and probability cannot cater to the same audience 
  Well.... I'm less than impressed.I expected a reader's journey through a year of books and instead got an unwanted journey through a random collection of personal anecdotes about the author's husband, child, mother, baseball, writer friends, etc.  The fact that she made some glaring mistakes in the book was also fairly annoying. Specifically, she says Emma Donoghue's first novel was Slammerkin.... it wasn't. On the same page she says that Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace was based on the same crime.... it wasn't. I almost stopped at that point but the one reedeeming feature of the book is that it's short. 
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 Beyond the glaring fact that most of their products aren't tomatoes, this one is a blight on the Just Tomatoes ethos.  "Just." But it has two ingredients. It's not "just" anything if it includes both bananas & strawberries. They don't call Cracker Jack "Just Peanuts, Popcorn, and High Fructose Corn Syrup."  Nor is it "just" something when it comes in a package of 2. They don't call a variety pack of cereal "Just Grains and High Fructose Corn Syrup."  The Just Tomatoes folks deserve credit for their aspirations to purity but this just goes beyond it. It goes against the mimalist and reductive concept to the absolutely roccoco. It's just not right 
 I bought this book after reading that it was supposed to be a good source of simple easy to prepare meals.... NOT! The ingredients are tough to find and the fancy recipes aren't at all close to "everyday cooking".  You'll have more chest pain trying this book than a whole case of deep-fried cheesesticks could ever cause 
 I have tried everything. Firewire, USB. There was an insert in the guide that mentioned that you have to connect the cable first to your PC then to your camera, then turn on the PC then turn on the camera...then wait for the stars to align in the right order. If you do anything in a different order then your camera can get damaged. What kind of a crazy world does Panasonic live in?  Well, I followed the instructions to the tee, downloded the right drivers and all and yet my PC does not recognize the GS19 or the GS9. I have used both. The GS19 is a new purchase so this is definitely going back. I thought, this model would have gone away with the kinks but, NO!  So, my panasonic recorded DVs are gonna remain on the tape. I will never be able to put them on DVDs. What a joke, this camera turned out to be 
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original.  My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered.  Don't order this product 
 I had very high expectations for this movie, especially given a great Director, Robecca Romijn, and Antonio Banderas.  Way wrong!  The movie has a bit of a european flair due to much of it being filmed in Paris - however - the movie plot is very difficult to follow, and takes too much effort to try and understand whats going on.  Please let me save you the money - select another movie 
 Well, if giving up your favourite things such as alcohol, coffee, elevators, taxis, newspapers, cell phone, shopping, dining out, television, cursing, chocolate and multitasking seems difficult for you, think again. Carlomagno has written just the book to entice you to try giving up some of your favourite things - at least one thing for a month. In a whole year she managed to give up all the above, each for a month. Lessons to be learnt: she grew wiser in terms of giving street directions because she had to rely on buses. She grew to like tea when she gave up coffee. In giving up elevators, she felt more energetic when she walked up the stairs.   I do wish that Carlomagno had stuck to the "sacrifices" that she made. I mean, she only gave up each of the items for a month and then reverted back. Sure, cell phone and newspapers might be difficult things to give up forever, but what about television and cursing and elevators and even coffee. Surely these can be eliminated totally if she sets her mind on it? I mean if caffineated coffee is bad for health, one could switch to green tea (which is touted as a healthier choice) henceforth after having broken the need for coffee for a month.  Well, flaws notwithstanding, the items picked by Carlomagno could be jumpstarts for readers to follow. The pace of Carlomagno's book is fast and an easy read. I like the book size (7.4 x 6.5 x 0.8 inches).  Should you buy it? Probably not. Borrow it if you could. I know for sure our local library stocks this book. 
  What a waste of time. What this book describes is nothing more complicated or profound than the NLP technique called "parts negotiation" - described at humungous length. What makes the book different is the massive amount of New Age crud that it inserted into the text at every possible opportunity.  According to the authors there are 5 "core states", or are they "clusters of core states" - the authors don't seem sure.  We allegedly all have these 5 states:  "While these states are in one sense univeral experiences, in another sense they are unique to each person and each part of us."  Sorry?  If they are universal experiences, why we need a book to teach us how to experience them?  And if, as the authors acknowledge, "parts" don't actually exist except in a metaphor, how can any "part" have any kind of  experience at all?  By the way, these 5 "universal experiences" are:   - Being  - Inner peace  - Love  - OKness  - Oneness  Oh, wow, like heavy, heavy vibes, man!  Was this book written in the 1990's, or the 1960's?  New Agers and people constantly on the lookout for "trippy" experiences will probably love this book.  For everyone else, why bother 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 If you have a degree in chemistry and feel comfortable working in a laborary environment this is a good book for you. I have found making milk-based soaps easy and fun but not as a result of Makela's book, which makes it seem intimidating, time staking and well, down right confusing.  If you crave simplicity pass on this soapmaking book 
 I really cannot understand why this book has earned its acclaimed classic status.  It has little beyond the usual tired trading psychology:  - don't bet all your capital in one idea; - cut your losses; - follow the trend while it's good.  That's all - seriously, who still has not known about all these points, and for free?  Most of the interviews have not delved deep enough into how these traders analyze a trading idea, what frame work they use, why system, what data source they follow etc.  Most of the time, I have to conclude that they did it by pure luck.   Here is an example.  "... I had a plan.  I would wait until the market moved up to a certain level and then retracted by a specified amount before adding another unit..."  How did he come up with the level?  And why specified amount??  It reads terribly like he just got it off the charts!!!  Let's face it.  If I am a big, profitable trader who is still making money off my supposedly ingenius trading system, would I want to publish it in a book and share it with the rest of the world?  There you have it.  I would not want to waste your time or mine any more on this grossly over-rated book 
 Try as hard as I can,  I cannot find a purpose in this book other than for the authors to make some money.  It barely touches on the options in VS2005 without any concrete direction or in-depth description of why to use the features.  I have found that the VB2005 book I purchased at the same time as this ("Visual Basic 2005 : The Language") provided much better coverage than this book  I would NOT reccommend this book to anyone.  You would find a much more effective use of your money by buying the above book or a book on the targer language in VS2005 you are usin 
 I ordered this piece and the matching chairs.  I have waited since July for them to be available.  They became availabe in September, so I ordered them.  They kept moving the delivery date and then canceled the chairs - said they couldn't get them.  So I  had to cancel the sofa as well. Now I am stuck with 2 chaise lounges and a coffee table but no other furnitue!! 
 I am both astounded and confounded by the reviews here.  Simply put, this is the single worst novel I have ever read.  Everything about it--the writing, the characters, the story--is godawful.  Here follows an absolutely true story.  While I was forcing myself to read this drivel, I went out on date.  She and I were discussing how much of a book one should read before giving up on it.  I was advocating the 25 page litmus, and she insisted on at least fifty.  She did several long train commutes a week to and from work, and so read a lot of novels.  Anyway, I started describing this book.  She recognized it immediately, and interrupted me saying, "The Bear Went Over The Mountain!  Don't read another word!  If you think it's bad now, it only gets worse, if you can believe it!"  She was right.  If you feel the need to find out for yourself, save your money and borrow it from a friend or the library 
 This book may have been okay when it was published but using it as a text in 2007 is a big mistake my instructor really regrets. There are many other guides that are lower in price and have more concise and up to date information available. Do not waste your time with this one. Many of the descriptions are ambiguous and hard to follow 
 I knew after 1983 things would never be the same with Rock and Roll ever again. The music was becoming more clean sounding with technology more or less replacing the majority of musicians. This would be one of the first ones. I remember hearing the first single from this which was "Little Red Corvette" I still say probably one of Prince's best songs, and the only other tune that's passible is "Let's Pretend We're Married". Everything else is horrible. The title track to me is a mindless, brainless dance tune, and I feel has no inadmissable value to life. Unfortunately, I guess the only way to get girls is to like this song. I also didn't take too much fancy to the other hit which was "Delirious". I am somewhat disappointed with this as to me Prince is a gifted performer, and plays a decent guitar, so why go technical? I just am appalled at the way music wound up, and it all started here 
 Here's a list of what's wrong with this item:<br /> 1. You'll stain your wrist trying to screw in the hex and other screws.<br /> 2. The wood is cheap and can split when screwing in screws.<br /> 3. The wood panel for the drawer was warped and didn't fit.<br /> 4. It's from J.P. Products - who doesn't provide customer service during listed business hours, nor do they have a web site.<br /> Overall: avoid this product. It's a shame Target is willing to offer such an inferior item.<br /> 
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 I have found Ehlert's books to be wonderful in the past, however, this book was really disappointing!!  I couldn't believe that this was a book for young children.  I would not read this book to my children! 
 I ordered this book because of the reviews but the reviews are for a different book!  This book is basically a calendar that you use to fill in what you ate and what exercise you did and note how it made you feel.  It is a companion book to The Chemistry of Success.  I bought it used so I'm not out alot of money and its my own fault for not reading the editors reviews more carefully.    
 Now I try to limit my caffeine intake to the bare minimum, like in tea.  I do not drink coffee.  So when I took Stacker 3 (just ONE PILL) I was jittery and could not fall asleep.  I stayed wide awake the whole night and through the day.  I felt nauseus too.  Now this was probably because I don't drink coffee or anything that has a lot of caffeine in it, but I don't recommend Stacker 3 anyway 
 The title pretty much sums it up, I think this book is pretty bad 
 After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.   Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the "protective" pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time 
 Clarity of CD and DVD not good compared to "Caught In The Act 
 Ok what was the point of this book? It was nothing more than a study of oversexed, kinky, S&M-obsessed perverts throughout the course of a windy day in Los Angeles. Rechy's overused symbol of the "Sant'Anas" was eventually annoying and his pervasive sexual language and scenarios had no artistic merit whatsoever and no purpose other than thoroughly grossing out this (gay) reader. Save your time and read a true gay masterpiece- "Dancer From the Dance"- instead. I regret picking this one up 
 *No Spoilers* We had enough of lame Japanese films. This new "wave" of horror movies like "The Ring," "Pulse" and now "The Grudge 2" doesn't seem to have an end. The genre is played out but that didn't stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow-up of the decent 2004 first version. To understand this film--which is nearly impossible until the end--you would have to see the first movie.  Brief Story: The film has basically three plots, but in a way they are connected to each other. The first plot is a follow-up of what happened to Karen Davis (Sara Michele Gellar) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house. Mrs. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) asks her other daughter Aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister Karen. She travels to Japan to bring Sara home. Now in Japan, she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house, but something terrible is about to happen.  The second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house. One of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we don't know about. Suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child. She tries to get out but the door jammed. They all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost. Unfortunately, they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited.   The third plot takes place in the US where a new family moves to an old building. A young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the "strange lady" that lives next door has something to do with it. People are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence.   Review: Less scary and sillier than the original, "The Grudge 2" takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience. The movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them. We have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other. This time around the ghosts are outsourcing from Japan to the US. They don't care whether you visit the house or not. Now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason. These ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way--even a young little boy--just to show their rage. The so-called scary moments are not scary at all. They are lame, mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version. What's sad is that, this time around, the writers have to make the actresses show some "skin" to please the male teen audience. This is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie.  In the technical department the movie doesn't do a good job either. The editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion. We have three plots that are poorly mixed together. Sometimes we are in Japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the US. The photography of the film is identical to its predecessor, but that's the only thing that resemblances the original. In the sound department, the movie will make you laugh. We hear sillier noises than the original. Instead of getting scared, you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make--We personally like the angry "kitty" sound.  The Verdict: A terrible sequel of a decent horror film, "The Grudge 2" could have been a straight-to-video release if it wasn't for the beautiful Sara Michelle Gellar. No scary moments but many funny ones--unintentionally, of course.  
 Book was OK.  Written for everyone, house people, career people, etc.  Different occupations require different time allowances 
 Words cannot describe how ripped off and disappointed I feel about buying this book.   Having read RDPD and CFQ in the Kiyosaki range previously and finding them great, I thought this book would be great as well. I'm sorry to say it's the worst book I've ever read. The entire book is a blatant sales brochure for all his other books.   There's all these annoying references where you get a little bit of information and then instructions that if you want to know more, you need to buy one of his other books. I didn't get any useful information and it's certainly not a 'how to' book. I thought I would be reading about him and his wife's story but all I got was the same few points said over and over again. He doesn't even try to say them in a different way.  The other annoying thing was his promotion of network marketing as a good business option. It was obviously done to help sweeten the deal he has with the network marketing association who recommend all his books to their members.   I could seriously go on and on about why you shouldn't waste your money on this book but I won't.  I have NEVER written a book review on amazon before as I have never felt so strongly about a book. I generally feel if I get even just 1 thing out of reading a book then it was well worth it. In this case I didn't get anything out of it and felt really used and taken advantage of which is why I decided to post this review.   I hope it saves someone else from wasting their money. Buying this book WILL NOT HELP YOU RETIRE YOUNG OR RETIRE RICH 
  	The book Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage is about the economy and the impact one scientist had on the world with his predictions.  Hubbert's theory stated that in the early 1970's oil production would reach its highest level. He was doubted my many scientists, but when it came true scientists used it to look at what the future holds for oil production. It is expected to hit this decade at some point. This book describes the origin of oil and development over the many years. It also describes several different oil fields and the prosperity of them, and the different types of techniques and bits used to find oils by scientists. Each scientist has different methods of finding the oil fields, and they use data sets to record the sites and sizes of them. It provides an overview of what the future holds for oil production, and what different kinds of energy we can resort too if needed to avoid the economic troubles lying ahead. 	I thought this book was overall pretty boring. I wasn't  entertained or hooked on it, and it didn't make me want to keep reading in the end. I found it very confusing most of the time, and it had a lot of information to try to digest all at once, such as numbers and equations. It wasn't the kind of book I really get indulged in, and want to read more of, or cant put down.  	I would recommend this book to those who like to read books about our economy and what's going on in different industries. This book is easier to read for adults, as it contains advanced material that could confuse younger children. For those who enjoy reading advanced books about our economy or oil, this is an excellent book. 
 Basic primitives? Professor Milner,           If you are writing a book for students,           it helps if you make it comprehensible.          We didn't all go to Cambridge 
 Regardless of whether you agree with Hendershott's views, you must admit that there isn't any actual sociology in Hendershott's book. There is virtually no reference to social science research, except to criticize studies without any reason except that she doesn't like the results. Instead, Hendershott provides anecdotal evidence from nonscientific sources as if it is generalizable.   There are two testable hypotheses in Hendershott's book. First, that definitions of deviance have changed greatly over time. Second, that this shift in definitions has affected people's behavior in negative ways. Both of these are easily testable hypotheses, but she unfortunately doesn't test either of them, and just provides examples that support her arguments. This is what sociologists call relying on an "N of 1." She should have learned that as an undergrad.   I hope this review helps you avoid the massive time-waste that reading this book would be. Instead, I'd suggest reading Joel Best's "More Damned Lies and Statistics," which points out very well how dangerous it is to rely on examples and case studies as if they represent large-scale social patterns. 
 Wow.  This basically boiled down to a waste of about ( ) of the book's purchase price.  Before you buy, beware.  This would probably be a good book for you if you are just out of school or are just getting started in "the biz". However, as an experienced musician who thought this  title might provide some helpful marketing tips and ideas, I was very  disappointed.  Its extremely basic.   Also, Weissman's idea of what  constitutes a local music market seems to be off as well-I would consider  Boston, or Portland or any of these cities major metropolitan areas-- not  just New York, LA, Nashville and Chicago.  At least 2 chapters are wasted  on the history of the music scenes of some cities, including those I just  mentioned-- how is this important to you if you live in a small  Metropolitan area, such as Harrisburg, where I'm at?  Also, as a former  Boston resident, I don't think Weissman really does the city's scene  justice-- major acts besides New Kids on the Block have been broken out of  Beantown-- look no farther than the Mighty Mighty Bosstones or Aerosmith.  However, there was some interesting, albeit vague, info about the Union,  Grants, and Artist in Residence programs. I would think that someone with  the qualifications of Weissman would be able to offer much more specified  info instead of vague statements such as "Try to set up a meeting with  the Creative Director of an Ad Agency".  But, then again, maybe its  supposed to be more of an overview kinda book. If you're just getting  started, this might be a good book for you.  If you're out there doing it  full time, look elsewhere- there's not much I got out of this book 
 After listening, with some frequency, to the "Shaman" album, I noticed this song popping up on the radio-waves.  Instead of the growling, slightly-angsty version sung by Nickelback's frontman, we get this smoothed-over, watery version that is much more radio-friendly, and is much less appealing 
 Please stop.  To pass these couplets off as poems, as blues even!  Read my lips: UGH!  Jelly Roll, you ain't so good and if that's all the brothers have got, we in serious trouble.  Out 
 Written by a failed spiritual seeker turned anti-spiritual polemical secularist, this book lacks the substance and insight possessed by a vaguely similar but nevertheless far superior work of disenchantment, Jeffrey Masson's *My Father's Guru*.  Having spent three years attempting without success to follow the Sufi path, Ibn al-Rawandi in this book returns to Sufism but weakly flails about in his efforts to exact from it his revenge.  Ultimately his message is that if you are a rationalist and do not believe in spiritual transformation, do not get involved in Sufism.  Sound advice--but isn't this obvious?!  The bottom line, though, is that a good piece of yellow journalism should at least be a juicy and engaging read.  Sadly, this work is by and large flat.  So if you want a book on spiritual disenchantment, read Masson. If you want something on Sufism, read anything but Ibn al-Rawandi 
 I thought the plot was ok and I personally like Mina but I had trouble getting through the book because it is full of typos. Very dissapointing quality, editing wise 
 Okay, this book LOOKED good from the description.  That's about all I've got.  Once I started reading it, I realized that it was a collection of icky horror stories that were really more disturbing and likely to cause a nightmare than I'm comfortable with.  If that's the kind of thing that you're into, then...would you like my copy??  ;- 
 I tried to read this book.  I really tried.  I got it on sale because I'd heard of the author and was curious.  This is the first book in my memory that I have put aside because I hated every sentence in it.  Normally I struggle through the first part of a "boring" book and become pleasantly surprised by the end.  I just couldn't get past the first fifty pages, and not without lack of effort.  The sad part is that I wanted to like this book and made an honest effort to, but the author made that impossible for me.  My advice is don't read this one - there are better books out there.  Who knows, in a few years I may even be willing to try one of Eco's earlier works.  Then again, I hate this book so much that I doubt I'll even be willing to concede to that.  If you like "historical" fiction, try Carter Beats the Devil or the Venus Throw, which are a lot more fun to read 
 Before browsing through Dear Donald, Dear Bennett, the reader should immediately peruse a copy of At Random, Bennett Cerf's memoirs, so he has a chance of understanding what he is reading in this book. I can't believe Random House would treat the personal letters of their founders in such a shabby fashion. Virtually no footnotes, no annotation, no index---nothing. They might as well be putting out the memoirs of Anna Nicole Smith, rather than the keepers of one of the great literary storehouses of the twentieth century. Before spending any money assembling this volume for publication (if indeed they spent any at all!), the editors should have acquired a copy of The Noel Coward Diaries and followed it religiously as a guide. In that volume, Graham Payn and Sheridan Morely obviously spent months poring over every inch of copy, meticulously footnoting each and every name and archane reference so that upon completion, the reader would easily be able to tell the difference between Bob Menzies and Bobby Andrews, the Duke of Kent from the Duke of Windsor, and easily tell whether Sir Noel was writing about Elizabeth Taylor the film star, Elizabeth Taylor the English novelist, or Elizabeth Taylor the non-celebrity dear friend to Coward's inner circle. Here, the editors (who are unnamed and rightly so) merely say that Saxe Commins was a senior editor at Random House and Robert Haas a partner without furthur definition. (More time is spent discussing the typeface of this volume than virtually anything else.) Most readers of these letters would be interested in the details such annotation would provide. Yes, the letters do paint a wonderful picture of the day-to-day operations of the company, the trials and tribulations of America at war, and the deep affection between the two men. It's a shame the present-day editors at Random House did not see fit to put together a better tribute of their founding fathers 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 Esposito sure has a nice way of glossing over the truth.  The heart of the matter is missed and the fundamental force behind the Islamic faith is left in the corner of the closet somewhere.  Since he shared his ideas, and we do have 1st Amendment rights, here are mine - the Islamic faith and the teachings of the Koran are to drive the believer of these misconceptions with a goal of world domination - religiously and if necessary, violently.  How blatant and how clear the Koran is.  How necessary for us to realize that to stop the core of this terrorism is to stop the spread of this "religious system", or dare I/we say - militant system?  It's also time to put an end to political correctness 
 I'm going to differ with the more positive reviewers for one reason only. Yes, the book provides excellant information, but the most valuable part of titles like this is the included example software. Which should enable you to develop some skills based on what the book teaches you.  In this case, the title is based on OpenGL. If you want to work for Blizzard, or Sony, or NCsoft, or any of the major gaming houses (with 1 or 2 notable exceptions, but they are SMALL houses) you have to be very skilled with DirectX.  Hence, the book fails in the practical area. 
 I purchased two of these items through Amazon.  One of the units worked briefly, then quit; the other never worked at all.  Under the vendor's return policy, I returned these items (at my own expense) to the vendor for a refund and ordered two more directly from the vendor.  Only one of these additional two units worked.  That's three out of four defective--a 75% failure rate, and the buyer has to pay the return costs.  Further, this is not the first time I've had problems with "GE SmartHome" products.  An earlier purchase of other items of the same brand from another vendor also produced defective merchandise.  I would give these items ZERO "stars," if that were possible 
 This CD is very disappointing.  My husband and I have become big fans of a wide range of "all ages" music and were optimistic about this CD, which was put together for a good cause. We just got through listening to it with our 2-year old and were surprised at how listless all the cuts were.  There is not one fun, bouncy, danceable tune in the bunch--with the exception perhaps of the Indigo Girls cut.  Our son loves to dance and really enjoys engaging music.  This compilation edges toward the depressive at times.  Even "Pure Imagination" hits a few too many minor notes for such a joyful song.  
 The title of this book says it all.  "The Panic-Free Pregnancy..." probably does relieve panic for expecting mothers, but it does so at the cost of potential harm to the fetus. Numerous statements in this book are completely misleading and inaccurate. It may be comforting for those who want to hear it's alright to drink alcohol or other well established risky behaviors, but it would be better for them to simply use a little common sense.  Obviously, there are two extremes (too much or too little caution) and the truth is somewhere in the middle, not where this book pretends it is.  Don't waste your time reading or money purchasing this book. 
 I was able to finish this book, unlike Gilead but this author is soooo boring!  Will not read another by her, no matter what the reviews 
 I recently read Robert Monroe's first book, "Journeys Out of Body" and found it to be a disappointment - it was just weird. As I noted in my review of that book, I had hoped that the author would discuss his use of sound, for which he is allegedly noted. As I purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read, I thought I'd give it a try.   The book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his "research" and I thought that, perhaps, this book might actually have some real substance. That belief; however, quickly disappeared. By the time I had reached the half-way point in the book, nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish. How does total garbage like this manage to get printed?!  There are those that claim that Monroe was a highly left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right-brain. If this book is any indication, one can't help but wonder if Monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere! There is nothing logical or, for that matter, even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book. It would have been worthwhile if Monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner. Instead, he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own, personal, dream experiences: these wander so aimlessly, from paragraph to paragraph, that one can't help but wonder what real point, if any, he was trying to make.  The really sad thing is that I had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - I was actually quite interested in the topic. Having now been subjected to two of his useless books, I'm amazed that they're still in print. This is pseudo-science at its absolute worst. 
 Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking.  This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics.  Rather than writing a laconic outline of physics, Zukav spends the majority of his time praising Eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective.    The reader is referred to any college physics textbook or Isaac Asimov's History of Physics or a good set of encylopedias.   
 This book takes a fascinating subject---the lives of Gypsies in the USA---and reduces it to anthropological formulae and scholarly babble. It might be impressive to other anthropologists, but it's largely unreadable  to mere mortals. It's a shame, because obviously the author has done some  interesting research on a people that are hidden within our midst 
 This is not a jockstrap.  It is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity.  I tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable, let alone not exactly hygenic!  No surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup.  Probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by RIPS 
 Wow, what a stinker! Kevin Kline, Harvey Keitel and Alan Rickman can't save this movie.  Poorly written, poorly directed, and terribly acted.  One would expect Rod Steiger to go over the top, but Danny Aiello is just as bad.  Stay away from this.  I paid about $2 for the DVD and felt I overpaid.  Hard to believe I wasted perfectly good electricity to witness this drivel.  Did I mention the movie was lousy 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 Although this dictionary's contents are extensive, the screen functions are relics from the DOS era.  They are laborious and clumsy.  To find a word for difinition, it has to be spelled perfectly, there's no list of proximations to the word entered.  Changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn't show up in the entry slot. If someone knows of a better software, I'd sure like to hear cause this thing sucks!!  Maria McGowan  
 This book has about 3 interesting chapters; the rest is all dialog between a man and wife.  All this chit chat does nothing to further the plot, but simply takes up time and space.  There is no suspense until the 49th chapter.  Take my word for it; this book is not worth the $$, or time to read.  What a waste of talent.  
 A picture showing James Dean and Elia Kazan visiting the East of Eden set claims they're doing so in 1955 when they were probably actually visiting it in 1954 (the year they actually made EOE). I never thought of Kazan as being one of the greatest directors ever and I still don't. He's certainly no Alfred Hitchcock or Cecil B. deMille or Steven Spielberg. 
 This book by Ron Rhodes and Marian Bodine is nothing short of a series of straw-man argumentation and non sequiturs, alongside scriptural eisegesis (and I say this as someone qualified in theology). In one of his claims, he asserts that the hill in New York is THE Hill Cumorah of the Book of Mormon. There are a number of things wrong with this. While some have accepted such to be the case, the internal geography of the Book of Mormon refutes such. The Book of Mormon makes clear that the demise of both the Jaredites and the Nephites took place near the narrow neck of land. Yet New York is thousands of miles away from any plausible configuration that could be described as this narrow neck of land. Thus the scripture itself rules out the idea that the Nephites perished near Palmyra, and that the hill in New York was not known as Cumorah until 1835, becoming a namesake. Furthermore, Mormon 6:6 claims that the records Mormon had, except the plates he gave his son, Moroni, which would be the source of the Book of Mormon, were buried in Cumorah, revealing that the final resting place of the Book of Mormon plates is notthe same hill as the Cumorah of the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon's internal geography, material culture, and so forth, gives 15 main characterisitcs of either the Hill Cumorah or the surrounding area:   ï¿½        Cities in the vicinity of the hill ï¿½        Towers or steeped pyramids for religious purposes ï¿½        Efficient agriculture ï¿½        Metallurgy ï¿½        Formal political states ï¿½        Organised religion ï¿½        Idolatry at certain times ï¿½        Craft specilisation ï¿½        Trade ï¿½        Writing ï¿½        Weaponry in the immediate vicinity of the Hill ï¿½        Astonomy ï¿½        Calander ï¿½        Cement ï¿½        Wheels   With the exception of crafts and trade, of which there were but little, the vicinity of Palmyra vicinity does not match up to the criteria above. Indeed, most serious Book of Mormon scholars have shown that all Book of Mormon events fit the milleau of Mesoamerica, namely southern Mexico, Northern Guatamala, and some models, Belize. Contra some popular belief, however, most models have little, if any, overlap with Maya areas. The hill that best matches the Book of Mormon's Hill Cumorah is Cerro Vigia in Southern Mexico, fitting all the criteria above. Indeed, even weaponry has been found around the general vicinity of the hill. Full archaeological digs there still has to be undertaken, and one must keep in mind the difficulties pertinent to archaeological searches in Mesoamerica, and the inherent difficulties attendant to the fact that Mesoamerican cultures built on top of the ruins of conquered nations and destroyed all their records. Notwithstanding, the relationship between the Book of Mormon and Mesoamerica reveals great promise, with patience being the key.  Much more could be said about the misrepresentations to the teachings, scriptue, and beliefs of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. One such claim is that no Book of Mormon sites, independent of the Biblical texts, have been discovered. Again, this is flawed. Nahom and Bountiful (1 Nephi 16:34; 17:5) have been discoverd in the Arabian Peninsula (e.g., see "In the footsteps of Lehi" [Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Books, 1994] by the Astons). Indeed, a review of the book can be found at my Website, and I welcome feedback at irishlds87@yahoo.co 
 Marx'claims about the timing and the manipulative origins of nationalism do not quite fit the facts. I will show that one consequence of Marx's thesis may be a variant of Hugh Trevor Roper's view of  Hitler as a traditional European statesman. Viz., Hitler fostered German development toward an enlightened society [the Federal Republic?] by conjuring religious [/ethnic] disharmony to consolidate Nazi power. [Of course, as Sauer has shown about the Gauliter system, fascists aimed at a return to pre-modern, de- centralized, charismatic forms of organization. So not all nationalism serves a centralization aim.]  Marx's  mistaken thesis rests upon tendentious examples. Neo- [Karl] Marxists have maintained since mid- 2oth century that elites manipulated antecedent nationalism to achieve political cohesion against foreign enemies. T Marx merely takes the thesis that nationalism was manipulated [e.g., in WWI] to subvert class solidarity, next internalizes it to apply to intra-state cohesion, then projects this twisted commonplace backward as a sort of genetic fallacy. Rather,the most portentous exclusionary[eliminationist?] European nationalism was ultimately the Germanic variety. But its genesis (e.g., Herder, Goethe- the latter being the quintessence of liberalism qua Aufklarung] plainly predated any serious political centralization efforts beyond Joseph II's. Marx' move here must be to claim there since there was no nation-building before Bismarck, ergo the prior nationalist movement [e.g., resistance to Napoleon] does not qualify as nationalism of the right sort [did not culminate in liberal state?? but cf the Hitler rumination above]. Ergo, the German experience is disqualified as a counter- example and so cannot count as evidence against his statist incubation thesis. But dismissing this counter- example by disallowing it demonstrates that, at bottom, his thesis is a mere recommendation about how historians should use the honorific "modern nationalism". That is, his enterprise is revealed as attemppting to establish a stipulative definition of nationalism. It is not a historical account of nationlism's development. Alternatively, he must modify his conclusion so that royal centralization did not originate nationalism, but deformed it into his procrustean mold. But when did state- induced nationalism arise, even in German lands?      What about Marx' temporal claim that nationalism was the product of [royal] centralization in the early modern epoch?  The dynamic of centralization, particularly in France [but also in the Holy Roman Empire] began centuries before. It did not start with exclusionary cohesion/ religious factionalism in the 15th century, but with a conflict with the papacy in the 11th. The Investiture Contest with the Pope ostensibly concerned the king/ emperor's rights vs that of the Pontiff in nominating bishops to be invested with consecrated ecclesiastical -- and political/ temporal-- authority. As bishops were among the super- castellans of that feudal epoch, this effort to create a national church - one in liege service to central authority- was at least a progenitor of the nationalist phenomenon Marx attempts to explain. Not a mass movement, Marx objects?  Perhaps the later Reformation era factionalism mobilized and augmented the nationalism implicit in the 11th and intervening centuries. But nationalism was not the product of that later conflict 
 I actually wish they had given us director commentary on this disc because I would have listened to a little of it just to see what Barry Levinson was thimking and I would cross my fingers and hope he would blame the whole thing on a really bad drug trip. Take a look at the man's filmography and tell me if you think this absolute disgrace belongs there. Worse, he wasn't alone, SOMEONE ELSE liked the idea enough to co-write it. Everyone else can blame a large paycheck, but Levinson actually came up with the idea. This is one of the most beautiful terrible films I ever seen, if they took one tenth of the imagination they put into the set and toy designs and invested it into the screenplay they might have had a movie 
 I agree with all the other one star reviews (would give it zero if I could).  The author is a snob who  doesn't see the people whose lives she is supposedly reporting on as human beings in any way equal to herself.  If they take their "menial" jobs seriously she looks down on them.  She demeans hard work and celebrates entitlement.  For another view of the poor with some conception of how people's behavior shapes their lives, read LIFE AT THE BOTTOM. 
 What a joke! I have read alot of books on faeries. After reading all of R J Stewarts` books and Faery Teachings by Orion Foxwood this seams like fiction. I could bearly bring myself to finish it. I can`t beleive the author is the UK`s top authority on faeries. Very sad. 
 If you've read Nicci French, you will recognize the opening hook of this book, only Nicci French did it much better (and with a watermelon!).  Almost everything after that hook (young woman performs heroic deed, is captured in paper, attracts attention of at least one potentially dangerous man) is pretty predictable and disappointing.  I'm not really a thriller snob.  I don't mind a little romance thrown in with my suspense (there's a reason I mentioned Nicci French - I like her!) and I don't need a thriller writer to be Hemingway.  But "Beautiful Lies" just really doesn't work even as an escapist book.  The other reviewer is absolutely right that this book reads sometimes like a Harlequin romance novel. (From about twenty years ago.) Other times, the tone makes attempts at doom and foreboding.  Everything is communicated by an overly familiar, "aren't I cool?" narrator who is not in fact too cool -- her commentary reads kind of like your aunt's idea of "what one of those Sex and the City girls might say."  At no point does she convince me that she actually IS cool.  In fact, despite the overfamiliarity, at no point in this book did I believe it was a real person narrating this story, even though that's obviously the tone the author was going for.  On top of that, the plotting was not surprising or new in any way, and every "twist" in this book was telegraphed from a mile away.    I know I sound harsh, but I'm just disappointed, because I really wanted to like this book.  The writer obviously has talent, and this was a good idea that could have been better developed.  Plus, there are occasional glimpses of interesting, thoughtful writing.  But they're way too few and far between to make the other 90 percent of this book worth reading.   I finished this book with the impression that Unger strayed from the book she wanted to write and ended up trying to write a Nicci French book instead.  I wish this author would write the book I saw occasional glimpses of here, when the narrator knocked off the cutesyness and the book got a little darker and more interesting.  I have a feeling that if she wrote that book, it would be good.  Till then, though, I have to give this book a very disappointed two stars (with an extra star for potential). 
 I could not manage to get through the whole of this book, and in fact gave it away, because Mitnick is so pompous as to make a subject that is so thoroughly interesting so painful to get through.  Seriously, he must have none of his over-inflated personality left because I think it all dripped out of my book 
 Don't take my word for it that's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on Slashdot.   Be warned: Adobe has not learned its lesson, and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6, this latest release of Acrobat continues Adobe's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment, again, as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done--in fact, it's now nearly impossible. Like earlier releases, this version of Acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "right click" menus. Adobe argues that these are conveniences, but they are entirely unnecessary (for most of us "printing" to Adobe PDF achieves the same result, is much more convenient, and a more natural model), and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface (for those who don't have the knowledge or patience to customize it) or a carefully tuned one (for those who do). Unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior (e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog), Acrobat's "option" for disabling this behavior, once deeply hidden in the setup process,is now almost completely absent. To disable the "Convert to Adobe PDF" button that mysteriously appears in the Outlook mail editor, for example, one has to be sure to choose "this feature will not be available" from the "Microsoft Outlook" option under "Acrobat PDFMaker" under "Create Adobe PDF". Simply deleting the button using Outlook's toolbar customization feature will not work: it comes right back when the editor is next opened. Similar problems arise in Word, Excel, Visio, Project, and Internet Explorer. And there's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "Convert to Adobe PDF" and "Combine in Acrobat..." entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files (even if one installs none of the Acrobat PDFMaker features).   For the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that Acrobat 7 does, there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web, but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7: ("Adobe has really pushed the boat out with Acrobat 7 and managed to screw Word royally") .   In short, Acrobat will make a mess of your working environment, there's no way to completely fix it, and even the partial fix is a pain (and not well documented). (This may seem a minor issue, but if every application followed Adobe's reckless example, our working environments would start to look like strip malls, crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it. One of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs; no application should interfere with that.)   Experienced Acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for Acrobat (and most other Adobe applications): it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version. In fact, on my 2 GHz Pentium 4, it takes longer to launch than the entire Visual Studio .NET development environment, and longer than the boot sequence for Windows XP!   There are other minor problems as well (arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items, etc.) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough. Unless you really need the latest Acrobat features, you should probably avoid this upgrade. And if the "improvements" in this release are any indication of where Adobe plans to go with future releases, it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management.   Fortunately, there's no reason at all to upgrade. Version 7 offers no usefully new features, so you can (and should) avoid this one (at all costs) 
 Wilkinson used a simple but effective teaching aid - 3 chairs which are used to represent 3 portraits or spiritual states in which everyone in the world can be divided into as illustrated in the diagram below:  CHAIR ONE - commitment, saved, spiritual	       CHAIR TWO - compromise, saved, carnal 	                 CHAIR THREE - conflict, unsaved, natural  His thesis that by identifying which chair we are sitting on at present, we can make a `spiritual breakthoughs' by making a decision to move from one chair to another.   Firstly, in an effort to make the concept relevant, Wilkinson have oversimplified the process of spiritual growth without reference to grace, spiritual formation, character development and development of new worldview. He seems to give the impression that spiritual breakthroughs is easy and achievable by human effort alone.  Secondly, there is weak theological support for his thesis except using Paul's terms (spiritual, carnal and natural man). In his Biblical example, he used Joshua, elders and children of elders. While he made his point of generational slide, the children of elders were disobedient rather than non believers. But it is true that there is a generational slide if each generation do not develop personal faith in Jesus.  Thirdly, Wilkinson meant the three chairs for Christians, backslidden Christians and non-Christian but there is no reference to the work of Jesus Christ on the cross and of the Holy Spirit in spiritual transformation. Wilkinson seems to imply that spiritual growth can take place by decision making alone.  There cannot be movements between the chairs without adequate appropriation of the theology of the cross and inner transformation without the work of the Holy Spirit especially in his examples of Julia, Ernie and Kate.  Finally, while marriage and parenting is important, one wonders whether the three-chairs model is the right approach. Section 3 & 4 sounds like promotions for Walk-Thru-the Bible Ministries programs. Wilkinson's book promises spiritual breakthroughs but one wonders whether it can delivers except for a short time haze of spiritual high.  
 I know the Inmon vs. Kimball thing has turned into something of a feud. Having owned the first and second edition of this particular book (the first edition is now more useful than ever hollowed out with a knife to hide jewelry) and having browsed through the third edition that a colleague purchased, I must say that the major change since the obscure first edition is that Inmon has now taken a much more defensive tone now that Kimball is out there presenting clear, concise and useful real-world concepts and implementation techniques and gathering followers. I also own Inmon's "Using the Data Warehouse", "Data Warehousing and the Zachman Framework", and "Exploration Warehousing" and the question that comes to mind most after reading through these books is why did I waste the money. The reading is difficult, not so much because the subject matter is difficult, but more because it seems to be dry theory and has little advice on how to actually design a real working data warehouse. When later, Kimball came out with his breakthrough book: "The Data Warehouse Toolkit", it all seemed conceptually so much simpler and straightforward 
 This is an ill-informed fan's one-sided look at the porn industry.  The  author was apparently so in awe of his subjects that he fearfully turned  down the opportunity to be present at the taping of a sex scene between two  porn actors.  In addition,  Mr. O'Toole inexplicably does not include the  details of the porn star Savannah's untimely suicide at the end of her  career.  He refers to her as having "died" after quoting her at  length on her financial success at the height of her career.  This passage  is intended to illustrate that many of the actresses working in adult films  are completely happy doing so. It is inexcusable for him not to mention  that she took her own life after being disfigured in a car accident. Pass  on it 
 I am a Jersey Girl, about Bruce's age and a big Bruce fan, but this book was a total disappointment.  The pictures seem to be  all from one roll of film taken on the same day.  One poster would cover the whole book for a whole lot less money 
 I rented this, and once downloaded it stated that my client license was up.  Tech support couldnt help me, and instead just refunded my money.  It was nothing but a waste of time 
 Diana's other novels I have read and re-read, getting blissfully lost in them each time. But this was didn't fit with the others. A little too "earthy" for my tastes 
 I just received my copy of "A Sense of Place" by Michael Shapiro, billed by the "Dallas Morning News" travel book reviewer as a great book about great travel writer's craft, lives, and inspiration. Most of the Amazon reviews to-date were glowing as well. As a travel enthusiast I quickly purchased and dug into the book and found a blatent hidden agenda. This author is clearly not seeking the great travel writer's adventures as much as he is seeking to underline his opinion that the world hates American policies and our current administration in particular.  Buyer Beware...his book embraces liberalism at its worst. Note two examples: Michael Shapiro on living in San Francisco..."but sometimes I think that we live in these oases of sanity" Then, he asks travel writer Jonathan Raban if he had owned a bumper sticker reading, "Somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot".  Perhaps this travel writer needs a good dose of a year or two of travel in the United States, yes, our "fly over" states.  Does Amazon.com give refunds? I plan to scrutinize your book reviews more carefully in the future for your reviewer's biases.  Don't mislead those of us who truly love to travel and don't want a so-called travel author's pedantic, self-righteous view of American politics. 
 THE SOUND IS BAD. I HAVE TRIED THIS DVD ON 2 DIFFERENT PLAYERS AND IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE 
 I was really excited to receive the Bushnell Instant Replay as a birthday present. However, I quickly learned that it's an incredibly difficult binocular to operate.  First of all, I had trouble opening the battery compartment cover.  I had to pry it out with a knife after many unsuccessful attempts.  Then I had a hard time installing the Flash Memory card.  The instruction booklet was terrible and did not mention the right way to instal it.  I installed it the wrong way and it got jammed so I had to pry it out with a pair of pliers!!  After doing all that, I got the camera to work.  Then I decided I had to instal the software - the driver and the Photosuite.  The driver was installed easily.  Not so the Photosuite.  After three attempts, the icon did not appear nor did it appear on Programs.  I'm returning the camera 
 I adore his series with Precious in No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and purchased The Sunday Philosophy Club in high hopes.  I could not finish it.  I forced my way through half the book hoping it would get better - it didn't.  I finally realized after a month went by and I did not pick it up that I was just not going to finish it.  So I traded it in at a local used book store.  I just never grew to care about the main character and the plot did not progress.  The main character was just a monstrously bored busybody.  I did not see any justification for her actions throughout the book.  And the endless talks of ethical and philosophical dilemmas were grueling - I skimmed through them.    I have been telling everyone not to bother with this book.  It was very disappointing 
 not bad, but not as entertaining as sondheim: a casebook. some of the analyses were quite obtuse (e.g. the lacanian analysis of sweeney todd and the argument that passion is about sondheim's relationship with his mother). i thought one of the more interesting essays was the first one about passion, but there weren't many others that were particularly relevant or insightful 
 As a former reviewer has stated this edition takes quite a bit of liberty in excising the less flattering aspects of Tocqueville's views of America.  In fact the entire section on race-relations has been excised --perhaps it was deemed too controversial?  This kind of editing is even more unacceptable in our age of open communications and hopefully open minds. Find another edition.   
 I read Shogun before and it's binding is falling apart as it was an hand me down. I really expected more... I somewhat expected the characters to be engaging and somewhat realistic. I was left unconvinced by his characterizations of British, American and even Japanese. I actually found the Japanese characters more believable than the "Gai-Jins". The novel is in my mind a failure and the history of the era seem also faulty in it's interpretation. I think that even the names of the Japanese characters are totally false in historical terms from what I can find in history books 
 After 2 attempts at having this shipped to me, and both times having it arrive broken.  I have given up this model.  It's a shame that the poor packaging on the machine is the reason for the rowers rating.  If you can buy one at the store, it may be a great unit, but don't let it go UPS 
 I saw this movie in a theater in 1960, when I was six. What they were thinking showing it at a Saturday matinee of little kids I can't imagine, but that was before ratings. It scared the s*** out of me! That horrible one-eyed alien, and the terrible things that happen when the submarine crewmen are trying to escape! Very, very scary 
 I'm sure this won't win me any popular votes but, this musical is one that I feel I have to comment on. What has happened to Broadway? Why has London's West End taking over the musical theatre industry? Well, when Broadway produces musicals such as "Little Women."  As a fan of the book I had high hopes for the show expecting it to be as beautiful as "The Secret Garden" or "Jane Eyre." But, this musical does not enhance the book in fact it morphs it into some kind of mindless garbage.  The songs are mindless garbage with no feeling, depth, or emotion and listening to the CD is what one Broadway fan might consider torture. There are a few exceptions "Take A Chance On Me" and "Small Umbrella In The Rain" somehow manage to stand out but,are not enough to save this show from a slow death on Broadway.   The cast is dim witted and has little to no connection to the actual characters they are meant to play... Susan Foster who is well known as Millie does a decent job as Joe but, misses that magic sparkle and tom-boy nature that one would expect from the character Joe. Danny Gurwin- however makes a breakthrough apperance as Laurie seeming to be just about perfect and should have recieved a Tony nomination ... I can only hope he makes a few CDs after this show.  It's obvious why when you listen to "Little Women"- how it came to die slowly and painfully on Broadway- the songs and the script lack the sentiments in the book- with no real love story... or perfect ending this musical is a truly tragic loss.  Made for the sole purpose of becoming a money maker knowing that fans of the book would stand by the show- the producers seemed to hope to make a quick buck. But, I will not stand by this show- their is something in the story that could be turned into a musical that fans could enjoy. All in all Broadway needs something more and fans need something else.. 
 Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents. I can see Bill Gates, being a deified bloodsucker, using $100 dollar bills as toilet paper, and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live. SO SHAME ON YOU BILL GATES AND MICROSOFT 
 I thought this book was a stiff and hard to read I don`t this is a good read for a parent 
 Gail's writing is again wonderful in this in book, but I found the book disappointing due to a lack of closure. I felt the book led you up to a particular point in the life of the character's and then left you wondering in the end what the message was meant to be. I almost felt as if the writer wasn't brave enough enough to tell you the ending to a tragic, yet hopeful story. I can only compare this book to the Samurai's Garden since I haven't read a third book by this author yet, and I loved the Samari's Garden! So I was surprised that this book lacked closure at the end. I am not sorry that I read this book due to the fact that I enjoy the author's style of writing 
 if pac was still here now he would never ride with ja nah nah nah nah nah na 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 This book was implausible and boring. Lots of errors that editors should have found -- I'm too uninterested even to bother pointing them out because fixing them won't improve the book anyway. Dumb premise -- stupid characters -- unanswered questions -- bad ending  Where is the "medical" in this thriller?  I am even tired of Jack and Laurie and basketball and unrealistic chase scenes that have absolutely no bearing on the climax of the story or the rationales the doctor provides. Nothing at the end made sense and I didn't like this book at all 
 This book is an outdated snapshot of Wicca in the 1970's. It does not accurately reflect Wicca now, has some incorrect history (especially in regards to the genesis of certain traditions), and is completely impractical.   If you are trying to learn about modern Wicca/Paganism and how to become involved and how to practice...this book will not help you. There is nothing here that shows you HOW to practice, nothing on how to learn, how to study, how to work ritual, and nothing here that gives a clear picture of the basic parameters of the Wiccan/Pagan Religions. It is overly long, too dry, and uninspiring. Completely impractical.  It gets two stars because of a great chapter on the Radical Faeries Movement and Men's Spirituality (wow, there's actually a God in Wicca?) and some interesting photos within.  This book was not for me, I don't recommend it for beginners or old-timers or even in-betweens like myself. It's "okay" but nothing special. Just...boring, and not helpful.  Far more practical, applicable and helpful (and in the same vein timewise and politically) is The Spiral Dance by Starhawk, it gives a much clearer picture and doesn't seem to ramble as much.    
 I found the main character annoying and unbelivable, as she appears much too clever.  Maybe if she solved her crimes completely by accident it would be believable, but outsmart the police?  It is also somewhat offensive to make fun of the things she does--the senility and forgetfulness in old age, joking and laughing about death and funerals.  The sense of humor is an attempt at being silly but it is offensive.  Living in this kind of environment where one is losing friends and family to death, the loneliness and sadness found there, is a topic and setting of bad taste.  My guess is the author herself does not live under such circumstances, but when she does, maybe she won't make jokes about it anymore.  Just another example of how people in our society take lightly and joke about things that should be taken seriously 
 "Raw?"  "Energetic"?  "In your face"? I honstly can't understand how anybody could think the stuff on ISM is any of those things. Energy level is close to that of "The Trinity Sessions", but this band doesn't have the self-discipline - or the vocal & instrumental skills, for that matter - of the Cowboy Junkies, so they go on & on & on & on & on ... meandering dweebishly forever.   Capsule description - high-pitched personality-free vocals that are not IMHO improved by the very free application of reverberberberb, against a background of lethargic mush. Coming soon to garage sales all over the country 
   What's very sad is not only are there children out there who believe that they are some how Xtra special saviors of the universe but seemigly educated adults who haven't moved past the fairy tales of Alice in Wonderland.  Remember, we are asked to sniff the flowers but not to eat them.  Adults who engage in channeling, speak of chakras, describe past lives and fret about some 5th dimension after the year 2012 are one pill short of their medication.  If you have children who behave strangely you have only to look at your own fears and delusions 
 If your looking for a how to book on remodeling your kitchen this is not it. This is more of a book from a idea and design standpoint for remodeling 
 As "Everyman" opens, the main character has already passed away.  From here, the plot moves back and forth in time to see how his life has come to this point.  This includes three unsuccessful marriages and strained relationships with offspring.  Ultimately, "Everyman" concerns how quickly life can pass us by- how death can come and people can be ill even when they feel they should be young and healthy.  And that's just not fair.  Quote: "My God, he thought, the man I once was!  The life that surrounded me!  The force that was mine!  No "otherness" to be felt anywhere!  Once upon a time I was a full human being."  I honestly cannot figure out what it is with folks and this book.  I did not find it to be interesting, nor the characters compelling.  Although I realize that the point could be made that in titling his work "Everyman" Roth is insinuating that the main character is actually representative of any man (who might not be a good man at all), I cannot find this convincing considering that I am unsure of whether the average man early has passionate affairs with European models thirty some odd years their junior . .  . maybe they do.  The virtue of this book is in its look at how an average man reflects on his life and death, but this man is not "average" enough for that to be pulled off here 
 Saved Folk in the House is the debut novel by Sonnie Beverly. It is one novel told in three parts with the characters loosely tied together.  All in all, the characters are presented as being full of enthusiasm and eagerness to bring souls into the kingdom and follow the call the Lord has on their lives.    The first story is about Zakia, a young mother living the good life but finds herself searching for something that is missing in her life.  On a visit to Faith in the Word Church, she gives her life to the Lord and the void is fulfilled. That is until the unthinkable happens in her marriage.  With the same exuberance she had doing the work of the Lord, Zakia turns to the Internet.  Eventually, she finds her way back to the church. The next story involves Zakia's cousin, Nikki, who leaves her drug-addicted husband and moves to Atlanta with her three young children.  She chose Atlanta because she wanted to serve at the Way Maker Church.  Nikki believes her destiny is to work at the church as an accountant.  An unexpected romantic interest also enters her life.  The third story of this novel features three grandmothers;  Grace, who is caring for her grandchildren while their mother is in prison.  Jean, Nikki's mother who is caring for the children during the summer and Alexis, Zakia's mother, who  brings her grandchildren around so they can keep company with the other children.  The children spend the summer playing, working and most of all learning that God  is a prayer answering God.    The characters in the story really did not have much of a voice as Ms Beverly did more telling vs. showing in this book.  The story was fast paced and the time frames progressed quickly.  The most distressing thing to this reader was the inexcusable stereotyping of "saved folks" and misinterpretation of what constitutes being saved.   This reader believes Ms Beverly based  salvation on Romans 10: 9;  for full understanding one would have to read further and include verses 10-14.   There is more to it than repeating a statement.  While I agree sanctification is a process,  one cannot be a drug dealer and be saved.  The Bible speaks of those who blatantly continue to sin.  It is out of order to speak to someone in tongues if you do not have an interpreter.  How does one minister if they have not been ministered to by their leader?  These type of discrepancies with the Word were very bothersome to this reader and took away from the story.  The best part in the book for this reader were the Execs and the positive images they presented of the black male.  Finally, as I was reading this book, I had the feeling of deja vu.  There were some eerie similarities to another novel this reader read recently.      Jeanette   APOOO  BookClub  
 The 1991 "Our Game" is a standalone post cold war spy story by that British master, John LeCarre: and he's written several memorable spy stories, such as "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold," and the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  This book exhibits some of his virtues as a writer: unsurpassed spycraft, strong set piece openings, and closings; plots that might keep a reader up way past bedtime, sharply drawn characters given snappy dialogue, and engrossing narrative and descriptive writing.  The book opens on Tim Cranmer, forcibly retired British cold war spy; luckily for him, he seems to have more than his share of wealthy relatives,enabling a comfortable retirement as a landed winemaker.  He has acquired a beautiful, much younger mistress whom he keeps in luxury.  And he's been able to place his oldest friend, Larry Pettifer, a friendly rival since Winchester, the elite public school(as the English call it; we call them private schools), and the elite unversity, Oxford, in a job nearby.  Mind you, Pettifer was also one of the deskbound Cranmer's spies, or joes, as Le Carre calls them; he was also a double agent, working for the Russians as well.  Yet there's nobody the cold Cranmer has ever been closer to.  Suddenly, Pettifer disappears, taking with him Cranmer's young mistress Emma. (He tells Cranmer:" You stole my life, I stole your girl.")  Cranmer soon discovers that Pettifer has committed himself to a new cause, for which he's taken with him $37 million Russian that he wasn't entitled to.  Cranmer also soon realizes his former employers at the spy shop suspect him of complicity in the theft; and, what's worse, a ruthless Russsian mafia does, too.  So Cranmer goes on the run, to Paris and Russia, remembering his helpful spycraft all the way, as he looks for Pettifer and Emma, while trying to avoid the parties looking for him.  At one point Cranmer muses: "He /Pettifer/ has been goading me about my indifference to the world's agonies....I have said that I never considered myself responsible for the world's ills, not for causing them, not for curing them.  The world was in my view a jungle overrun with savages, just as it had always been.  Most of its problems were insoluble....I have said that I have always been, and would continue to be, prepared to make sacrifices for my neighbours, compatriots, and friends.  But when it came to saving barbarians from one another in countries no bigger than a letter on the map, I failed to see why I should throw myself into a burning house to rescue a dog I had never cared for in the first place."  Now,unfortunately, readers who find that speech resonant, who perhaps are even saying to themselves some variation of: "Right on, brother, couldn't say it better myself," will have a problem.  Because, for reasons never made entirely clear, Cranmer will suddenly pull a 180 in his beliefs, grab a Kalashnikov rifle, and run off to try to put the world to rights himself.  For such readers, this book might not be the best place to start reading Le Carre.  
 This is a "sweet" book that is very reassuring  and interesting to read if you don't have anything better to do.   But as a mom, who has time for this?   Don't we all look up things in a state of diress, hoping to find concrete useful information delivered rapidly in the least words possible? Well, you won't find that here.   This book is full of very nonspecific, sometimes outdated information delivered in a very wordy style. The whole book is written in long paragraphs.  There are very few tables or charts.  IT's VERY wordy.   Just to give you an example, I looked up Fluoride supplementation. It addresses the topic using nearly a FULL page, but never tells you the actual amount your baby should have depending on his age! More concise and concrete information is available in pediatrician Dr. Ari Brown's "Baby 411"!  I gave this book one star because aside from being too general, some of the information in it is outdated, or in the category of "old wives tales" ! Save your money and skip the "what to expect" book 
 Europe is bad, America is good, Number One , best of the world, uniquely great...Well, that is all there is to it here. This book is a constant insult to the intelligence of the reader, whether he be conservative or liberal, given the absurd violence and anger of the tone. Interestingly enough however, as others have pointed out, Rabkin's true haunting fear is not about the European Union, but rather American progressives willing to claim American ideals for the cause of peace and justice 
 Like the bread and was disappointed when I read that only the basic breads were in this book - wanted the actual Panera Bread Recipes.  Changed my mind about buying it for this reason 
 I couldnt even get past the first chapter of this god-awful book. Full of homo-this and homo-that it just became a total and utter bore to read in 10 minutes. No talk of craft or anything constructive - beware 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 Recieved as a present from my wife, poor girl got sold on this thing at Circuit City. Anyway, it was alright...pretty average transmitter. The thing broke immediately after it's 3 month warranty expired. I contacted DLO's customer service and they were rude as heck. I understand the thing is off of warranty but they were no help at all, wouldn't even offer to fix it if I covered the costs. So basically I have a useless piece of plastic and electronics. I bought a Monster iCarPlay and have loved it. It's put together much better, better sound, no annoying little issues, and a more reputable company. Don't spend your hard earned money on DLO...get something that will last. 
 I purchased this to replace the filter on my 04163 unit and although the description (and box) say it is compatible with this unit, it was the wrong size! I still don't know how to order the correct one 
 THIS BOOK DOES NOT EVEN MENTION CLARA BOW, ALONG WITH GRETA GARBO, THE GREATEST ACTRESS OF THE SILENT FILM ERA, AND ONE OF OUR GREATEST EVER. BUY SOMETHING ELSE OR YOU ARE BEING SERIOUSLY MISLED BY THE DIRECTION THE AUTHOR TAKES 
 And now for a dissenting view:  Because of this work (and the lack of any other in-depth scholarship on the subject) people have tended over the years to associate Kenneth Grant with the Qliphoth.  In fact, when you say "Qliphoth", many people immediately think "Grant" without hesitation.  When I started doing my own studies of the World of the Shells in 1994, this was one of the first books I sought out because of its notoriety.  I referenced it many times over the last eleven years, and I have to say that every time I did I found it almost completely useless in terms of giving meaningful information on the Qliphoth.    Grant takes HIS interpretations of the VIII*, IX*, and XI* of OTO, and mixes them with Voodoo, H.P Lovecraft, and a good dollop of (sometimes faulty) gematria.  This array of symbolism he then pigeon holes into 22 pieces which he calls the "Tunnels of Set".  It is my opinion while while this work is very imaginative and creative, it has nothing to do with the Qliphoth.  The Qliphoth are actually the waste and rotting dead matter of the spirit that accumulate when the True Will is neglected.  It's all too human.  Grant doesn't even go there.  In Dion Fortune's _The Mystical Qabalah_ she has a few pages which she devotes to the Qliphoth, and I believe that she has more useful data on them in those few pages than Grant provides in this entire thick, expensive volume.    Unfortunately, There is no one else to recommend at this time as far as the Qliphoth is concerned.  Until someone else provides an alternative, Grant is really all that's out there on this subject (at least nominally).  He's the only fish currently in the pond, and all anybody sees there is him.  This book is a clear example of a case where simply because somebody sounds like they know what they are talking about, it doesn't really mean that they do.  Yes, it's creative, and I like some of the imagery and artwork, but I think that Grant missed the point entirely 
 In "Wilderness Tips" there is no redeeming value in any of the  relationships in any of the stories.  You would expect at least one of the  stories to contain some hope for the future...but in all of the stories  there is an underlying sense of hopelessness and despair.  Any of the  characters that have a sense of self are broken by the end of the story.   What is the point 
 This is a common text for many introductory anthropology courses.   It's apparently a classic ethnographic work, but honestly one of the most boring books I think I have ever read 
 This just in:  William S. Burroughs was the only beat writer with any talent at all and, ironically, if you were to ask your average college type for the names of beat writers Burroughs wouldn't even come to their pot-headed mind.  Allan Disgustingberg, alias Allan No-talent, was a very successful literary fraud.  He was even able to blindside Burroughs, who was a literary genius, into thinking he was a real hairway to steven, er, stairway to heaven.  And this is most astonishing since, if you've ever seen a picture of Allan Disgustingberg, you know that he was about as sexy as my uncle Abe.  
 I am by no means a computer idiot, I audit computer systems security for a living. I have had to contact customer support (webchat) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software. The install was on a brand new system (Windows XP Pro), with all of the Microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed.   First Pest Patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an Active Protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes (which you had to click to clear each one). Second, the firewall would tell me I was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode. Third, Pest Patrol never would run a thorough scan. I'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the Pest Patrol GUI, or that system resources was not available. I contacted the customer support and they told me that yes, sometimes Pest Patrol doesn't work at all unless you use MSCONFIG to disable all startup services (systems.ini, etc) reboot, run Pest Patrol, then use MSCONFIG to enable the startup services. It was a canned reply during a live web session, which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people.  I haven't tried out the third solution yet because I wanted to remind myself to write an Amazon review.  If you are looking for simplicity, or don't know much about computers, look elsewhere. Otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds. I'll give it two stars, since it didn't cause my dog to choke, explode my house, or cause irreparable damage to clothing (which is my one-star).  
 I searched all over for this book. It was even recommended through a business brief published by Business Reference Services Humanities and Social Sciences Division Library of Congress in 1994. So you could only  imagine my dissappointment when I realized this book simply lists a bunch  of addresses over and over again and gives you almost nothing to go on. I  got much more out of a 35 page booklet entitled Your Guide To Free  Government Grants than I did from this over 350 page book. I truly felt  dissapointed and would not recommend this book to anyone searching for a  grant 
 ...this is nothing like the Spirograph I grew up playing with.  As everyone else mentioned, the gears are much too thin and slip constantly.  My 6 year old son was completely frustrated after wrestling with the design flaws.  Don't waste your money! 
 I was recommended this book as I adopted a dog.  I've had dogs, but never an adult rescue dog.  I thought it would give me advice on dealing with issues specific to an adult rescue dog, solutions to problems I may encounter, what to expect, etc.  What I got was a sappy "be patient and love your dog" summary.  Any advice in the book was extremely basic and common sense, especially if you've owned any dog before.  Yes, we need to understand and train our second hand dog, but this book provides NONE of the "how".  I thought it was a complete waste of money.  
 The fact that Sowell is a black man criticizing other blacks doesn't make him any more right or less racist.   The fact that he perpetuates anti-Southern bigotry and invents a connection with ghetto culture and Southern culture doesn't seem to turn anybody off. What he fails to acknowledge is the true connection with criminal behavior and that is institutionalized urban poverty, not Southern culture.   FBI statistics prove this repeatedly.  I don't think Sowell really knows any rednecks.  I grew up in the South; most of my youth was spent in a very small town in a rural county where I was surrounded by rednecks.   I will grant you that they dislike intellectualism (which made me really unpopular) but they weren't any more violent than anywhere else, and in fact I'm often appalled by stories I've heard from friends' kids about the kinds of things that go on in schools now, and I don't live in North Carolina any more.   The rednecks I grew up around, the vast majority of them had very strong Christian faith, and they worked hard even if (usually especially if) they were poor - just like the vast majority of folks who are in the ghettos.  They dislike shows of money and are extremely thrifty to the point of being just plain cheap, which is a stereotypical Scottish/Irish value that Sowell conveniently ignores.  The other positive value we Southerners have retained that everyone else seems to have forgotten is basic manners.  After I left college and moved out of the South I was appalled at the general lack of basic consideration for other people, who didn't greet you on the street or even use "please" and "thank you."  Last, I challenge anyone to prove that Southerners are overall more violent than the rest of the nation, especially given per capita crime rates are much lower in rural areas and the South is mostly rural.  I'm disappointed that only two people seem to be approaching this book with a critical mind, out of over 60 reviewers, and I'm especially disappointed at all the people who continue to applaud    such bigotry.   How long has the Civil War been over?   Not one of you remember it but somehow you can't seem to get over it.  In short, Sowell's arguments would be great if they were all based on fact 
 Simply put, this is one of the books that shattered Schlesinger's credibility as a legitimate historian once and for all.  Once he was "Artie," the precocious high-flying historian/prodigy, amazing his peers & elders with his dazzling talents as an author & scholar.  Now he is a superannuated peddler of Camelot nostalgia and a defender of a school of thought that has been so thoroughly discredited over the years that it truly is a wonder that anyone takes Schlesinger seriously anymore.  Really, the only author/historian that is worse in this field is possibly Manchester.  How can anyone regard this stuff as serious history?  It is as though Schlesinger has sustained a sort of man-crush on JFK for all these years and cannot bring himself to be even remotely objective about a rather undistinguished administration.   He really contributes nothing to this field of study, so save yourself the effort of reading this tripe 
 Ben Franklin is my hero, I have 12 biographies on him, this was the worst. I first started collecting Franklin biographies forty years ago, Van Doren, Fay, Issacson, Brands, Wood and a half a dozen others. At first glance, and after reading the rave reviews it looked like here was something new and different... a new take that concentrated on France. Well it was new, and very different - it put me to sleep in my chair several times. I eventually gave up and shelved it with the others. What a shame. Boring.   
 I am not the biggest fan of anthologies, but I usually enjoy the work of Kenyon and Thompson.  I have to say that Thompson's entry was the one bright spot in an otherwise painful read.  I hate to say it but Kenyon seems to be just marketing on her popularity. She didn't even seem to try on this one.  The characters completely lacked any form of depth.  I couldn't force myself to care what happened to either the protagonists or the bad guys.  The only character that was even remotely entertaining was Esperetta's friend. Even worse than Kenyon's half hearted attempt was Bank's ride the wind.  Her attempts to use slang came out stilted and awkward.  And I agree with the other reviewers that the ending left me completely confused and disappointed.  I know anthologies tie in to other series generally, but at least try and give some kind of explanation of what happened.  The author just jumps ahead 2 decades leaving the reader scratching their head.  Instead of inspiring me to read more of Banks work, this story ensured that I won;t be reading any of the author's work any time soon 
 This is not a great book. Even though it is Puzo, who has done some great work, this story is mediocre at best. I have read every work of fiction by Mario Puzo and I would place this one at the bottom of the pile. It's not a terrible book, but you could do a lot better. The story is about post WWII Germany, and an American soldier named Walter Mosca who is stuck in a daydream of post-war reorganization and exploitation. The story is slow at times, and I found my mind wandering a lot during the middle. It comes together nicely at the end, and is certainly well crafted, but I would recommend this book only to Puzo fans, especially to those interested in reading his complete catalogue. That is basically the only reason I read this book, and it is not one I care to read again. Nor is it a story that will live long in my memory.     Mark McGinty is the author of Elvis and the Blue Moon Conspirac 
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 This author is an overeducated person who writes down all of her overwrought thoughts in the same rambling sequence, the same unedited chunks, just like real life, written down just the way she thinks them.  For me, this was unsatisfying, almost insulting.  I like writing to be edited, thoughts distilled.  Don't waste the reader's time.  Sure the thinking process itself can be interesting, but when it's interesting, it's because it's been  abstracted and refined from real thinking.    She could have written the same content in 60% less words, and that would have made better, kinder reading.    The author is also hyper self conscious of her status as a white, heterosexual, happily married, white collar, intellectual elite, and this gets tiresome because there is no humor sarcasm or self mockery.  I also found her ruminations on lesbians, single moms, "feminists" and unhappily married straight women to be patronizing, with her constant asides on how spoiled she must appear to these unfortunate unblessed women.  I stopped wanting to read her self congratulatory rants many times.    That she felt more comfortable at McDonalds ("the people") than at Whole Foods (the Elite) was farcial without meaning to be. What self indulgence.    It's clear this person has never suffered a true tragedy or serious life experience, and that is why she takes every trivial experience so seriously as though it is worth much more than it is.   Maybe I was disappointed because my expectations were so high, because someone I respect recommended this book 
 My mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into Christianity.   I tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible. It was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book. In my personal opinion, the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on many occasions, this seems to be his only method of proving that the "Bible Code" does in fact, exist.   Not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in God or prophecies.' This gets very tiring. Drosnin does not provide solid evidence, no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms. The author kills his credibility on repeated occasions.   Overall, I found this to be an interesting read, but the author's arguements were not convincing enough for me. 
 This is the WORST book I have used in my study of finance.  It is full of errors and it is written in such a way that it is extremely hard to understand for an average student.  There are lots of calculations that are unexplained, assumtions are made that are never addressed,and it is just plain vague in virtually all subjects it discusses.  Buy  a different title if you actually want to learn about finance 
 Sappy, wordless music performed by an orchestra does NOT a classical piece make.  Paul McCartney has no idea of what constitutes serious "classical" music.  He doesn't understand orchestration or use of time or timbre.   I always get a kick out of pop stars who have never studied music, nor can they   read, write or understand musical composition, but still believe that they're qualified to write serious music.  Even with the Beatles, it was the more musically astute George Martin who arranged the strings on Eleanor Rigby and others.  Paul couldn't tell the difference between a French horn and a tuba.  Standing Stone sounds like bad elevator music -- good for a soundtrack to a movie, sort of like "The Family Way" music that Paul put together in the 60's.  The melodies are trite and the orchestration lacks depth.  If one does not understand how composition works, one's music can only have so musical depth.  Come to think of it, even Paul's silly love songs lack any real deep meaning.  This is pretentious crap and should have been titled Standing STONED.  
 Seemed like a good start, however pages 25 - 57 were missing and I had to return it, Am waiting for you to send it to me and I will be happy to review it the 
 Like I said in the title, this book is NO GOOD! It has no point and I think I got dumber as I read it. Goodbye 
 For the naive (like me) this is a comic book in disguise! Apparently if reading is a challenge, you can turn to "graphic novels".  What a disappointment. I settled down for a long winter evening's read and was done in a heartbeat. Sure, there is plenty of violence, but the plot is thinner than Kate Moss.  On the other hand, if you can't handle more than 10 words per page, maybe you will find the plot challenging. As for the surprise ending -- even a ten year old gets tired of seeing rabbits being pulled out of hats 
 This book was so boring I could barely stand it. In fact, I had to abandon ship halfway through. The main character is kind of interesting, as are the two kids, but the story itself is so slow-paced that the characters can't carry the book. I am a huge reader and I can count on one hand the times I've had to quit a book midway, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I found myself daydreaming everytime I tried to read it. The writing was over the top...the author sounds as if she's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story. Pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess, but don't believe them. One of the worst books I've ever read 
 I liked "All the Flowers are Dying" well enough to finish it, but I can't say I would highly recommend the book. The Scudder series has suffered from fatigue, although the last book was a big improvement over its immediate predecessors. This one will appeal to people like me who are hooked on the series, but I doubt that it would make a good introduction to Scudder for someone new. New York has changed, Scudder and the major characters have all aged, and Scudder's alcoholism has faded into the background. There's a loss of tension and angst in his life and in his relationships with others. Scudder's favorite cop has retired and there appears to be a replacement in a "college boy" who provides rather predictable turns to the plot. Serial killing seems out of place in the semi-ordered world of Matt Scudder and really belongs in the world of John Sanford's Lucas Davenport, who does this much better. The killer and his full story arc became obvious to me much too early in the book and there's a teaser subplot that's not resolved very satisfactorily. The serial killer is a bit of a cartoon and the victims (or presumed victim, in one case) don't come fully to life. Elaine, who has always been an interesting part of this series, is stuck with a thankless, underwritten part as a rather inert victim. In general, Block's stock company of characters seem tired, rather than "evolved" and it wouldn't hurt Block to move on to something else. Sadly, the last book in the "Burglar" series also was a disappointment. My advice to anyone who hasn't read Block is to start at the beginning--the books up until the mid-90s (when Block was cranking them out too quickly) are all worthwhile. For fans, this one is a way to get caught up with Scudder, but don't be surprised if it leaves you feeling like it's time for him to retire 
 I love Louis Prima, but this CD was disappointing. It arrived in the mail, and I put it in the stereo. The first song is "Just a  Gigolo". It's a classic. Unfortunately, half of this CD sounds like "Just a Gigolo" - the same beat, the same arrangements, and in one case, the identical vocal line. Every song on this CD seems to have the same rhythm which is very annoying. I wouldn't recommend this particular album 
 The book was to hard to follow and used words that the common person does not even know.  It seemed more like a novel to me and didn't help me understand much at all.  I would not suggest this book there are better ones out ther 
 I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds.  I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big.  I think that for a "small" backpack, that they are just too large.  Thank you 
 This is an ok book for new people, but it has several safty issues, and doesn't have the show cuts for many dogs, poodles. It also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs. There are better books out there 
 I am a flamenco guitarist who has played this art form on and off professionally for forty years.  Buleria is a highly technical flamenco song from Jerez, Spain.  This song does not appear on this album.  What does appear on this album are a series of Negro-Caribbean rumba beats with a Latin-pop style synthesizer playing over it.  Uber-tacky and having nothing to do with Buleria or the rest of flamenco that he is trading upon.    Rename the album Go Go Latin Low Rider Music and it would be more accurate, don't add yourself to the list of people who wish they could play or sing flamenco, but don't have a clue how 
 This book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security, global warming, etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells. The author contributes little to previous books on the subject, such as Rikin's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public. If anything, the book's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms. In doing so, the author comes up with some interesting case studies, but it's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of The Economist, which happens to be the author's employer. Moreover, there was little effort in integrating the various chapters. Overall, a very disapointing book. The author should stick to journalism 
 My first experience of William T.  I found the novel too reminiscent in technique of EL Doctorow's RAGTIME - the constant kaleidoscopic cutting between different sensibilities, interspersed with undisguised authorial commentary and narrative.  It works, but not as well - but then nor does Doctorow - as it did in their common parent, John Dos Passos.  Read his shorter (than his great trilogy, USA) novel, MANHATTAN TRANSFER to see the technique exploited to give a very real sense of an entire society at a moment in time.  The writing itself in EUROPE CENTRAL, dealing with a 'foreign' culture and age, is often too literal to really enthuse and affect and the background research seems 'dragged in', while the sense of the novel's overall design makes itself felt too evidently.  I will try more, but this is not the novel with which to begin the study of William T. Vollman 
 Great cover, enticing premise. I couldn't wait to read this book...BUT... Every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly. Let me add a couple more. Frannie grows up, decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she's going to do. What does her mother say? That's nice, dear. I trust you to make the right decision. Oh please!!! This is the 19th century after all! Then for good measure let's throw this one into the mix. After the indomitable Una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person, famous or not, that she comes into contact with...she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole. An oil well! You must be kidding! Of course, she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch.  I could go on and on. I finished every page of this book although I must say I skimmed through the last 100 pages. When I finished and my husband asked how it was, the only way I could think to describe it was SILLY 
 Saw a great review for this book in a local paper and thought it would be fun with great things to try.  Boy was I unimpressed.  On top of the fact that a lot of the "things to try" are bunched together with bad instructions, they are all copies  from mostly hand written material that is often just plain hard to read.  But the areas I couldn't read, I felt that I probably wasn't missing much 
 I used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months. While I thought it moisturized fine, I did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture. For the money I'd go get several tubes of the Neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell MUCH better.  As for "better than botox"  - buyer beware when you hear this line 
 This video takes the viewer back to the radical politics of the Sixties.  It is utterly biased and unredeemed by any balanced viewpoint and I found it suitable mainly for college courses in political rhetoric, radical communications history, and radical sociology and anthropology 
 Ordered this product Feb. 3rd and as of today (March 10th) I have not received the product or any information as to why.  I finally ordered this product elsewhere and received it in three days.  Still waiting to find out if I will receive a refund into my account for this product, since it was paid for in advance.       NOT IMPRESSE 
 I've always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn't wait to read Dear John. Well, there was no reason to rush. It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book.  I cannot wait for another Nicholas Sparks book, but only because I want to know that he hasn't lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck 
 There are moments in this inconsequential 2005 comedy when I can see a bright future for Jennifer Aniston's light comedic talents, even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure "Friends" persona. She plays Sarah Huttinger, a likeably insecure New York Times obituary writer going home to Pasadena to attend her younger sister Annie's wedding. Sarah is picture-pretty, 33 and engaged to a nice, unflappable guy named Jeff who accompanies her. At the same time, she's unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out-of-sorts with her well-to-do family. A ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family, her feisty, tart-tongued grandmother Katherine, who tells Sarah about her late mother's pre-wedding tryst in Mexico that gives rise to questions about Sarah's paternity.  All the domestic shenanigans that ensue would probably be enough to fill this comedy's blessedly brief 96-minute running time, but screenwriter Ted Griffin hangs it all on the idea that Sarah's family may have been the inspiration for the Robinsons in Charles Webb's 1963 novel, "The Graduate", which of course, is the basis of Mike Nichols' classic 1967 movie. The tie-in must have sounded like a creative idea on paper, but something happened on the way to the screen that has taken most of the comic invention out of it. In fact, there is a pervasive lethargy throughout this movie, and director Rob Reiner is unable to overcome it because Sarah's dilemma of choosing between adventure and predictability never feels that emotionally resonant. The dialogue never feels sharp, perceptive or funny enough to pull off the inevitable comparisons with the earlier film. Moreover, the story is set rather arbitrarily in 1997 to make the timelines make sense with the stars' ages.  Beyond Aniston, a strong cast has been set adrift. Playing Katherine like an even more embittered variation on Aurora Greenway, Shirley MacLaine crackles with aplomb as the possible inspiration for Mrs. Robinson, even when her lines are not as snappy as she thinks they are. As the aging but still magnetic Benjamin Braddock doppelganger, a high-tech mogul named Beau Burroughs, an overly sedate Kevin Costner barely registers in a smallish role. When he does, there is an insinuating, almost creepy quality in the way Beau's relationship with Sarah evolves. Until the end, Mark Ruffalo has little to do as Jeff but wait patiently for Sarah to resolve her personal dilemma. Richard Jenkins and Mena Suvari have even less time to make an impression in the underwritten roles of Sarah's passive father and bubbly sister, respectively. The 2006 DVD provides the original theatrical trailer (which gives away most of the plot) as its sole extra 
 There's something fundamentally wrong with the concept of a puzzle book for an application programming interface.  A book about an API should yield clarity, not puzzles 
 When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame. 
 Well intentioned but regrettably lacking in any real practical advise for those of us who suffer from this very dibilatating syndrome, "Freedom from Digestive Distress : Medicine-Free Relief from Heartburn, Gas, Bloating, and Irritable Bowel Syndrome" was a disappointing read. There is virtually no information on dealing with the embarrassing and often painful situations that are a part of our daily lives.  I was looking for answers and got very few:  What is the best approach for avoiding problems in a crowded movie theatre after a Mexican dinner?  How does one excuse oneself from a staff meeting without arousing suspicions? What is the best way to avoid blame for unpleasant odors in an elevator or a car?  How do I explain to my children that "Mommy's gas is involuntary"?  How will they learn that passing wind at the dinner table is NOT a joke?  These questions are left unanswered, and the reader is left feeling bloated 
 The book misrepresents the process of bereavement. There is no recovery, because grief is not an illness 
 I'm writing because I thought Fine's review was bad. I was interested in this movie because it has Jamie Gertz, who has proven to be a durable, dependable character actress.  Mr. Fine may or may not have talent but he is not spectacular.  Waspishness insults are passe and not becoming to a serious reviewer.  Ms. Gertz, by contrast, turns an abundance of personality to good account through her career.  I just don't know what "untalented" means in the context of this silly movie, but it was twenty years ago.  Is the insult intended to be forthe movie or for her whole career since?  kBad form and fuzzy thinking.  I think the movie is an attempt to imitate features of Flashdance: upbeat background music, meaningless but interesting visuals, skill display, romance,  people with aspirations surviving at a humble level.  Jamie Gertz is the "face" girl 
 I was disappointed in how small this book was, and that on every other page it was selling other books or even T-shirts!   I think it could have been a lot better.  The one chapter in The Girlfriend's Guide to the  Toddler Years that deals with bringing another baby into the house was more  insightful than this entire book 
 This book makes good points about how computer usability problems impact productivity.  The author argues that computers had a negative impact on productivity in the years 1973-1993, but misses the idea that these were  years of learning to incorporate computer technology deeply into business  processes.  Four year later, his argument that computers do not have a  dramatic and positive impact on economic productivity seems quaint 
 I recently bought this DVD and was really looking forward to seeing it. Halfway I stopped watching it. Disappointing 
 This fourth installment of Becky's trying tribulations is the worst. The qualty has plummeted from passable fun to total embarrassment. I don't understand how Kinsella's editor didn't draw the line (and the red pencil) at the litany of shopping expeditions. And her endless, excrutitating 'inner' reflections. Becky's exploits aren't amusing anymore. Her purchases on her honeymoon aren't wacky. They're bewildering. For a shopaholic with supposedly good taste, Becky buys the ugliest sounding things on her travels and then flogs them all on Ebay once home in England. And oh yes, then she discovers a long lost sister. That situation is about as believable as three designer wedding dresses and two weddings from the previous book. And then Bex and her sister wind up on a rock rescued by Tarquin in his personal helicopter. I am not making this up. It's all there in the book. And none of it is even remotely entertaining. And now God help us, Becky is pregnant. AARRGGGH!       
 This book is so outdated as to be laughable.  She talks about carbon paper and white-out!  Computers are treated as something for technologists.  She says Sidekick is the most popular software.  In fact it is no longer marketed or supported.  Memory typewriters are compared favorably to computers!  However, her Two-List Time Plan was worth the price of the book 
 A clock radio that you have to fumble for a remote to use....I don't think so.  I have the older models (CD & Clock Radio) and they are nice but the new model is irritating.    I also have the IPOD player and at least the volume controls are on the system.  I can't keep a system that I have to locate a remote to operate. 
 An easy read, this book is not necessarily accurate.  One example is in Lexa's claim that Turmeric (Curcuma longa) is the same as Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis).  It's obviously not.  The confusion probably stems from one of Goldenseal's other names, "Indian Turmeric", which is NOT the same as Turmeric the common spice.  Like many herbs, proper preparation is essential; goldenseal can paralyze the central nervous system and cause convulsions and respiratory failure in improper doses, so don't follow Lexa's advice to take it internally unless you are properly trained and/or medically supervised.  My suggestion to readers is to use this book for inspiration, but back up your research before working with the herbs by checking other sources for correspondences and toxicity.  Some herbs Lexa recommends for baths, ointments, incense, teas and the like are poisonous or carcinogenic.  Know what plants you are working with -- and how to do so safely -- from a reputable source before inhaling, wearing next to the skin, or ingesting them.  
 I was hoping this book would provide easy to ready clear answers to questions regarding Catholicism and the meaning of the mass.  To me it was like reading a sermon with too much explanation into the history of each part of the mass.  I was looking more for a quick reference and explanation of why certain things are done are certain times during the mass,,,kind of like a Catholic 101 or Catholic for Dummies book.   
 I haven't read a Picoult book in a while because her formula was bothering me but I saw this in the airport and decided it would be a easy yet entertaining read for the tedious 3 hour journey.  It was entertaining to the extent that I finished it. Unfortunately - it was still formulaic and completely predictable.  Elements that I liked:   - Rape is very rarely easy to sort out and date rape cases involving drugs, ex-boyfriends and alcohol are especially difficult. The confusion and obfuscation that Picoult writes (whether that was her intention or just poor writing) surrounding the issue can be representative of an actual rape.    - Teenagers are notoriously melodramatic and self pitying and Trixie, though a little over the top, seemed like a typical teenager... the reaction of other students at her school to the rape and Trixie also seem plausible.   - I liked the graphic novel. The melodramatic aspects are typical of the genre and it was a great way to try and illustrate Daniel. The hidden word bit - hokey.   - I liked learning about the native cultures in Alaska. I would like to read a whole book that takes place there and explores the themes though maybe not by Picoult.   - I liked the idiot's guide to Dante that was incorporated into the book.  Things I didn't like:   - Picoult tries to incorporate too much into this book and thus wasn't able to fully develop it all. Though I liked the native Alaskan bit, it was too jumbled and it didn't really add to the plot. Like another reviewer I wasn't left with the impression that Daniel's haunted past resurfaced. I was expecting a lot more. Murder? That's too much to add to this already overburdened plot.   We lose threads here and there like Daniel's career and the wife's affair - he just disappears after his admission. Cutting is a very real phenomena for many young women and Jodi doesn't explain or develop it.  I don't know that it was at all believable. Could the myopic Trixie have had the wherewithal to make it to Alaska when she could barely see beyond her own break-up and tried to commit suicide multiple times?  The cop, the DNA analyst, the lawyers, the parents, the twist - I've seen them all before in Jodi's other books... it's part of her formula.  I wonder what would happen if Jodi spent maybe three or four years researching a novel and devoting time to its plot. She could excel in character development and careful analysis of difficult topics. I feel like this novel writing machine is doing herself, her readers and literature a disservice 
 I could give a long winded review on how bad this album is, but let me just say this... Radiohead is one of the few bands that I fell for all the hype about.  What an idiot I was, I bought this cd and listened to it about 20 times trying to figure out what it was that I was missing.  I finally came to the conclusion that the masses are indeed stupid if this is supposed to be the new alternative or cutting edge or whatever.  The song creep is probably one of the worst rock songs of all time and the rest of the album is totally unmemorable.  Garbage folks that is all this amounts to.  The most overated band of all time perhaps? Oh by the way before everybody gets mad and assumes I didn't give any of their other so-called experimental releases a chance, let me say... it ahas all been done before.  You just have to dig a little deeper than MTV and Rolling Stone magazine to find it.  Don't believe the hype! 
 It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her 
 I decided to buy this book instead of borrowing from the library because of the pretty colorful pictures it has. However, I regret spending $100 on this book because the text is poorly orgnanized. Although some chapters are written well, you will see content are scrambled within some chapters making it hard to take notes. There are also errors like they mentioned that Th cell help cellular response, but they ever tell you how. The activation gate and inactivation gate mentioned in the neuron chapters are confusing. The mentioned it on the text, but they don't show it on the pictures.   I need to admit that their animation, tutorial in their web site are awesome.   I would recommed the campbell book instead 
 This is a book by someone who obviously loves corvids but is unequipped for realizing the task she set herself.  The "fabulous" part of the book deals with old world history in two sentences, spending the rest of the space on folksy retellings of stories from Native American traditions.  The "natural" part of the history is anecdotal, sentimentalized and inadequate.  Other works serve far better for each of this one's stated purposes 
 I have been very disappointed in this 5th Cape Light Novel. It is slow and boring. I am usually a VERY fast reader but it has taken me 4 weeks and I am still not finished with this one! I loved the first 4 books in this series but I think it is time  to finish the series and be done with it. James is not a very interesting character and NOT hero material. While I have been wondering at Leigh's past, there hasn't been enough mystery to capture my attention for very long. Emily and Dan's marriage plans are boring also. About the only interesting thing that has happened yet is Jessica and Sam's child issues. I have found myself skipping parts and that says a lot for this book. Overall, the first 4 books in this series deserve 5 stars and this one....well...you should quit while you're ahead. 
 Superficial, scattered with an odd smattering of references, this is one of the worst biographies that I have ever read. Ted Hughes deserves better 
 "This songbook uses a unique system ... The system may seem tricky at first, but  a lot of people find it works really well once they get the hang of it." I found it to be quite "tricky" and didn't have the patience/skill to "get the hang of it." I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but an accomplished musician 
 When I opened the product, the sheets really were soft. But when you're laying on them, they aren't very comfortable.  I wouldn't buy another set again. But they were cheap, so not a horrible buy 
 Crudely written. A negative hero deserves better and Wharton has written some fine books. Sadly, not this one. 
 Another mewling conservative decrying the present state of American education and calling for a return of the Greek and Latin classics. All the usual suspects are included: Bill Clinton, multiculturalism, etc. It's less a call for a return to the basics than a whining political screed and written with all the Asiatic tinsel of a Bill Buckley, who wrote the foreword and gave the book his blessing. There is much good being done in public education, and the classics are not being ignored. It's just that education--and a classical education at that--is no longer the exclusive right of a privileged caste, which is what really bothers these people 
 I am halfway through the subject book (Gerald Green's "East and West"). I have found several historical discrepancies and I'm wondering how many there are that I don't know about.  1. Mr. Green refered  to Camp Pendleton, twice in the timeframe of 1941. The US governement did  not buy the land for Camp Pendleton until March of 1942. 2. He refers to  Japan's Imperial Marines. Japan did not have marines. They had a Special  Naval Landing force often called marines by US troops, but that is not what  they were. 3. He refers to a Japanese major's rank insignia as  "leaves". This one I'll have to look up, but I don't believe  Japan used the same type of rank insignia as the US. Has anyone else  complained about authors blowing it like this ? I think it casts doubt on  the credibility of his work. Can you comment as well ? Thank You, Lee Ras 
 Reading through John Irving's "The Cider House Rules," I found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. In obtaining a bachelor's degree in English, I had to read a lot of books. Among them were many books that I did not like, but never before had I read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety.   Every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. People become pregnant, have abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. This goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. The book doesn't flow naturally, you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the puppet master. There are just so many coincidences, so many old friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly connected to eachother. I don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the Eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. It's as though the author is God, and the characters completely lack free will.  And then there's the "protagonist," Homer Wells. I put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story, Homer Wells barely does anything in the story. He barely even speaks during the story. He is virtually a non-character, devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. The scenes that do not involve Homer Wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book, are without fail the most interesting scenes. I think that the real protagonist of the book is Dr. Larch, but even Melony seems more real than Homer does.   The story is very long and rambling. Subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. Minor characters keep popping into the story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. Conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with Debra Pettigrew).   After such a rambling, at times rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. It is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people conveniently dying). To spoil the plot just a little, Homer Wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. I personally am pro-choice as well, but I found that Homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters 
 quindlen's advice here is certainly pretty sensible stuff, though i think any reasonably intelligent person could have come up with something just as good.  my real beef is with the price of the book in comparison to what you get.  the book is only 64 pages long and half of those pages are pictures with no text anywhere on the page.  so, being charged $12.95 for a 32 page book, and a pretty small one at that, strikes me as beyond ludicrous, even if the content is pretty good.  i'm just glad i checked it out from the library instead of buying it 
 I've been had is all I can say, after reading other reviews I really thought this would be an interesting, exciting movie. Instead, the story is lame, the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so NOT scary or at least gripping. I watched the whole thing as I thought maybe I am missing something, but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end. Sorry guys, but this is nowhere near, Audition, Tale of two Sisters or even Whispering Corridors 
 The hubris of Harper Collins has to be experienced to be believed. In order to learn this for yourself, you may choose to do as I have done:   First, email and request the answer key. When you obtain no response--after first emailing twice more--ring up the publisher. Several efforts will be made to lose your call, but with persistence you may find yourself speaking with what in publishing passes for an "actual person."   This voice will tell you that the answer key--necessary for this workbook to have any value whatever--is available exclusively to educators.   Next, attempt to bypass this block by informing the voice that you are an independent learner. The voice will inform you that "we don't really recommend independent study of Latin. Frankly, it is a complex language, and its study is an endeavour best left to those under the guidance of formal instruction."   Next, disagree with the voice, and begin to explain the value of independent study and personal learning and development. This will give the voice the opportunity to cut across you and explain that the purpose of textbook publishing is not to support learning, but to support Education. (The capital "E" is my own embellishment, but you will be able to hear it pronounced in the voice, as was I).   Choosing to ignore this distasteful--if predictable--commodification of knowledge, you should inquire as to whether you might provide a copy of your receipt, proving that you have purchased the workbook at full price (not a shamelessly used copy, for which the publisher receives bupkis). Rather than even attempting to deny your analysis, the voice will simply say that they are not set up to verify purchases.   You must then inform the voice that you will be returning the book. They will inform you that you have written in the book, so you will likely have to keep it. You will inform the voice that you do not deface books, and that you wrote your answers on separate paper. The voice will tell you that you started to use the book, so you have no right to return it.  At this stage, you may select from any expletive you particularly fancy, and use it in the Imperative, before hanging up the phone and returning this useless-in-the-absence-of-a-key garbage.   ---  And, quite frankly, I would probably use Cambridge Latin rather that Wheelock, given that Cambridge is more than willing to provide any interested learner with the requisite resources.   
 If you enjoy being dizzy (and I don't mean with delight or excitement) then this is the book for you. It constantly is hopping you backwards and forward in time, not only that, but you are constantly hit by a slew of new characters (all peripheral and mostly unimportant) aunts, uncles, friends, sons, dentists, doctors insurance sales men...MAKE IT STOP! Enough is enough. I read this book and it would end up irritating me to the point of putting it down. I like an interesting and complex plot line as well as the next person, however, this seems self serving and written just to show you how damn clever Mr. Straub is and how stupid you the reader are for being unable, or unwilling, to follow along with this meandering and endless tale.  I normally like most things but I really hate this.  Very disappointed 
 I seen this movie on saturday the 24 2002. This movie is soo good by the acting. There's pretty alot of action in this flick and pretty funny too. patrick swanye play a good role with his kids. They deathly need a dvd version of this movie I want it soo bad it would be a better picture. They should been create this movie on dvd too bad it's not on dvd yet. maybe this year or next year to be on dvd cause the dvd makers need to bring this out fast it's a real good movie maybe someday i have on dvd when it come out I be real sice 
 This book was a major disappointment. It was my first excusion into chick lit and I can safely say I've read enough. The first rule of a good story is that it should make the reader care about the central characters, and I didn't. Or I should say I despised Natalie Miller, found her self-absorbed and annoying, and would not root for her in any instance. I liked her best friend Babs much more, and she is sketched at an arm's distance. Natalie is anorexic, insecure, disloyal, unsure of any decision she makes and totally worthless as a friend. We learn only halfway through the book that she has an eating disorder; which the author can't decide is a central plot twist or not. Natalie is surrounded by men and admirers that all seem to be missing something, but they are all pining over her in one shape or another (Andy, Robbie, Chris, Simon...) and it all seems implausaible given the short shrift she begins that book with (Saul). The story twists are totally predictable, the seductions seem implausible, and she can't seem to commit to any feelings or to one person. She hasn't a clue that Chris is using her, thought it's drawn as plain as day. I wouldn't have her as a friend, and I did not care a fig for what became of her. I bailed out 3/4 into the book and I am sorry I wasted that much time.   And why is Natalie always "bleating" or "squeaking" her responses? ("'I don't' I bleated" or "'I can't' I squeaked.") There must be 2-3 bleats or squeaks per page and they drove me crazy. Then all the other characters start bleating too. Lack of originality and trying too hard to be funny, and failing. This book fell flatter than a ballet slipper.  
 I believe that life is too short and books that really deserve to be read too plentiful (not to mention movies worth watching, games worth playing, ...) for anyone to spend more than five minutes on this book. It's amazing how marketing can help sell such fluffy material. Any time, I recommend "If You Want to Write" by Brenda Ueland instead 
 I couldn't find a lower star than 1 so I had to give it a one. Tried charging it up a few times but couldn't get more than 1/2 hour playback time. (music playback-no game playback) It's just a nice attachment for gripping.... Don't waste your money here 
 The author makes excellent points about the wind of pompous, meaningless jargon and deceptive spin that has swept through government, business and academia.  I personally trudged through a lot of this muck in the social "sciences" and share the author's concern for the erosion of the language.  We are losing our ability (or is it will?) to say what we mean in a way that is easy to understand and worth the reader's time.     Chapter 1 should be digested by everyone whose job requires them to write or speak.  In the beginning I thought the book was a 4; by page 58 I was thinking 3 stars; and by chapter 3 it was in freefall.  His own writing bogs down in muddy thinking and poorly chosen examples.  I lost sight of his sails as he drifted off point and disappeared in a fog of philosophical opportunism.   I still recommend chapter 1, but get it from your library.  It's not worth the money.  
 It is not giving way the ending of this movie to say that the writer seems to have forgeting the plot of movie half way through and started writing a differant one.   Personally I can not blame him. Throw in some un funny anti and anti sementic jokes, (note I am the most un pc person in world so if I am put off it says somthing)  and an apperance by larry king, and and you have everything wrong with american movie making.   Please note- Jon Lovitts character in the critic word have great time with this high budget turke 
 As an ardent fan of Nancy Wilson for 43 years, I've always looked forward to each of her new recordings. As noted elsewhere on this site, I feel her Grammy winning RSVP was probably her best recording ever. Period. Turned to Blue? I'm amazed at how much her voice has deteriotated in just three years. Time to hang up the vocal chords, Nancy 
 Leslie Feinberg has written a well put together synthesis ofinteresting theories, some of which are self-generated. TRANSGENDERWARRIORS tells a story of human history as a tale of androgeny in which all men/women acted in concert and cooperation to solve all of life's problems until the rise of capitalism and patriarchy. When these two "evils" arose, they divided people against themselves by class and gender. Feinberg shows a smattering of knowledge of history but much of her book is feminist and genderist rhetoric. It is also a personal cry of outrage at how many people still treat those who are different and those who lack power. As a work of history it appears to fall short. As a personal statement, as an expression of FEELING of the author's pain and longing for justice it hits the mark.  As the webmaster of a transgender website I looked forward to reading the book. I found it interesting more from a human point of view than from a particularistic self-interest group view. The biographical sections of the book were moving. I found Feinberg's "solutions" to the social problems of alternate lifestyle people somewhat sophmoric.   EN 
 Bryson is certainly witty. But any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author's snotty and obnoxious tone. I can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits; there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self-image. What a whining, immature, mean jerk. And by the way, there's a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book. 
 Why? This is a total waste of time and money on Disney's part. They just don't have that "magic" that they had in the 90's. I hope something happens because some of the animated movies are losing credibility. JMHO  
 I received a 12-piece placesetting of these dishes for our wedding. After using the dishes for about six months, cracks have appeared in the glazing and edges have chipped/flaked off bowls and plates. The dishes have not been used extensively, and it appears that even light "everyday" use by two people is too much for them. Lenox recommends using low temperature dishwasher setting and low temperature microwave use. Even following those instructions, our dishes have cracked and chipped. When I called Lenox to complain, they told me they would have to send a formal letter of authroization, at which time I would be asked to mail them the damaged dishes (10 dinner plates, nine bowls and one salad plate). One of their quality control specialists would examine the dishes and call me back I would not recommend this line from Lenox. I am awaiting the authorization letter, but overall, I am very disappointed in this product and the company that buit its reputation on quality and high standards. I would not recommend these dishes.   
 I saw this a few nights ago on regular late night tv, so maybe it was edited to death and I missed all the interesting parts???? All I know is that it seemed highly unbelievable... Spoilers follow....(...why does the rapist just walk in her front door...would you leave your door unlocked if you had just been attacked and the rapist had your driver's license?!!) Anyways...I couldn't get past that part through the whole movie, so maybe that's what made me hate it. I do have to give kudos to Farah Fawcett though, her acting was excellent and seemed very genuine...maybe she has been through some similar trauma in real life? 
 Too bad that the last of the Ripley books was a bit of a let-down.  A great set up and interesting premise, the book is marred by its poor resolution.  What potential - two vulgar Americans who become Ripley's neighbors with a hidden agenda...the "cat and mouse" of this book should have been great, but sadly it falls short.  In my opinion, Ripley's Game is the best of the Ripley sequels - this one doesn't even come close.. 
 The other review that stated you could write your thoughts in your own journal is correct.  This is quite an expensive badly put together "writing tablet".  While the idea of getting to the source of pain is good - it shouldn't cost as much as it did for something you can do on your own. This really isn't very helpful and seems like a creative way for someone to take advantage of people in pain 
 Other than Heavy Metal Drummer, this album is totally mediocre. This album is perhaps the most overated, overhyped alternative album of all time. I do not see what all the fuss was about. I guess that sums up Wilco for me in general. I could not name another song on this album because none of the other tracks are worth remembering. Download Heavy Metal Drummer off a paysite and skip this album at all costs 
 My seat is BRAND NEW and I love it, but it has already quick working. I've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly. It won't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes. VERY DISAPPOINTED. 
 I am so sorry that I bought this book.  It is unfortunate that you do not have a Penguin or Everyman's Library edition.  First of all the book is too large to read in bed.  Secondly, whoever did the proofreading should be fired.  There are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading.  If the postage were not so expensive from Israel, I would return the book to Amazon 
 The themes in this story were SO repetitive - I get it already! And there were so many details, they bogged the story down. I found myself skimming in lots of places, and don't feel like I missed anything. 
 This CD isn't all that bad, but I wouldn't get another of theirs. They have sold out shows and have become quite popular. Their CD was recommended to me by someone who works at concerts and has been to several of their shows and is well-rounded in both Scottish and Irish bands. This is a good band if you like Irish rock, but the band I recommend for Irish music is DEFFINATLY Flogging Molly. They have more Irish based music and have an assortment of songs that any Irish fan is sure to find favor in. For now, it's still Flogging Molly all the way 
  	The book Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage is about the economy and the impact one scientist had on the world with his predictions.  Hubbert's theory stated that in the early 1970's oil production would reach its highest level. He was doubted my many scientists, but when it came true scientists used it to look at what the future holds for oil production. It is expected to hit this decade at some point. This book describes the origin of oil and development over the many years. It also describes several different oil fields and the prosperity of them, and the different types of techniques and bits used to find oils by scientists. Each scientist has different methods of finding the oil fields, and they use data sets to record the sites and sizes of them. It provides an overview of what the future holds for oil production, and what different kinds of energy we can resort too if needed to avoid the economic troubles lying ahead. 	I thought this book was overall pretty boring. I wasn't  entertained or hooked on it, and it didn't make me want to keep reading in the end. I found it very confusing most of the time, and it had a lot of information to try to digest all at once, such as numbers and equations. It wasn't the kind of book I really get indulged in, and want to read more of, or cant put down.  	I would recommend this book to those who like to read books about our economy and what's going on in different industries. This book is easier to read for adults, as it contains advanced material that could confuse younger children. For those who enjoy reading advanced books about our economy or oil, this is an excellent book. 
 I remember seeing this film as a kid and thinking to myself, maybe when I'm older I'll understand the signifigance of this movie. But 29 years later I'm even more confused as to why this film was made.   "King of Marvin Gardens" took me a record-breaking four sittings to watch because I kept falling asleep. Don't get me wrong. I appreciate a thoughtful, well-written, well-acted human interest story--but where was the human interest in this flick?? Why am I supposed to be interested in these characters?? Interesting characters don't have to be nice and heroic, but they certainly have to be compelling!   I think after the tremendous success of "Five Easy Pieces" (deservedly so), that genre of anti-story must have been all the vogue in cinema during the mid-1970s. With the exception of the last 10 minutes you have an absolutely flatliner of a film here.  Movies of that period, like "Fat City" and "Scarecrow" do a much more effective job of conveying the dire banality of real life.  Although the packaging and  presentation for the "King of Marvin Garden" DVD was flawless 
 Sorry guys, I looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media.  The graphics of the book are truly beautiful.  The recipes however, hmmm,  try again.  I followed a simple recipe for Apple Crisp and got a bad result.  I now go to respected standard cookbooks for my Apple Crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great.  Really people, the recipes are NOT the stuff of greatness.  Graphics? Great. Photography? Great?  Recipes? You have got to be kidding 
 I am taking my family to Italy this year and wanted to know the basics like "where is...." "how much...." "do you speak English?" etc.  The first five chapters were very good but by chapter six, they were concentrating on "do you want beer or wine at your place or mine...."  This theme continued throughout the remainder of the 16 chapters.  I would have prefered to order soda or tea at a restaurant or cafe.  With all this talk about beer and wine, they never once mentioned how to find a bathroom.  Their learning style was fine, but I would have preferred the "family version" 
 I watched as much as I could stand on PBS before concluding this was not a classic 19th century novel unknown to me but a poor recent imitation, and came online to verify that.  Anyone who is enjoying watching this has presumably never seen anything based on a really good novel, like those by Dickens, Dumas, or even Wilkie Collins. What ****!  I refuse to waste my time even to see it through to the end.  This is only for people in the current generation raised to observe frequent violence rather than intelligent plot and conversation.  It is not terrible, but not worth watching if you have anything at all worth doinng with your time 
 Where did they get the reviews on the cover of this book? The resemble nothing I found in reading this.    One of the first rules of writing is "show- don't tell" Danielle Steel took the low road in writing this simple tale. The plot is extremely weak and the way it is told... is well "told".  The feelings and inner thoughts of the characters are told to us, not shown. The character are told to the reader to be lonely, sad, etc. Instead of being in positions that relect that state and therefore allow the reader to conclude that. It is very amateurishly written. I am afraid she was simply trying to pump out another book, and rest on her laurels from the past. tsk tsk tsk..... lazy 
 Hi, My dad is deaf and he is a hard core Chicago Bear fan. I thought this DVD would make an excellent gift for my father. I am hoping that this DVD has subtitles or captioning for the hearing impaired in it so my dad would not miss any narrative and historical information of those football players. 
 While the subjects chosen as warriors are intriguing, the stories are somewhat superficial and not tersely edited, but somewhat rambling. I had expected a lot more.....disappointing 
 This story line is probably one you've already read by another author, and it's very easy to tell how the book will end.  The details of the book are original, and it does move along and hold your interest, but it's a repeat of a relationship between two people.  I was actually surprised that Ms. Steel would go down this road, and not offer something more original.  
 Micheal Dell comes off as a self promoting marketing blow hard and it is not worth the read.  [... 
 The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money 
 It's great that Dr. Weil recommends that we get fresh air, exercise, eat lots of vegetables, avoid fast food hamburgers,  breathe and think positive healing thoughts.  But that's the extent of his good advice.  He also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out.  "The Whole Soy Story" by Kaayla Daniel and "The Fluoride Deception" by Chris Bryson.  Between soy and fluoride you'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks (+ or -) and that doesn't bring optimum health.      
 Put any decent music on and my little girl is on her feet dancing to the max until her legs get tired. I borrowed this CD from a neighbor who hated it and was going to toss it out. Laffy Taffy sounds like some third rate song put out as background music to a pre-school Sesame-Street-style rant produced by an amateur high-school class learning filmmaking. My girl started laughing probably because she didn't recognize this as real music.  Most of the other tracks on this CD are equally as deficient; the CD actually gets progressively worse the further into it you listen. It almost appears that the lack of depth in instrumentation primarily is due to the fact that these four "gentlemen" can barely play any instruments and could not afford to hire any session musicians to make the recording.  No matter -- they capture the classic image of gangsta to a "T" with the angry "bad" look, the bling bling, and the $100 bills. Sadly, this album is so pathetic that the gold probably is not real gold - likely brass. The cash you see on the album cover likely didn't come from musical success -- probably either borrowed, counterfeit, or proceeds from the sale of drugs :)  . And perhaps these guys should go back to Atlanta to street hustling or whatever criminal activity they occupied their time with before this ill-advised foray into the music industry.  In short, D4L, "don't quit your day job" 
 I bought this book aiming to gain indepth understanding of VPN technology, but I was disappointed. The key chapter 4, for example, try to explain tunnel concept left and right, but it mixed the general encapsulation and tunnel, and the verbose wording didn't make it any clear. Using tcpdump trace to explain some of the field is both a blessing and curse, depending on how you look at it - I think the book is sort of strong in specific details but weak in overall conceptual pictures - however most of those details have been better documented in the RFCs.   Another example - when talking about generic tunnel skeleton using FreeBSD as example (ch 4.8), where some code snippets are presented, I feel some background and detailed illustration of flow/drawing is necessary to clear up the concept and why it correlates prevoius sections, but none given.    It may sound a bit harsh: though the author try to emulate Rich Steven's style and dedicate the book to him, but it is hard for me to say the end product can really live up to Steven's standard. 
 We live in a house on a lake but just bought a St. Louis apartment for weekends, and this book sounded perfect for what I want. I got it home and was  so  disappointed. I don't know know where the "500 solutions for living" are.  This is a pretty picture book but it doesn't have much to say. More than a handful of words would have been nice. Don't buy this 
 This book is a perfect introduction to the wealth of hiking possibilities in patagonia - many of them are still significantly under-used and of equal calibre to the more famous routes. The general information sections are quite good, and give a good feel for what conditions are like both trekking and travelling in general; a good purchase for planning your trip. Where the book falls down is on the actual trekking notes, which are consistently inaccurate, obscenely outdated and sometimes quite misleading (see other reviews). On this front, Cerro Electrico is not safe - however Cerro Electrico Oeste is safely climbable without mountaineering equipment (although crampons are a nice idea) and gives mind-blowing views of the rear of Fitzroy - I think this might be what the author actually had in mind.  The best use of this book is as an introduction/inspiration, then get hold of decent military maps (plentiful in santiago and buenos aires) and local advice (abundant) and go from there. Given that many of the treks require some degree of independence and judgement (especially in snow-bound regions), pretty much any information should be taken with a grain of salt and certainly should be double-checked independantly or at worst against common sense. It is a pity no better alternative exists, but the general information is good and if prepared, leave the fun of route-finding up to yourself 
 Unlike the rest of the reviews here, this one isn't exactly a glowing recommendation.  I found most of the principles in the story completely out of character with their established personalities.  In the series, you were  left with the impression that Picard was extremely upset with Ro Laren's  betrayal, yet in the book, it's hardly even mentioned at all.  Another  point, the author does a good job of describing federation prisoners  suffering thoroughly at the hands of the Jem Hadar and Cardassians while  doing slave labor, while the main character completely forgets them at the  end to start his own life, no longer caring about his suffering comrades  who are still prisoners.  He even forgets about his best friend who helped  him get through the tough times.  No, I was completely let down.  The noble  Picard acting like the brash young Captain Kirk threw me for a loop also 
 This tripe was horrible. The only reason i gave it 1 star is because of the bus wreck that was very gory. Besides that, and when the boy scout zombies attack, I fast forwarded thru the entire movie. Even the nudity was horrible. If all other movies on earth are destroyed and TV is abolished, you should STILL not watch this film!!!! 
 This cd is funny once in awhile. Listening to once a week is deadly. Larry is funny but then ruins his jokes by saying I dont care who you are, thats funny or the every annoying and over exposed GIT R DONE!!!!!!!!!!!! Very sick jokes about incest. 
 This movie is a disappointment considering it was made at a time when so many of the survivors were still alive and recently freed from Russian captivity.  The film covers the experiences of a veteran German officer assigned as an advisor to a Rumanian Army Corps on the eve of the Stalingrad encirclement.  The film does not go into any kind of depth either in terms of character development or story line to explain the importance and tragedy of Stalingrad.  One must think that it even disappointed it's original German viewers of the 1950's who probably desired some kind of explanation for the disaster of Stalingrad and the Nazi era.   As an anti-war film this film is a failure; as a shoot 'em up action war film it is droll.  All in all this is less satisfying than a made for TV movie of the same period.    
 They call it "visual therapy" but they use mostly words to describe the types of worerobes. If you don't know your style yet, reading this book won't help you much. If you know your style already, you will know all the common sense already in this book. I usually finish a book I startes. This one, I kept thinking I wasted my money and time 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 I've taken this particular CD for a spin on a couple of runs, and I was so uninspired, I turned it off.  The soldiers (?) on the CD had be chided a number of times for not sounding off, not exactly the most motivated group that was being recorded so they could sell a CD 
 Not a single insight. Not a single "aha". Go read something else 
 If you are Caucasian, a man, and have money, this book is not for you.  Page after page is minorities and woman crying, sobbing etc etc about how bad they have it and whose fault it is.  If women and minorities hate Caucasian men with money, why is there one voted in every 4 years.  Quit crying and vote 
 Dreck conjured from the dimwitted semi-erotic fantasies of a chinless anemic Englishman resting on laurels from 20 years past. Borderline child porn with delusions of grandeur and pretensions of meaningfulness 
 YO this album can be described in the simplest term - Garbage 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 As for digital technology, monster cable has once again ruined the marketplace by greatly over estimating what their products are worth.  The great difference with the digital output/inpt devices compared to analog is simple.  If the digital signal reaches the device it needs to it can't be any more or less clear.  Because your digital signal is comprised of "0's" and "1's" if you can see your TV or hear the music then what ever cable you use works-  There is no distortation across digital signals, so don't pay the extra money- In fact you shouldn't need to spend more than around $30-50.  
 Steven Pinker lost me as a buyer of his thesis with the very second sentence of his book:   "For you and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability: we can shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision".  It you take that for granted, Pinker's book will seem compelling and not especially controversial. Steven Pinker clearly takes it for granted, perhaps because he can't conceive of how we could possibly communicate effectively and coherently if it were not true.   Consider the following, which I think perfectly encapsulates the world view Pinker can't conceive of, by Ogden Nash:  Caught in a mesh of living veins, In cell of padded bone, He loneliest is when he pretends That he is not alone.  We'd free the incarcerate race of man That such a doom endures Could only you unlock my skull, Or I creep into yours.  To my way of thinking, it is the very fact that we *can't* "shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision" - or with any reliable certainty at all, that describes the human condition. The frisson created by precisely that ambiguity underpins all communication; it is the source of irony, tragedy, comedy, invention and imagination. Any theory of language which denies that fundamental contingency of human communication (as this one does) is going to have to prove it, and displacing that onus is a heavy task indeed.  Pinker's psycho-linguistics makes precisely that denial, by holding that all human communication - every language - shares an inate, evolutionary programmed Universal Grammar, precisely because Pinker can't conceive how else human communication could be possible.  I'm no academic, and certainly I have no background in linguistics. Given that this theory - which is from the same tradition as Noam Chomsky's - has been the ascendancy amongst academic linguistics for the best part of the last thirty years, Steven Pinker being one of the leading "normal scientists" within the paradigm (if I should be so bold as to use that word), and that The Language Instinct is considered fairly widely to be his magnum opus, I was expecting to have my naive relativistic assumptions carefully and systematically dissected, then annihilated, one by one.  So imagine my surprise to find that in the place of carefully drawn arguments and compelling statistical data, one finds a tissue of anecdotal arguments carefully selected to fit the theory, arguments from authority ("Chomsky is one of the ten most cited writers in all of the humanities"), dubious suppositions in place of statistical data (the "it is difficult to imagine the following grammatical construction being used" sort of thing),  begged questions, non sequiturs, and Roger Penrose-style irrelevant scientific waffle - especially as regards evolution - and a decided absence of any consideration of competing theories of linguistics - and straw men versions of those which do rate a mentioned.   In short, Steven Pinker employs just about every illegitimate arguing technique in the book. His theory completely fails to account for metaphor (metaphor is barely mentioned in the book), nor the incremental development of language, the evolution of different languages with different grammars and vocabularies. At times Pinker is forced to argue that the grammar of our language is sometimes different from the words we actually speak and write, containing unspoken "inaudible symbols" representing a word or phrase which has been moved elsewhere in the sentence, so the sentence "The car was put in the garage", according to Pinker's Universal Grammar should technically be rendered as: "was put the car in the garage", and the construction we use can only be explained by movement of "The car" and the insertion in its place of an inaudible "trace":  "[The car] was put [trace] in the garage".  Now, again I am no technical linguist, but this has all the hallmarks of pure bull manure to me.  Finally, Pinker is at pains to point out that Universal Grammar is only ever applicable to oral language: written language didn't arise for centuries after oral grammar "evolved" as a phenotype.  But this hardly helps Pinker, since (as he himself points out, with reference to a transcript of the Watergate Tapes) when people talk in ordinary conversation they almost *never* use complete grammatical sentences: they interrupt themselves, they rely on physical gestures, they break off in mid stream and start a new thought, they don't punctuate (there's no unequivocal punctuation in spoken English), all the time.   As is fashionable amongst the "reductivist" and "evolutionary" set these days (a set I would otherwise, in general terms, consider myself in agreement with), relativist arguments are scorned. But Pinker's paradigm implies that, provided we are competent in constructing our own sentences, we should all understand each other perfectly, all the time: there should be no ambiguity; no room for miscontrual; no possibility for evolution in ideas or language. It is difficult to see how anyone could believe such a thing. But neither the structure of language and grammar nor its practical use needs to be perfect for effective communication *at some level* to be possible, and surely that is all that is needed. The beauty of the contingent view of language, which Pinker seems unable to appreciate, is how it can account for the missed margin of communication which might explain the everyday cultural and interpretative problems we all face, and the figurative and metaphorical power we all find at our disposal. Ogden Nash's dilemma is our dilemma, however much Steven Pinker might wish it were otherwise.  An earlier reviewer has mentioned Geoffrey Sampson's "the Language Instinct Debate" as a compelling antidote to Pinker's world view. Having recently read it (on the strength of that recommendation), I would firmly agree. In perhaps an ill-advisedly grumpy tone, Sampson - whose position at the University of Sussex inevitably means his academic profile is lower than Pinker's or Chomsky's - systematically and convincingly annihilates many of the arguments (such as they are) in Pinker's work.

 The main character came across as gay to me too. This movie is in no way realistic. The other reviewer is right about everything. It's a really cheap movie made by amateurs using plastic toy guns, the actors jerk the guns to make them look like they have a kick. The "martial arts" in the movie are weak and sloppy, there's no way that crap would actually work in real life. I don't even know why I bothered to watch the whole thing, I guess I just found the stupidity amusing. The cover makes it look like it would be a cool movie, unfortunately that's the only thing they put much effort into. I rented it from Block Buster too, they need to burn it. This movie looks like some kind of a high school project or something, like they had to make a movie to pass drama class 
 From its boring title to its cast of cliched southern rednecks, the Empty Chair disappoints from the very beginning.  The storyline about a teen killer/kidnapper obsessed with insects is interesting, but the story quickly dissolves into a half-baked tale of southern intrigue that never offers any excitement.  Deaver tried to save the book by pulling about a dozen rabbits out of a hat near the end of the novel, but many of these surprises and plot twists make no sense at all, and after the third or fourth one, the reader just gets tired of the whole thing.  Deaver also tries to wrap up every plot conflict with a neat little bow at the end, but he leaves out most of the explanations which only leaves readers scratching their heads and wondering what happened.  Try the earlier books in this series, both of which were far better reads 
 Hate this griddle. Everything sticks, and has done since I bought it. I have tried everything I can think of to get it to work, without success. It does not heat evenly, and is the worst appliance I have ever bought. I plan to return it 
 Don't buy this oven. Wait until the next generation comes out. I read the reviews and the guy who said it's of low quality is correct. This should be an under-$100 unit.  It rattles, the temperature is off by at least 50 degrees and  the door gap grows as it heats up. The thermostat is a cheap bimetal, not bulb, type. The temp setting of 300 degrees is actually 400 plus inside. I did not buy this at Amazon and it is going back 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 I purchased this book as part of a required reading for my high school honors geometry course. It is perhaps the most utterly boring and fanatical piece of fiction I have ever read. Not only is the book completely devoid of plot, it is lacking in all aspects of what a true work of fiction should include. This book has not educated me further on geometric concepts, nor has it enlightened me of any time period of which this book is said to be mirroring. Instead, it has wasted my time, which is precious to me now, and has completely confused me. Do not purchase this book. Do not assign it as required reading and most definitely do not read it for pleasure. There are other 80 page books that you can spend your time on.  Read anything else before you read Flatland 
 This was my first Patterson book, and while I may still try some of his other works, this one was not interesting or gripping in my opinion.  The character development was weak.  The novel is full of twists in the plot, and has a few good moments, but the people seem too simple to really grab my attention.  If you have not read this author before, I would try a different book first.  I have heard that some of his other books are quite different from the books in this series. 
 Color me dense, but after going through 8 Mr. Coffee coffeemakers in the past 10 years I'm tossin' in the towel!   The longest period of time that one has lasted was about 18 months. I just think that a person should be able to get more than 12 to 18 months of use out of a $40 to $50 coffeemaker that is used to make only one pot of coffee per day. The problem with 5 of these 8 coffeemakers was the heating plate going out...ie just ceasing to heat at all. The problem with the other 3 was leakage...massive leakage, as in an instantaneous rupture in the water tank and the entire content emptying within a few seconds!   So, after having cleaned up my most recent Mr. Coffee spill just a few minutes ago, I have finally (duh) decided it is time to give up on Mr. Coffee coffeemakers and never allow one of the foul quality beasts to darken my countertop again!   My advise is...if anyone wants to buy a new $40 to $50 coffeemaker every year or so, buy a Mr. Coffee...otherwise steer clear of this poor quality product and shop for another brand. As to which brand of coffeemaker?...I have yet to discover that answer as I type this, but as I am searching I can promise one thing...it definitely will NOT be a Mr. Coffee product!  This is the first comment/complaint I have ever written about a product on Amazon, but I was so peeved about this last mess I had to clean up that I felt the need to vent a bit.  
 Entirely useless for those who need a quick, encyclopedia-like idea of what this multivalent word actually means. For a reader looking for what the series promises - an introduction - it appears as a confusing hodge-podge of quotes from works of fiction, information about Algerian rai music which the author raves about like a teenager, all-too-familiar diatribes about pet causes of Attac and their ilk (evil companies exploiting hapless Africans etc.). It drips with political correctness of a mind-numbingly simplistic sort, embraces the rallying cries of postcolonialism (as a political movement) without the slightest hint of distance or criticism or, indeed, without even as much as discussing the merits of the claims in question. This book is a pamphlet of the crudest sort, by no means a work of scholarship 
 When I first read the reviewer who listed detail after detail that was wrong with the book, I thought he's just picayune.  OH NO!!!!   This is the sloppiest published work I have ever seen.  Some typos (and there are typically 3 or more per page)are so bad you can't even guess at the meaning of the sentence.    The writers obviously know and love their subject--it's just too bad no one edited or proofread their work.  Ironically, they tout their superior research as uncovering various inaccuracies--to what end, when it's published in this garbled format?  He's right about the photos, too.  Why are they so indistinct and faint?  Finally, there is no rhyme or reason to the order in which the material is presented.  While each bit might be interesting, chronological order or grouping by topic certainly would have lent more impact and avoided repetition.  (It actually looked like sections were merely cut and pasted several times) 
 These were horrible.  I thought I'd try raw foods and I amde a big mistake 
 the book is boring the stories  short and not interesting.  the book is more a travel book than a ghost book! 
 The boys at GSAM clearly wrote this book as an "alternative" to Grinold and Kahn and to help promote the group as the seek to raise assets.   Grinold and Kahn work at Barclays Global Investors, GSAM's biggest competitor, and they wrote a first-rate book on how to do quantitative management. Their book has become the standard, the must read, and is required by the CFA exam. This obviously bugged them to no end. It's no fun to see your biggest competitor getting tons of accolades. So they did what anyone with a big ego does: they wrote their own book, this book.  Only problem is this book STINKS. What's the matter with it you ask? It has no content. The boys at GSAM were so scared about divigulging anything that could help a competitor (or the market) that they didn't really want to SAY anything.   Now how do you not say anything but still write a book, you ask? Excellent question! The answer is you talk in infuriatingly broad generalities about very general topics.  For example, on the topic of how do you actually trade the portfolio, they come up with such gems of wisdom as:   "Tradomg is the process of executing the orders derived in the portfolio constrution step. To trade a list of stocks efficiently, investors must balance opportunity costs and execution price against market impact costs." [page 431]  This knowledge anyone who has ever thought for 2 seconds about trading knows. The real value might come if they gave you some cool way to think about measuring opportunity costs, ex-ante. Or a nice way of estimating market impact costs. Do they do either? Of course not! Just more and more banal talk.   The book is filled with millions of other examples. One should use a decay weight in estimating covariance matrices. How should we choose that decay weight is of course never mentioned or discussed!   They tell us when choosing between factors to predict returns, "the real challenge is to winnow down the list of factors to a parsimonious set." Okay, how might I do that you GSAM gods? They never ever tell you [see page 420]  You get the point, just lots of blather and really no content.  Save your money and don't buy this book. They don't need your money they have enough already. And it's not like you are getting knowledge or anything valuable in return 
 Gideon's Spies is packed full of exhilarating and outlandish tales of the Mossad's exploits.  It is, however, notably short on accuracy and journalistic integrity.  Some of its claims are obviously false and many others cannot be substantiated and hinge of the testimony of mysterious unidentified sources. The book reads like fiction and many of its stories likely are just that 
 We read this book for a graduate class on teaching other cultures. While I was disappointed at the lack of practical applications of the book, it did help to open my eyes to the idea of White Dominance. There are factors of a white-dominated culture that are invisible to us whites, and Howard does a good job of bringing those to light.  Much of the book is comprised of personal narratives, about Howard living in an economically-recessed area while attending Yale. It was then that he began to question his assumptions about racism, and the rest is history.  I do, however, believe that he is using this book as a way of marketing his REACH center, which is an organization that trains teachers in cultural awareness, and also designs curricula for schools.  Overall, this book is a good place to start when considering the implications and hazards of teaching other cultures, but just the book by itself does little to enlighten 
 Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious.  Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book.  I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was "forced" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug.  This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't.   I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so.  Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any.    
     Two stars for the version. I was heartened to see that this was a two-disc edition, as I figured it meant both the original version and the less-effective director's cut would be available. Alas, there is just a completely different movie on the second disc, and the headlining film is the lesser version. If you want to see this movie properly, with Delphine Seyrig's sung theme song, and tighter, more effective editing (why do we always suppose that meddling is an improvement?), you're going to have to get on EBay and find the original VHS, with the big, oversized box (not to be confused with the VHS of the original release of the director's cut). [NOTE: according to the comment below, the longer version came first, not second, as I had thought, so make of that what you will, although that hardly changes my opinion of the two versions.] It won't be DVD, and it won't be widescreen, but it will be worth it. When I first saw the director's cut, I was surprised by how saggy it made the film (and the dropping of that theme song is criminal). What a disappointment that the second DVD release of this film has not remedied the error, or at least given us both versions.      By the way--what is with giving an "unhelpful" review to reviews that don't recommend something, regardless of whether they have been helpful or not? It's kind of weird. I don't care if my review is tagged as unhelpful, esp if you actually think it is, but if you read a review and it doesn't say what you wanted it to say, that is not "unhelpful," it is "something you disagree with," and there is no rating system for that. 
 I think this book should have been entitled Over 60 and Gettin' Stronger. I'm 46 and I was really looking forward to getting this book in the mail. I think it is more geared to people over 60. Quite a few of the models were much older. I won't get a lot out of this book as far as exercises go. Quite a lot of the exercises weren't using dumbbells. You get the impression from the cover that the exercises will be heavily geared to using dumbbells but this isn't the case. I was disappointed with this book. I recommend Weight Training For Dummies which gives you excellent information and exercises to do. And also, Smart Girls Do Dumbbels by Judith Sherman-Wolin. That book is loaded with dumbbell exercise.  
 I borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read. It is the first Barr book I have read.  I did not like it because of several reasons.  First of all, THE VULGAR LANGUAGE was too much.   One can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter.   Second, it was so mundane for a mystery.  The writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in Yellowstone National Park.   Someone needs to give me a book of Barr's to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk. (By that I mean words one would use in professions of integrity.)  
 I'll save you some time. Read the Sept 30th post from a Reader from Zurich. I couldn't have said it any better. This book was shallow and a disappointment 
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 This book is very problematic in the fact that, despite the author's claim of "three or four technical reviewers", there are coding problems which could have been easily caught by testing the code.  For example code given on pages 89-90 for a script generate errors abut undefined variables and .  I double checked my code against the book and found no differences. I downloaded the source code from the author's web page and used that and received the same errors.  The author's website also makes it clear that she is somwhat unreceptive to these errors being pointed out when I went to the site advertised for her to see if there were any corrections and such. She does not even provide a means to contact her and from the tone of her "Contact Information" page, she does not take to kindly to being called on the carpet.  This book is definitely a work in progress and should not be purchased by anyone wanting to actually learn PHP 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 I had to skip the first few chapters 'cause he kept talking about his personal life and blah blah. I finally get through that and it starts off w/ Kindergarten level investing. I read through a few more chapters and then I had to let it go. Not for me but not necessarily a bad book 
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 I purchased this mouse 5 months ago and it has been total frustration ever since. The buttons on the sides are not easy to access or use. But most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform. When I clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages. I know some may be thinking I haven't configured the settings correctly but I went over it several times and couldn't get it to work right.  What's even more frustrating is the support at Razer is non-existent. They never responded to my email questions which I submitted several times before giving up. I ended up buying a Wacom Intuos 3 tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more. I am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse/pen tool for my needs.   Don't buy this product. I would have given it a negative 5 stars if that were an option. At $43.65, it's a steep price to pay for the frustration and a complete waste of time and money 
 I remember when I was in fifth grade, I snuck downstairs late at night to sneak a peek at the original Halloween when it was on HBO. I was mesmerized and scared to death at the same time. "The Shape," aka Michael Myers, was a chilling and oddly fascinating character. The sight of his shadow on the side of a building sent shivers up my spine.   I remember a scene that showed his silhouette against a house for a few seconds and the camera cut away as someone caught a glimpse of him. When the camera returned, he was gone. Little things like that scared me more than what little blood there was. Halloween sparked a number of imitators that added buckets of blood, but none of them had those little scary touches like the scene of "The Shape" against the wall.   So when Halloween: H20 was announced, I was at once a little skeptical but excited. Jamie Lee Curtis would reprise her role as Laurie Strode, the survivor of the first and second Halloween movies. H20 would be ignoring those sequels from 1982 to 1996, that had basically turned the storyline into another slasher epic, with the addition of psychic powers, strange secondary characters and a complete loss of focus on the true nature of what had made the original so powerful. With a lot to live up to, Halloween: H20 had the potential to disappoint as easily as it could return the series to greatness.   Unfortunately, the movie does not live up to the original. It barely matches up to 1981's unnecessary Halloween II. It tries very hard to be better than those other, now ignored, sequels, but it doesn't quite make it.   It's now 1998 and Laurie Strode has moved to Northern California to take a job as the head of a private school. She has a 17-year old son named John (Josh Harnett), who attends the school. Laurie and John have been battling the demons inside Laurie's head in different ways. Laurie copes through alcohol and John tries to keep her straight. It's beginning to take a huge toll on both of them, and something's got to give. A visit from Michael Myers, however, is not quite what they need -- but it's what they get.   I'll leave what little plot is left to the movie. If you decide to see it, you won't need to take notes to keep anything straight. It's as simple as slasher movie plots get, with plenty of false scares and predictable dialogue. The movie tries hard to be unique, even including appearances from L.L. Cool J, Adam Arkin and Janet Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis' real life mom and Psycho star.)   However, director Steve Miner, who directed Friday the 13th Part II and Friday the 13th Part III, attempts to pay homage to the original by aping some of its best scenes. Only one, involving a closet, pays off. The rest are so blatantly lifted from the 1978 original, it gives the movie a by-the-numbers appearance, as if Miner expected to regain the greatest of the original by taking the best scenes from it. That's like attempting to retain a painting's originality by simply taking a picture of it. It may look good from far away, but up close it's going to be missing more than a few key elements.   If nothing else, Halloween H20 serves as an adequate final chapter in the splintered timeline of the Halloween series. That's about it. 
 I must admit that a misguided person gave me this book. Worse yet, she expected me to swoon and join her on my knees and pray for rapture.   Of all the foolishness that is damaging our world, LaHaye's products must be among the worst culprits. I managed to finish this book, and between laughter and rolling of eyes, all I can say is "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY." 
 I was looking for more information.  Thought it was over priced for what I got 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 The main disappointment with this movie was the excessive number of shots of the cars zipping through empty roads as compared to the number of points won by mowing down citizens. Actually not that many of the latter - the satire (such as it is) could have been much sharper and more extravagant here. Did the Director feel that stepping up that side of it would be too shocking?   Otherwise the movie has an agreeable facile sense of the period (bad hair styles, would-be funky music, absurd sets, inane plot, cheapo design all round). So worth a watch. But not the witty classic I had expected 
 black and blue is the name of this horrible album which these backstreet thugs blatantly and unashamedly stole from the legendary stones.this music reeks.it is one of the worst of the worst.AN ABSOLUTELY AVOIDABLE TRAVESTY OF AN ALBUM.get the original black and blue album from the stones instead.minus trillion stars 
 I am sorry that this book does not seem very useful to me.  This text is highly recommended by noted authorities in woodworking.  Much of the information seems very dated.  Other areas, such as descriptions of joints and specific types of dovetails seem to be too limited to be of use to a novice like myself.  I feel I wasted money on this purchase and I wish I could see the value that much better craftsman than myself place on it 
 =+= Opening Statements =+=   Harry Potter:And the Sorcerors stone, takes after the book by J.K. Rowling. The book was excelent, the movie was not.   =+= Plot =+=   This movie, as do the books, take after the life of Harry Potter, a wizard that lives with his aunt and uncle along with with his cousin Dudley. Ok, they got that part right...but they keep on keepinbg out key sceans. Like the part when Snape refs Harry's Quiditch game. And, the parts that they DID keep in were pretty poorly done. Many parts had a lot of attemps at comedy, but they did not succed. Also, the animation was TERRIBLE. Play Station 1 graphics were better then that! But, they did keep on the plot pretty good so..   Plot score: 2-5   =+= Cast =+=   Let me start out by saying, that the actors that are showing their true colors now, were terrible back then. Danaile Radcliff plays Harry, poorly at that. He is AWSOME today...but terrible in the first one. Same with Emma Watson and Rupurt Grint, AWSOME actors/actress now, terrible back then. Richard Harris did an AWSOME job (as usual) in his role as Dumbledore. Also Allen Rickman as Snape did awsome. Not sure if it was the writing, or just their acting skills, but the acting did poorly, except Richard Harris and Allen Rickman, so..   Casting score:1-5   =+= Music =+=   John Williams was very famous for his music in such films as Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan, and War of the Worlds, came back to do Harry Potter, and boy did he deliver. The music in this movie was very well done. The theme was very good, and also he made the music as it went along with the movie so...   Music:5-5   =+= Closing Statements =+=   Harry Potter: And the Sorcerors Stone, a poor movie off of a perfect book. Is that what J.K. Rowling gets for all her hard work in making the books? I was really board in this movie and I had thought that reading words from pages was a lot funner, then looking at images on a screan. Though SOME actors were good, and the music was excelent, you cant just live off of those two things.   Final Score: 2-5    BTW..JustThinkin is me..I needed a new accoun 
 I bought this specifically for information about using the new LiveCycle Designer application that comes with Acrobat Professional to create interactive PDF forms. All of the information in this book (Chapters 26-29) is wrong about that app--none of the dialog boxes match, or are even close, and the program doesn't work the way it's described. I'm guessing that Adobe changed it after the book was written. 
 When a friend and I read the back of the DVD at Blockbuster, we were intrigued by the plot, not to mention the incredible cast.  We checked it out with anticipation of a great flick.  I wouldnt even consider what we were feeling as dissapointment; I would describe what we felt as pure regret!  The acting on the part of Elle McPherson was awful!  The character development in this movie was null and void.  I dont understand how other reviewers can say that this was a fabulous movie depicting real life situations about women...I dont know about you but I dont have internal conflict with everyday lesbian experiences, my mother never tricked me in to thinking I was adopted so that I'd get along with my siblings.  I dont know what happened in the other two 'chapters' because we turned this atrocity of a movie off after 2 hours of pure hell.  If you want to make a movie about womens issues, make a movie about our rights, our health issues, being a mother, etc. This was just a poorly written script with a good cast who couldnt even save it from the depths of the hideousness that is called A Girl Thing 
 This is the first review I have ever written.  I decided to write the review, because this is the first book I have ever purchased that I cannot finish.  If you took the facts from the book, you could only fill up a pamphlet at best.  If you want to read one big editorial about the author's political views, then this book is for you.  The author would like you to believe that everyone in the book is pure evil.  Maybe the book got better after page 125, but I will never know.  Terribl 
 I bought this album after hearing America, their single off this album, and listening to the increasing hype about Razorlight and Johnny Borrell being one of the most talented singer-songwriters of his generation. This follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. The songs all sound like I've heard them somewhere before, and the lyrics - well, how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone, nothing on the radio, and not known what it all meant, while smoking cigarettes late at night. Yawn... 
 Harrison writes as though he desperately wishes he had something interesting to say, but knows that he does not.  To cover this lack (including that of a decent story) he attempts to copy the writing style of some of Samuel Delaney's more chaotic books, but with none of Delaney's flair.  Nearly all of the book is tedious and filled to bursting with boringly insipid gratuitious sex and violence.  Sadly, his characters also lack plausable motivation for their actions.  There is little internal coherence to the story, and far too much reliance on attempted shock/weirdness value to carry the story, such as it is.  It takes Harrison some 200 pages out of a 300 page book to finally start telling the story the way he should have been doing  from the beginning.  The only reason I give it a star at all is because of the last 50 to 90 pages and because of one idea he mentions in the last couple of pages.  I'm severely disappointed that so many of my current favorite authors reviewed this book so highly.  I can only think that they have a policy of not pissing off anyone who may later be asked to review one of their own books 
 If this just came on my TV and I hadn't stuck it in myself, I'd seriously think this was a comedy skit-a workout parody. She bounces around like a cheerleader and is laughably over the top with her expressions. It's seriously like someone let the air out of a balloon and it's going all around the room out of control and making funny weird noises. There doesn't seem to be a real focus to the workout, just to keep randomly moving. The only good thing I can say is I did sweat a little and there is variety. It's not one I'd buy over again. 
 Shannon Drake's first 3 Vampire books were awesome, but this book is so boring it takes a lot of effort to keep reading it. The Awakening isn't a very good title for this particular book, it should be called The Sleeping. That's just what you want to do while reading it. She brings back her characters from her first 4 books which is a good thing. The book does tend to get OK toward the end, but mostly your just glad that you finally finished it and can now put it away someplace where you won't have to look at it and be reminded of the time you wasted reading it 
    O.K. I didn't buy the book, but I searched for reference to "immortality", which, as I suspected would give a very concise philisophical snapshot of the author. Lets see now, he speaks of the "demographic" problems associated with longer life and lower firtility. First obvious flaw in his reasoning is that we would be marginally active and retire for the last 40 to 50 or so years of a radically extended life(or 1000 years or so). The premise is rediculous because the goal of adult onset gene doping would be to extend health and vitality. Immaging a world in which you could live to 150 years or so with the strength and clearity of a 40 or 30 year old? Are you going to just "sit down in your rocking chair"?      Even going with the worker ratios, in Japan for instance that he speaks of, only 2 for every 1 retired, we could adjust the theory that social security operates-if you retire at age 65 with indefinite life span, you should collect for just 20 years-go back to work, start a business. Go back to school-learn something new-all better ideas than just infering that we should just roll over and die because redical life extension might cause some potential "problems" with systems put in place when humans were suffering and dying at young ages.     Also, "age differences" between the developed world and the underdeveloped world. Yes, there will be definate philosophic differences but they exist for other reasons rather than just "older women"(refering to aging populations that will have a slight increase in female to male ratios) in the North and "younger men"(refering to a higher male to female ratio in younger populations-as well as selective gender bias) in the South, or underdeveloped world. Maybe the influence an older, somewhat more femine population in the West might be a moderating influence governing our policies with regard to the rest of the world? Just a thought. But-waite a minute! Life extension will be available to the men as well as the women, unless we find more men just wanting to "roll over and die".        Mr Fukuyama seems to be saying that changing anything that "makes us human" is wrong.       I have a question to pose to him and any of you out there.      What is so good about being "human"? Lets see, we are a vehicle for the "The Selfish Gene" which only cares about its transmission from one temporary entity to the next-and after the age of reproduction-who cares? Right? So we are disposable!Birth-Shcool-Work-Reproduction-Death. Right about when we start to begin to live, the genetic time bomb begins to visabley manifest itself.       Like Francis, I was born in the middle of the "Baby Boom" generation. I am looking forward to human intellegence being able to preserve precious consciousness indefinitley. I have always known it would happen and I have a better than 50% chance at seeing this. This was considered impossible 30 years ago and I (and others like me) would state this and be shrugged off. What is really of concern to me is that now, we know it is possible but that some believe we should just "roll over and die"! Rediculous! We should persue radical life extension and also encourage near zero total birth rates so we can escape the Birth-School-Work-Reproduction-Death senerio!  
 Shermer's book is an attempt to classify various lines of research into science, nonscience, and `borderlands' science, but he follows no rigorous methodology.  Instead, he subjectively classifies various theories, practices, and lines of research into his three categories, based upon how popular certain theories are among mainstream scientists, and how much the theories, practices, and lines of research appeal to his narrow scientific fundamentalism.   There really is no need for this book.  The celebrated philosopher Karl Popper brilliantly solved the problem of the demarcation between science, and philosophy, ideology and nonsense decades ago, and his work has been endorsed by scientists from Einstein to Hawkings. The criterion is testability.  Scientific theories are theories that are capable of being tested by experiment or observation. Our theories can never be proven correct, although a single counter-instance can prove them wrong.    One can sum up Popper's famous demarcation between science and non-science by saying that the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability.   Accordingly, theories that are not falsifiable in principle cannot claim to be scientific, and so belong to metaphysics, ideology, or pseudo-science.   Popper's criterion of testability provides a clear, logical way of separating science from ideology and philosophy.  Hence, string theory is not science but philosophy, as it currently makes no predictions capable of being tested.  Popper argued that Marxism started out as a scientific theory: it predicted that capitalism would lead to increasing misery among the masses, and then be overthrown by revolution and replaced by socialism; it also predicted that this would occur first in the most technically developed countries.  When the so-called worker's revolution first occurred in then-backward and agrarian Russia, supporters of the theory did not accept this as a refutation: the theory was simply modified so that it became immune to falsification.  In other words, Marxism was transformed into an ideology.  The universal property of scientific theories cannot be stressed enough.  A scientific theory cannot be merely speculation about a particular fact or an isolated event, because nothing new and non-trivial can be predicted from such a speculation.  This point has to be stressed, because it has caused a great deal of confusion among philosophers and historians of science.  For example, Shermer writes in the book:   "Popper's attempt to solve the problem of demarcation ... between science and nonscience begins to break down in the borderlands of knowledge.  Consider the theory that extraterrestrial intelligent life exists somewhere in the cosmos.  If we find out by making radio contact through the SETI program then the theory will have been proven absolutely ... But how could this theory ever be falsified?"    Shermer's mistake is his categorization of the statement `extraterrestrial intelligent life exists somewhere in the cosmos' as a scientific theory.  It is no such thing.  It is merely speculation about a specific fact, from which no non-trivial predictions follow.  (For instance, it does not follow from this that such life would want to contact us, would share our values, would be friendly toward us, and so forth.)  It is no more a scientific theory than the statement `there are white swans somewhere on the lake.'  Such statements about specific factual matters can indeed be confirmed, even proven `beyond all reasonable doubt.'  But this is only because they are not universal statements.  Scientific theories are universal statements about how facts fit together, and from such universal statements follow predictions about specific facts.  So, from the universal statement `all swans are white' follows the prediction that `the next swans we will see on the lake will be white.'  The former is a (simple) scientific theory; the latter a prediction about a specific fact that follows from the theory, and that may used to test the theory.  Note that Shermer would have formulated his idea as a scientific theory if he had stated it in a universal, testable form, such as: "life arises quickly wherever there is water and an average temperature above freezing, and given a few billion years, some of this life will become recognizably intelligent."  This is a universal statement that relates specific facts to each other, can be used to make predictions about how much intelligent life exists elsewhere in our galaxy, and can be tested (at least in principle) by sending probes to planets in which conditions for life appear to have been appropriate for a few billion years.  If intelligent life is not found, then the theory is refuted, and must either be abandoned or modified.  It is precisely at the "borderlands of science" that Popper's criterion works so well.  Parapsychology for instance, most certainly is a science to the extent that it makes predictions capable of being tested.  But Shermer gives little attention to this field, as it conflicts with his ideology of materialism.  Shermer is not a scientist, but an historian.  And as an historian he has no excuse for being woefully ignorant of the history of science.  At one time reports that rocks sometimes fall from the sky (what we know call meteorites) were dismissed by most scientists as superstitious fantasies.  The idea that the continents could drift was ridiculed for decades.  Even X-rays were considered an elaborate hoax.  Those who ignore the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them, and Shermer has simply not learned that popularity of ideas cannot be used as a guide to separate science from nonsense.    But Shermer is an intellectual lightweight who is simply out of his league when discussing the philosophy of science.  If you want to read something really magnificent on the subject, I recommend "Replies to my Critics", in The Philosophy of Karl Popper, Part II, edited by Paul Arthur Schilpp.

 My first read of a Jon Jackson novel, and after reading the reviews on here I had higher hopes than the book delivered. At times it was very good, well paced, clear characters and action and then it would wander of on some side road for a period of time. Given that the Detroit detective's name is featured on the cover, I kept wondering when he would appear. Well, not for quite a while and then the most interesting aspect of his life is his living arrangement with his ladlady.  I believe this needed more re-writing than it got 
 Overall, this isn't a bad sunscreen. It contains avobenzone, which is recommended by dermatologists for its broad-spectrum protection.  The scent is light and not too objectionable.  It's a little thicker than some sunscreens, which makes it more difficult to spread, but it also ensures more complete coverage.  One minor drawback is that it's greasy and sticky, as are most sunscreens.  But the worst problem is migration into the eyes (Coppertone products seem to be among the worst with this).  Since it's advertised as waterproof and "non-stinging" and is specifically targeted for use on young children, you'd think it would be safe to use close to the eyes, but such is not the case.  My young daughter had a small amount of water splash her face, and she instantly felt the sunscreen stinging her eye.  This was about an hour after application, and the amount of water that hit her eye was only a few drops.  The debilitating discomfort persisted for the entire day and couldn't be relieved by rinsing her eye with saline.  (Water Babies isn't waterproof on the eyelids, but apparently it sticks pretty well to the eye itself!)  So the bottom line is that this sunscreen is acceptable for use on the body, but avoid using it anywhere near the eyes 
 Here are some of the do-able jobs Jacobson writes about:  apartment manager massage therapist personal chef factory go-between start your own 900 number casino jobs hotel help restaurant work karoke performer private mail carrier hairstylist braille transcriber  Do these jobs seem like you can start them today?  I was hoping to find ways to supplement my income, instead these are for unemployed or underemployed people who want to create a new line of work for themselves and are willing to invest some money and time. Also, some of these jobs are specific to areas of the country so if you want to be a script reader or location manager, you will have to move to the right geographically location.  Sorry, for those who wanted to stay in Idaho and pursue their career as a party enhancer (p110) 
 The "filler" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from "Rebel Heart" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all! 
 Ok, first of all, read that ttle again. Don't you love how idiotic grown ups sounds when they try to, like, borrow the vernacular twists of their offspring for ironic employment in a, like, polemical setting? Reminds me of Cusack's dad in 'Better off Dead,' the way he keeps trying to talk to his son on his son's level. There's so much bad faith and pretension permeating this book- it's all there in the title...  As for the' author's "polemic," it basically consits of numerous, misinformed, tendentious tracts soldered together into a rusty heap. You've heard this spiel before, most likely from your grandparents or parents who just don't get it- that they had their time. This is our era. Our use of language reflects and underlines our differences from those who came before.   I particularly didn't like his seeming dismissal/blanket statement on hip hop. He really ain't down with the brothas, which is not surprising, given that he's a black intellectual, and there's nothing established black academics like more than a long-winded, whingeing harangue about the endemic evils of hip hop Kulture. Ugh. He doesn't even seem to possess much of a knowledge of hip hop artists or their work... Nada... There is much that I find execrable in said culture and in it's major 'artists' but still how can one overlook its myriad unifying and artistic elements... Even I manage not to fall prey to an all-too-easy reductionist formula, which seems to be the The main point here- the author views the degredation of the english Language through the lens of pop culture at large (as a bad thing, mind you), it begins in the evil counterculture 60's and... you know...   Digressive, ranting out-of-context mixed with counter-intuitive psuedo-linguistic gibberish. For example, the author holds up both Dylan and Tom waits as examples of artists who are reverred not for their songwriting abilities, but more for their authenticity, thir 'genuineness'. This is plain false. Laughably false. I've never met a fan of either artist who wasn't struck by their strange and completely idiosyncratic use of language. Moreover, the author seems to feel that pop culture music is driven by whites emulating blacks. True, up to a point. I love this stance, and from Chuck Berry to James Brown to Miles Davis to Funkadelic to Fishbone to Bad Brains, to the innumerable black influences on The Clash, I will never tire of pointing out that, basically, it's all black music. One would think that, at least on some level, this is a good thing... But no, it leads back to the counter-kulture (with a k) ideals that have subverted language...????   HUH?  The saddest thing is that, as a reactionary elitist, I'm inclined to agree with many of the author's basic points. But both his presentation and his defense of his points were so hare-brained and wrong, I just felt sullied. With friends like these...  
 Sounds like a great mix, based on a novel by Philip Roth. Mixed race ex-boxer prof (Hopkins) marries out into white community. Pretends he is Jewish. In later life meets screwed up younger white woman (Kidman) with whom he vainly tries to expunge his past. It takes more than eggs to make an omelette, however, and Robert Benton's dreary direction ruins any prospect of a good film. Worst part, Nathan Zuckerman - what on earth was the point of this character - (Gary Sinise). The scene in which Hopkins and Sinise try to dance the slow foxtrot together is one of the daftest and most pointless I have seen in any movie. Best character Ed Harris (Lester Farley) though badly underwritten - why had his relationship with Kidman broken down ? Because he was nuts or she had driven him nuts. She would have me 
 we received it with broken cover. It didn't work properly and stopped running every hour. We tried different ways to make it run, but nothing worked. We've returned it. It's just waste of money. On the other hand the COW-humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well. No complaints 
 Part of our Christmas tradition is watching "Merry Chritams Mr. Bean." Unfortuantely, this DVD includes only part of that classic episode. It's back to the VHS "Merry Mishaps of Mr. Bean" for another Christmas. How disappointingly analog 
 Not a great resource.  Too simplistic and incomplete. Some interesting info 
 The idea of eating less meat has always appealed to me. I found this book in hopes of learning how to find other sources of protein. I just wanted a book to tell me some easy to read guidelines, all I found in this book was a lot of big words. You have to have a PHD in nutrition to read it. The more I read the more confused I got. This book is NOT for the casual reader 
 This will require a large mitten in colder weather.   This does not appear to use electrical impulse. This will require more adapting to than you might think. When working, it is accurate. 
 We all know Repbulicans don't care much for the environment, and now we're chopping down trees to give more praise to a man whose son's ambition is paid for with American lives. Why was this book written? Are trhe Bush-Kochs suddenly strapped for cash?    The book, if you can focus on a father and daughter that aren't dripping with wealth and power, is good enough. I like GHWB, voted for him, but the lovefest is going way overboard.   And as for the $500 billion dollar aircraft carrier (the tenth and final Nimitz-class supercarrier) just commisioned and named after George, Sr---it was absolutely wrong to do so. The man CVN-77 should have been named after is Admiral James B. Stockdale. Admiral Stockdale, a distinguished naval aviator and test pilot flight instructor, flew over 240 carrier-based missions, earned 28 combat decorations, and after being shot down over North Vietnam in 1965, spent 8 years as a P.O.W., 4 years in leg irons, 2 years in complete darkness, tortured and beaten daily. It is amazing that he didn't go blind after 2 years in darkness, malnourished and sleeping on concrete. Despite all of his pain, his primary concern was always the welfare of his fellow prisoners and that they received enough food and proper medical care. Stockdale even organized a hunger strike when one prisoner was denied medical treatment. At one point, he knew that one of his fellow P.O.W.s was guilty of an infraction that would possibly lead to that prisoner's execution. His captors knew Stockdale knew who the guilty prisoner was, and tortured Stockdale without mercy. Knowing there would be more torture and fearful he would crack and give out the prisoner's name, Stockdale attempted suicide. Rather than bear the thought of one of his fellow prisoners being executed or subjected to the pain that was inflicted on him, he tried to take his own life. Stockdale's suicide attempt was unsuccessful, yet in the attempt, was the ultimate statement about Admiral James B. Stockdale, that he would rather have died than see a fellow American soldier suffer pain or death at the hands of their captors. That maybe true about GHWB, but perhaps not so about our current President. Adwarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1976, Admiral Stockdale died in July of 2005. Even GHWB would tell you that CVN-77 should have been named after Admiral Stockdale.   Why isn't that in your book, Doro? On October 7th, 3 days after your book was released, you christened the USS George H.W. Bush, CVN-77. It rained that day. So much so that the ceremony was closed to the public 
 I began reading this book with the hopes of picking up some fresh ideas on negotiating.  As a lawyer handling divorce and family cases, I frequently see a high-level of emotions between parties and I was curious to see if the authors had some insight into how to this might effect negotiations.  However, this book was incredibly basic, and I'm  not sure who it was written for because all it did was state the obvious.  There are better books available on negotiation and this book does not provide anything unique 
 Purely on the merit of hearing one of their fab early singles on the radio, I took a risk and bought this album hoping for more of the same. Save track 5, what I found however was a real horror story of a let down- an atypical sterile eighties sound barely redeemed by the intermittently thought provoking lyrics. A poor mans Smiths, I consider this group to be the most over rated 'under rated' band of the eighties and regard said album as personal insult to a purhaser who spent three hours flipping burgers in a hot sweltering kitchen to pay for it 
 I've always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn't wait to read Dear John. Well, there was no reason to rush. It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book.  I cannot wait for another Nicholas Sparks book, but only because I want to know that he hasn't lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck 
 I'll say this first: I am not a genius, and George Soros probably is. The book presented itself in an interesting Q&A format that made it easy to skip around and jump sections. That being said, it was still a struggle to finish.  I did not like this book because it was hard to understand and mostly discussed Soros' high-level theory on investment strategy. His theory, which Mr. Soros is very passionate about, has something to do with the universe always being out of balance. If you are a finance whiz who thrives in theoretical analysis, or if you are a new age guru curious about a billionaire's spiritual mantra, maybe you will like this book 
 While this story is truly an essential writing of Dostoevsky, it lacks the appropriate context to be read as sold in this copy.  If you are interested in reading "The Grand Inquisitor" without reading the rest of The Brothers Karamazov, I would recommend the Guignon edition, sold for only a little more.  This work includes the two chapters preceeding "The Grand Inquisitor" as well as what Dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale, "The Russian Monk," which follows this legend.  Dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole, but I think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy.  Additionally, this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by Charles Guignon, which is much more informative than the brief one by Anne Fremantle provided in this copy.  It is important to remember that "The Grand Inquistor" was not Dostoevsky's final answer in The Brothers Karamazov.  Reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both Dostoevsky's writing and philosophy and The Brothers Karamazov.  I would recommend reading the book as a whole instead [and I particularly recommend the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation for that: it is much more accurate to the original Russian].  Or at a minimum, reading the other edition of this book.  Either way, you will get a more complete glimpse to the genius of Dostoevsky, which this fails to provide.  The Grand Inquisitor is truly an essential read, but not in this presentation of it 
 I strongly believe that this book could easily create misunderstandings to a student of Harmony. i found this book almost chaotic when I studied it as  a Harmony sudent. In comparison to Walter Piston's Harmony this book has  not a straight and organised method of teaching and I only recommend it for  advanced students 
 I have twin 5-year olds and we travel every chance we get, from local treats, National Parks, and campouts, to the Smithsonian, old forts, and amusement parks, but I found it hard to take this book seriously when Disney World is actually not one of the 500 places to take your kids before they grow up but the Museo del in Prado in Spain is (recommended for ages 6 and over...having been there, the 7,000 paintings, although lovely, will not hold the attention of a 6-year old...unless he was born in a leap year).  You can add the Louvre, or Borobudur, or the Huntington Library for that matter.  I have been to 212 of the places in this book -- many of them worth mentioning for older people.  I am a fan of educational trips and stops, but a little fun is also necessary for the young ones, and this book makes it near impossible to actually plan a trip that drifts along from the locations in this book.  And really, Disney is the happiest place on Earth (I swear I don't work for them....but ask your kid -- Disney or the Hermitage?) 
 The meta-story of this film was potentially interesting, but only before the gathering of the bad actors of the roundtable.   One star each for Cross and Black, whose genuine talent are the only reasons to bother glancing at this movie. Unless you are the type to grow an emotional bond with unlikeable characters, whose masturbatory storytelling is untinteresting and unbelievable, I would recommend you spend ninety minutes of your life doing anything other than watching Melvin Goes to Dinner 
 I read this book as an overweight kid, and looking back, I can't believe that I thought it carried positive messages.  The main character's (Ned's) family eats as much as they want, but deny their son the same food during family dinners.  Ned gets sent away from his friends (apparently because he's a fat kid) to an fat camp where he learns nothing about health, and his overweight bunkmates are horrible, theiving, binging stereotypes.    The storyline about bribing Ned with a family trip to Disneyland to lose weight is a great setup for failure and sibling rivalry.  And a growing 11-year-old taking up a jogging habit to lose weight?  Get real! Frankly, I'm amazed that Ned doesn't develop a rampant eating disorder in this story.    If the author had been interested in a story about improvement in a bullied kid's physical and mental health, he would have been focused on more realistic and supportive methods involving unconditional love and support from Ned's family and school.  But this story is hugely focused on pressure to lower the number on the scale, and only when those scale numbers get down (by whatever means necessary) does Ned's life get better.  
 I made an errant judgment by not reading the reviews about the DVDs missing the original soundtrack before buying the whole collection.  I'm totally pissed because the show just isn't the same without it.  The original soundtrack was such an essential part of the show and the cheesy replacement doesn't give it the same vibe or consistency throughout the show.  The people responsible should be ashamed for releasing this show on DVD without it's original soundtrack.  I wonder if the tapes that were released a few years ago had the original soundtrack?  If so, i'll just buy those and transfer them to DVD 
 The most seemingly innovative part of Bruegmann's book is his attempt to create a history of sprawl.  His basic argument runs as follows: something vaguely resembling sprawl happened in ancient Rome and 18th-century Europe, therefore sprawl will forever be with us, therefore sprawl is unstoppable.  Bruegmann's argument fails because is that it totally ignores differences of degree. There is an enormous difference between   (1) a region where sprawl is just one lifestyle option among many and you can live an auto-free life in a city or a streetcar suburb (e.g. most of the United States in the 1920s, the NYC region today, and much of the rest of the world today)  and  (2) a place where buses stop running at rush hour and you need a car to be a functional member of society (e.g. some Sun Belt cities and most small towns).    It seems to me that situation (1) is indeed normal in an affluent society; situation (2) requires decades of bad public policies.     Moreover, Bruegmann makes concessions that eviscerate his argument.  On the one hand, he implies that sprawl is inevitable in an affluent society.  On the other, he admits that many metro areas have grown more compact in recent decades, and that cities are beginning to gentrify.  (I suspect that he was not quite sure whether he wanted to be balanced or to write a pro-sprawl polemic; sometimes he leans in one direction, other times not).  His attempt to deny government's involvement in sprawl is sometimes a bit silly.  In response to the argument that government-funded highways spread sprawl by making it easier to live in suburbs, he responds: "federal spending today goes more heavily per capita to central cities than to suburbs, primarily because of the enormous price tag of social security payments, which go primarily to an older population that remains disproportionately in the central cities."    First of all, this "analysis" is factually questionable: many cities actually have a slightly smaller over-65 population than their suburbs.  (For example, in Chicago, where Bruegmann lives, 10.3% of city residents are over 65, as opposed to 11.3% of all metro residents).   Second, highways affect where people live by making suburbs more convenient, while social security benefits benefit a suburban retiree as much as an urban retiree. (I suspect that they are most useful for whoever lives in a low cost of living area where your money goes farther- which means cities in some parts of the United States, suburbs in others).  Worst of all are the constant attacks against anyone who dares criticize the sprawl machine.  He constantly attacks sprawl critics as "elites."  This sort of "argument" exemplifies the ad hominem fallacy- attacking the person instead of the argument.    His attacks are as hypocritical as they are illogical; he brags about avante-garde architects who see "the spatial and ecological richness" of sprawl, and ignores the fact that a "road lobby" of construction companies and real estate interests generously funds politicians who favor suburban development and sprawl-generating expressways. It seems to me that these media star architects or large corporations are just as much of an "elite" as the environmentalists Bruegmann villifies.  Bruegmann's substantive discussion of the vices of sprawl is, by contrast, occasionally useful.  Where the data is uncertain, he (occasionally) says so; for example, he correctly suggests that there is no way to know whether more compact development would reduce fuel consumption enough to affect global warming, or how much of an effect sprawl has on taxes and spending.    But even in this part of the book, Bruegmann sometimes cannot resist the temptation to overreach: for example, he writes that "cause of [auto-induced air] pollution was neither sprawl nor the automobile itself, but, rather, the inefficient fuel source it used."  Of course, the "inefficient fuel source" only pollutes if it is actually placed in an automobile, and if the automobile is actually driven- both of which happen more often under sprawl.       
 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 When I first saw the commercials for HorrorFest, I was quite excited.  I checked out the previews online, and checked back every week or so to see when they would start posting venues, and then dates and times.  When I finally had all the information needed, including MapQuest directions...it all fell flat.  The directions were poor, and so I arrived too late to bother seeing the first movie I had planned to see that night, and the next TWO were completely sold out.  It was three hours until _Reincarnation_ was going to start, so there seemed little reason to bother hanging around the Elizabeth outlet mall.  HorrorFest had become dead to me.  For some reason, I had had no idea that these movies would be released on DVD, but when I did, I thought I might give HorrorFest a second chance.  I had previously found _Reincarnation_ on the eBay gray market, and wasn't thrilled.  So I ordered up the official releases by way of immediate interest, and picked this one up first.  I REALLY hope the others are far better than this one.  This movie intrigued me first because it seemed that there might be a comic element to it--the set-up seemed so cliche (insane killer escapes asylum to return to the spot of his original crimes, just when a group of college kids make a stopover on their way out on Spring Break), that I thought there might be a chance for some fun--over the top violence that might, like _Shaun of the Dead_, both make fun of and pay homage to its genre.  But no.  The humor of _Dark Ride_, if there is indeed humor to this, is thin.  With the prodigious amount of blood and guts and brutality that has already blessed the genre, the bar is now high, and this movie does little to meet that bar.  People are stupid in their usual manner for a horror movie, and the killings neither imaginative or offer any attempt at revulsion, just blood.  I wanted to think that all of this was at least a little cognizant of its typical method, but even the ending twist makes this movie a mere imitation of unimaginative horror, or if it's a parody, it's a parody that is so dull in execution that it is about as boring to watch as the movies it might be parodying. 
 I read "The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program" and became sugar-free by following this program in 2002. Instead of being addicted to sugar, I became sort of addicted to DesMaisons's website and whether or not I was receiving her approval on "doing the program" correctly.   After two years of denying birthday cakes and Thanksgiving pumpkin pie, I could no longer stand it and took on a sugar binge of Willy Wonkan proportions. I learned that I needed to find out how to live WITH sugar (in a healthy way) not live without it.  I tried a no-grain diet with lots of protein, fruits and vegetables. First I just did it on the weekdays only, but now I prefer to eat that way all the time. For guidelines on a no-grain diet, check out "The Paleo Diet" by Loren Cordain, or run a web search on "paleodiet." Today I can have a piece of cake now and then, or some ice cream. Amazingly, sometimes I turn down sweets... unheard of! The difference is that now I can stop eating sugar once I start.   It turns out I wasn't addicted to sugar at all. Eating sugar was helping my body compensate for low energy. This book didn't heal me of my core problem, but helped me to ignore it for a few years. I'm glad I found the real cure 
 I don't know what is happening with authors these days, but with each book they seem to get worse and Catherine Coulter is following trend. Ms. Coulter's early works such as "The Legacy Trilogy", "The Magic Trilogy" were really good, but "Pengragon"  was very bad. I didn't realy care about the either of the main characters and the only reason that read the book was the fact that I spent over eight dollars for it. Maybe Ms. Coulter and others should take a break and take the time to write a book that is worth its money 
 I have hope that someday Wes Craven will return to greatness, that his abilities as a filmmaker will once again outshine his horrible motives for movies like Scream 2, cursed, and Dracula 2000. I have waited patiently for him to make another cinematic cult classic like "A Nightmare on Elm Street" or "The Last House on the Left", but alas "Red Eye" fails to be anywhere near as good as those two previous movies. First of all, the flick is PG-13, which means no blood, no sex, and no good stuff that accounts for a horrible plot. A pair of breasts and a bloody brain splatter can make up for bad plot twists sometimes.  I must admit there are directors that can pull off a PG-13 horror flick but Wes Craven is not one of the chosen few. 	 As soon as the opening credits are over the plot has unfolded in my head, yeah it's that predictable. The main character Lisa is on the phone with her dad while in the airport. Her grandmother just kicked the bucket and she is hopping a red eye flight (creative title, huh) to visit daddy. Immediately you realize the old man has something to do with the story line, and he is obviously more than a destination point. While on the phone with Pops, Lisa puts him on hold to speak with Cynthia, a girl that is taking her place as hotel manager while she engages on her trip. Cynthia has to somehow be a victim.  Next Lisa meets a gentleman that buys her a drink in the airport bar and the two of them just so happen to sit next to each other on the airplane; he is obviously the bad guy. Not just because of the random circumstances, but he has those bad guy eyes. The movie is over from my point of view, besides a few inconsistencies, the viewer already knows that the father will be threatened if Lisa and Cynthia don't work together to make some violent action against a guest at the hotel. Now we all know that this won't happen because all crappy movies have happy endings. That is why seven was a splendid film by the way, the villain was triumphant. The guy that sits next Lisa on the plane will most likely be the only one who dies in the entire movie. It's all expected, and it's all dribble. Which may be why they made the movie PG-13, no one over the age of thirteen should be allowed to see it.  	This movie could have been saved, if the villain had a better plan, if he was more convincing. If the protagonist wouldn't be so heroic if her morals wouldn't be so goody two shoes. If the movie wasn't so black and white good versus evil it would have been tolerable.  
 I was disapointed with the book.  It might be useful for a novice user, but it doesn't get into the detail which I was expecting.  I have been pleased with other Sybex books in the past, but this one probably won't make it on my reference shelf.  If you are an advanced user searching for a rather technical book, I would not recommend this book 
 I don't know much about Lars Frederiksen, but he obviously doesn't think much of his band. He knows them a lot better than I do so he may be right, but I'm prepared to give them a chance. This is more of a compilation of other artists than a Lars Frediriksen album. Lars takes his vocal stylings from one popular punk rock band, while his drummer copies another, his guitarists steal from another, etc. I don't know which bands are borrowed from because they all sound the same to me. The man on the cover of this album has a mohawk hair cut which shows he is a big fan of the A-Team and Mr. T. I bought this album expecting to hear something Mr. T would be proud of and maybe some songs about Mr. T, but instead Lars chooses to whine selfishly about his own life. He breaks from this however to sing "Army of Zombies", a song about the SNES game "Zombies Ate My Neighbours". Overall this a decent Rancid album 
 I am so accustomed to raving about Kate Bush's recordings that it really pains me to write this one. This CD, while not horrible, is very disappointing. It seems she got sick of making interesting, quirky music and decided to just make some money with this one. It is very commercial, ridiculously over-produced and just could not have come from her heart. If you are a fan, you already own this. If you are looking for an introduction to Kate's music, buy "Hounds of Love". That CD is her masterpiece; "Red Shoes" should be veiwed as an asterisk in her amazing career 
 Written by two exceptional C++ gurus, I had expected more from this book, but came out disappointed because this book merely points out proper C++ programming as recommended from other books. This book is severly lacking in details and examples. So if you have read Sutter's other books (Exceptional C++, More Exceptional C++, and Exceptional C++ Style) and Meyers' books (Effective C++ and More Effective C++), then you will find hardly any new information here. But if you haven't read those books or if you are a new C++ programmer, then this book might still disappoint you because, as I mentioned earlier, this book often only points out good coding pratices but is short of details. Save your money, really. Borrow this book from a friend or library and photocopy the pages on "Summary of summaries" as a sort of pocket guide. Major disappointment.  Updated (Aug 8, 05): Whenever you have an author writing apologetics for his book, you know the book is in trouble. The main problem is that this book's two authors lack a strong justification to write a completely new book. Information found in this book is re-hash from elsewhere. It would have been better if the so-called "standards" found in this book be merely summarised into a concise list on the web, with references. Sorry, I am still unconvinced about this book. 
 why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can? These memory cards are way over priced.   I love PS2. It's one of the best systems I have ever played and owned, but this memory card stuff is a scam. I already own 2 cards and I need more. 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 There are three significant problems with this book. "Made in Detroit," is poorly written. Clemens thinks, "went over like a led balloon," is a fine simile. It is not. But Clemens begs his readers to compare him to Baldwin, Hemmingway, and others, a desperate attempt for sophistication he is unlikely to ever gain. (2) Clemens' book is racist and anti-working class to the core. Clemens clearly adopted his fathers' hatred of unions, and formed his own uncritical take on racism, expecting readers to chuckle at his portrayal of African Americans as "moolies." (3) Clemens knows nearly nothing important about Detroit. He views the city through an inverted telescope, each lens juncture narrowing his already myopic view; racism, sexism, the meanest forms of conservative Catholicism, his unexamined views of exploitation and resistance, all merge to give him a key-hole view of, not the city, but himself, his trifling family relationships, and his trembling edicts about his wife-who, I know from experience, is all aflutter about his critics. There are good books about Detroit, like "Whose Detroit?" or "American Odyssey" by Conot (openly fictional, unlike Clemens' piece), or Ewens, "Corporate Power and Urban Crisis," or Mirel's "Rise and Fall of an Urban School System." Clemens work is, flatly, too small-minded to be taken seriously. Only the fact that racism sells could lead local reviewers, and the publisher, to push this book. For those who seek my longer review of Clemens book, google "Michigan Citizen , Made In Detroit." I am the San Diego State prof critiqued in a review below. 
 I found the picture by picture style of this book not only anoying, but void of in-depth information. Premiere is phenomenally complicated. This book's "Simple Simon" approach shows how to do the basics step by step without explaining the fundamentals and technical information necessary to master video editing basics. My advice to someone who actually wants to LEARN Premiere? Don't try to take a short cut. If you need a picture book with step by step instructions to work through a software program, Adobe Priemiere is probably not the best video editing tool for you to learn. This book fails to explain the importance of the "Render" command thus confusing the begginer who can't understand why none of the technical tricks of the book are not working. In a nutshell, buy another book 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 Look at the world economy, Toyota just passed Ford in US, Sony is doing very good, even they make the dead-Ericson alive, look at Kodak, Panasonic, Honda, Japon Tobacco Ind, Seiko.... They all do excellent/very good, except a few industries as pharmetucals and FMCG, where US or Loreal gets all the profit from dumb products...  What is the reason for this? If you have some money to spend for nothing read this book, and read "Mind of Strategist" from Ohmae, and compare both of these books...   you will see the answer of the first paragraph above: US is dealing with theory and Japan with excellent execution.   This book is so theoretical that, almost none of the things mentioned are applicable. The critical thing is, even this book does not show how to think, since the writers are so much involved in theoretical aspects of strategy/game theory, in their offices at the universities that, applicability is dying in united states..  as told, there are some categories still US dominates, in belgium huge profits is done in pharmacy/beauty care products, as other US companies do in europe, (except Germany, Russia, UK, where Lever and Henkel is more powerful).  but all dying, thanks to theorical works as Co-opetition. As I told, please read Ohmae, and compare those books. The difference is so significant.   I do not know why this book get so much good comment, it can be due to positioning/image. But nothing inside. 
 it doesnt fit well. the joystick doesnt function right with it on. the buttons are difficult to use. the product was poorly mad 
 Some of you may be familiar with the movie that bears the same name as this book. It shares a lot of instances with the movie, even though it takes place on a smaller sloop instead of a frigate. Several movie scenes were derived from the book, including some instances of dinner time banter, as well as the rigging of a decoy raft for the purpose of throwing off a pursuer at night.  The story follows Jack Aubrey as he finally receives a ship to command, a 14 gun sloop captured from the Spanish, and named the Sophie. He acquires a valuable friend through his love of music, named Stephen Maturin, who turns out to be a physician and an amateur naturalist. The battlefield is the Mediterranean Sea, and the home base is Gibraltar. Most of the book deals with the extraordinary success of the Sophie as a merchant raider taking various prizes across the southern coast of Spain and France, culminating in her greatest feat, the capture of the Spanish frigate Cacafuego (which translates just how you imagine it would), a much larger, more powerful vessel. There doesn't seem to be a great driving plot to the story other than a telling of events, along with a few side-plots which seem to be only of mere cursory importance, largely due to O'Brian's writing style.  Patrick O'Brian writes in a style that's hard to follow, partly because it's written in the English of the time, and partly because it's exceptionally dry for what someone would expect from a war novel. The concept was very sound, but I had a hard time feeling as inspired about what was happening, without closing my eyes and adding my own visuals to the plot, and imbellishing the passion behind a lot of the action. This is illustrated by a few of the instances that were adapted to the screen for the movie featuring Aubrey. For one example, while speaking about his encounters with Lord Nelson, I remembered the setting vividly from the movie, with the decent performance from Russell Crowe, and the reactions and faces of the men around him while they listened. The gravity of the moment was very well portrayed. In the book, it passed like the droll reading of a ship's log. His story was stuffed in a paragraph of speech and passed as dryly as everything else, with hardly any descriptive detail given to Jack's reverence for the subject, or the emotional reactions of those listening. So much of the book is like that, so it helped me to keep a running movie in my head, adding much needed descriptive seasoning to what I was reading.  The book had its high points, and even a few amusing points. O'Brian seems to write better when there isn't much in the way of action going on. Though, at times, the characters have a hard time just being direct with one another, and in effect, the reader has to be sharp enough to read between the lines of what they're saying to get the real meaning. A case in point was when Stephen was examining Jack, only to declare that his problem had to do with the woman he was sleeping with, Captain Harte's wife, had been surprisingly friendly all around. I don't know if I'm supposed to derive from this that Jack had contracted a venerial disease, or if it was simply a warning about the threat of Harte's grudge. Either way, I wish that in this, and in many other instances, O'Brian had made the effort to make things more clear.  The book left me without the urge to continue the series. Maybe I'm an uncultured bafoon, but I'm not going to force myself to read things that don't appeal to my sense of entertainment. I don't think I should have to envision descriptive imbellishments and then hope I'm correct, in order to feel enthralled by the books I read 
 I bought 4 of their cd's from amazon after hearing the song "bad days" in a batman movie. This cd is the worst of the 4 i bought. Not one good song. Totally lame. I'm not even going to stick someone else with it. I'm just going to throw it out 
 This book is an innaccurate version of events in the the discovery of teh structure of DNA. What most people don't know is that Rosalind Franklin was crucial to the discovery of the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick actually stole most of her data via Wilson, her supervisor, adn passed it off as their own discoverery.  She was a brilliant scientist and should have been an independent researcher at Kings College, but because she was a woman she was made an assistant to Wilson. She was extremely dedicated and plowed through all the obstacles at Kings College. However, her supervisor, Wilson, showed most of her data to his old friend Crick, who shared it with his partner Watson. They too were studying DNA, although they were on completely wrong track. The data that was pilfered included the famous photo 51, which Franklin obtained over a course of years' work and revealed the spiral shape of DNA. They also positioned the competent of DNA, such as the bases, exactly as she hypothesized. Watson, Crick, and Wilson received the Nobel Prize, while Franklin could not, because she died at the age of 38 due to radiation exposure from the X-rays she used to capture photo 51. The men only mentioned her in passing when accepting their prize, and definitely not as the source of the actual discovery. Then Watson had the gall to write a book that casts her in a horrible light, as an inferior person who was bad tempered and selfishly hoarded her information. He also calls her `Rosy' throughout the entire book, although she despised that name. He once even went up to Rosalind and demanded that she hand over her data. He was a complete bigot, and thought her inferior and was furious when she refused to share her own findings to him. He harps about her appearance in the book, and it is obvious that is the only way he perceives her, and not as a thinking person. And for the record, she was actually quite striking, and wore the latest in French fashions. She was extremely dedicated, and her level of determination would have been completely accepted in a man. That's why I give this book a one, and if I could I'd give it a zero. Watson is just begging for comeuppance for what he wrote in this book. I would reccomend reading other books about Rosalind's struggle, such as 'Rosalind Franklin: The dark lady of DNA' 
 Hank is an idiot.  He caters to the ignorant who want some fancy desciptions to help them feel comfortable deepening their ignorance.  Hank hampers truth 
 If you are male, white, Republican, politically conservative, born before 1965, and have Andrew Jackson as your all time personal hero then by all means purchase this title.  I loved my copy so much I'm donating it to The Salvation Army.  
 It's difficult to determine whom this book is addressed to. A lay reader will come out none the wiser after reading the chapters on complex numbers and groups. Just dressing up powerful general ideas in vague, mystifying, and allusive prose serves no purpose. For instance (p.81) he refers to the heart-breaking charm of complex analysis. Yeah, so? These statements don't edify a lay reader. The same can be said for the discussion of Lie groups (pp. 100-101).  A mathematician on the other hand, will find the book redundant, and annoying -- both for its inaccuracies and general, loose vagueness.  
 I had higher expectations when I purchased this DVD. I was not disappointed technically but I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the acting as a whole and with the uneven singing of Rachel York.  She couldn't seem to decide whether she wanted a pop, jazz, or traditional musical theatre sound.  Her voice was all over the place.  Furthermore, I found her character very annoying...she was screechy and not at all vunerable.  I preferred Kathryn Grayson's performance in the movie as she managed to be vunerable, witty, and charming, as well as screechy, demanding, and somewhat tyrannical.  Truly, I could barely watch this entire video and at the end I could have cared less if Fred and Lilli got together.  I think that was the most powerful statement for me. The production was acted (or directed) with a lot of mugging and so much of it was over the top.  Can today's directors PLEASE leave something for the audience to think about and figure out themselves?  Everything need not be a commentary! I wish I had seen Marin Mazzie because I heard she was incredible. Rent this before buying it or better yet do what I did and buy it used.  It hardly cost anything and that is what is it worth 
 The movie could have been so much more with less caracter's. Liv Tyler is very good. Rachel Weisz is only in the movie for short stints but, memberable ones. The soundtract is better than the film. 
 This venture into the murky waters of historical speculation and machine-consciousness debates does tell you a few things if you are unfamiliar with Turing and Wittgenstein (otherwise, don't bother reading it). But while Turing's viewpoint is clearly stated from the start, Wittgenstein's is only done justice at the end. The other three characters in the book could be merged into a single one without any loss, and in general the entire book's message could be condensed in a few pages. Which would be pages worth reading if you like articles in easy-reading popular science magazines (which I have nothing against, and indeed subscribe to) 
 I just didn't like this book. I loved so many of Irving's earlier books, but I never believed this story nor cared for any of the characters. If you want to read a great book set in India, try Mistry's A Fine Balance. Infinitely better 
 The book "Child of Fire," by Scott O'Dell is not a book I recommend to young readers. This book deals with topics that readers who are not mature enough might not understand. For example violence and drugs  are strong topics dealt with in this book. There is also a part in the book  where the topic of abortion is mentioned. This happens when Manuel's  girlfriend Yvonne tells him she's pregnant and wants three hundred dollars  for an abortion. It ends up being a lie, she just wants Manuel's money.  Either way it is still a topic that should not be exposed to young readers  in a book,but if possible by their own parents.  The book is basically  about two young boys no older than sixteen who are both leaders in rival  gangs. These two boys, Manuel Castillo and Ernie Sierra, compete against  each other to see who is braver.Manuel's way of showing bravery is by  jumping infront of a gate when the bull charges out of the tunnel.Luckily  he does not get killed but risks his life just so people can see how  "brave" he is. Ernie Sierra is a drug dealer who exports drugs  from USA to Mexico using pigeons, like the ones used to send messages. Ben  Delaney is Manuel's parole officer, who is also the narrator of the  story.Throughout the story Delaney tries to keep Manuel out of trouble. I  guess the best human concern developed  by the author is courage. Not in  the part of the two boys because killing people and selling drugs isn't  being courages,but by the parole officer Delaney. Sometimes he had to face  danger just to try to keep the two gangs from fighting.For example when he  goes to Ernie's house to prevent Manuel from killing Ernie, he is risking  his life by being caught in the middle and getting shot. Delaney is afraid  of getting shot by Ernie, but he still tries to stop him from harming  others.  Throughout the story these two boys both commit acts that are  unappropriate for children their age. Like I stated before Ernie sells  drugs and also harms anyone that gets in his way. Manuel ends up in jail  for causing a mutiny on a ship he was working on, and ends up escaping from  jail. At the end of the story Manuel Castillo ends up getting killed by a  grape picking machine. Not by accident but by displaying what he thought  was courage or bravery. He jumped in front of the machine, (just like he  did before with the bull) and did not move when it came towards him. The  machine ended up squishing him just like if he were a grape.This story  shows young readers the wrong idea of being courages, and is therefore not  a book I recommend to young readers 
 I'm very disappointed in this book.  The vast majority of the book are reprints from "Velo News" and "Inside Triathlon" with subtle changes.  This is nice bathroom reading but hardly helpful with any actual training advice.  Perhaps I had the wrong idea of the content.  When I get my training program far enough along to look back in retrospect at what a great idea adopting the CTS philosophy was then maybe I'll pick this book up again and privately commiserate with the contributing authors that have had success.  If your looking for a "How to" guide to putting together a training program then I would not recommend this book.  If your like me and need help getting a structured approach to training then I'd recommend "The Triathlete's Training Bible" by Joe Friel 
 After hearing some decent things about this book, I was surprised at just how uninteresting and often offensive of a read it turned out to be.  Marlowe is accurate in some of her depictions of heroin use in the East Village of New York and way off base in others.  I chalk this up to everyone's experiences being different (however, I certainly don't think a one-bag-a-day habit with weeks off in between makes her an authority on addiction by any stretch of the imagination).  What I don't understand is why she felt the need to go into such great detail about her rather boring life between her discussions of the dope world.  Most of her anecdotes had little to no bearing on the story she was trying to tell and were mind-numbingly dull.  I found her narrative to be very disjointed and incoherent.  But what I found most repugnant was her better-than-thou attitude towards those of a lower class or darker skin tone (e.g. assuming dark-skinned men who didn't think to aspire to become more than security guards must not have gotten support or affirmation in their homes growing up, like she did).  She herself says that she became interested in street-life and street people in order to increase her "coolness" factor.  Sure she dabbled in drug use and in the East Village culture, but that does not make her an authority, and she does not paint a very true portrait of either.  If you want a good portrayal of street life and heroin use from the inside, read Seth Morgan's Homeboy.  If you want elitist drivel, this book should do the trick 
 The book covers only basic grammar;quite boring; doesn't make much sense. I would not recommand this book 
 Sean Hannity's rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country, especially when their audience consists of like-minded organ banks.  Hannity is stupid, hypocritical and loud.  His sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for carbon-oxygen exchange.  Hannity is well-coiffed, well dressed  and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the Hannity and Combs report.  This bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt 2 sizes too small.  Get a real job, you poser 
 I have read every book written about Stan Musial. I felt when I read this one the author was only interested in finding all the dirt he could find on this most wonderful person. I grew up watching this man play baseball. But most of all, I grew up watching a top rated human being. I really don't care about his personal life since I have met him many times and I don't have to have a book to tell the kind of person Stan Musial was or is. If you want to read dirt, than read Ball Four. That will keep you busy. If you want to read about a true baseball hero, I would suggest you read one of the other books about Stan Musial. They are what you could call real baseball books, ones by people know or knew the game 
 After reading Skinny Legs and All, and loving every word, I bought this book on tape.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with it and stopped listening after the first CD.  How many times do we need to hear about an extra large scrotum?  It must be repeated a hundred times, and it just wasn't amusing.  The reader, Barrett Whitener, tries to do the best he can, but his poorly contrived Japanese accent (which sounds more like a German accent), just doesn't cut it.  I'm sure if I gave it another 3 or 4 hours of listening, I might get hooked, but who has that kind of time to gamble?? 
 My naturally curly hair is thinning and I thought this conditioner would be helpful. The conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned. I thought it was too drippy. I nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand. I would not recommend this conditioner 
 "Hedda Gabler" has to be one of the most boring plays I have ever read.  If you're looking for action in a play, then stay away from this one.  Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll House" was mesmerizing and captivating, and this play is the exact opposite.  There was no point to the plot and the ending served no purpose.  Hedda was bored - that's the point; just shameful.  I do not recommend 
 Ok, I had to watch this movie for my Earth Science class, and it was good, but oh my God. I wanted to just punch some people! It was decent, only because of Tommy Lee Jones and Don Cheadle (I don't know how to spell his last name, but you know whom I'm talking about). Anyone else? Pf. Not cool.  Tommy Lee Jones plays this emergency help guy/dad, and he does it well. In the movie he fathers this 13-year old who can't really grasp onto the word "responsibility" until the very end. Its weird that he doesn't know what 'lava' is. You'll find that a bit weird.  Theres a part in the movie, where the construction guy (real ass in the beginning) goes in a subway car and saves the already dead driver, and he's moving sloooowly, murmuring a prayer, and when he gets to the ledge, the lava hasn't moved from out and under the subway yet. He stands there, hesitating. I was shouting "JUMP" like an obnoxious idiot. Then the lava came from under the subway train, and it flowed like, five feet in front of him. Finally (!) he jumps, throws the dead man to his co-workers and melts.  Another death scene: 2 geologists go down into the storm drain, and one finds the fissure. She's peeking in it, observing, concurring. Then, like a flash, an earthquake. The other geologist is messing with her flashlight, so she really doesn't notice what's happening. The concurring one suddenly tries to move away from it, but the fissure widens, which makes her fall. Heres the suspenseful part: shes hanging on the ledge. "Help me! Don't let go of me!" she begs, as the other geologist grabs her arm. Sadly, the glove that the ailing woman was wearing slides off, and bam. Dies.  TLJ's on-screen daughter is in charge of 2 children at a shelter. She goes off somewhere and comes back to find the youngest gone. So, she goes and looks for him and finally finds him outside where the BIG eruption was going to happen. The building behind her, though, is about to collapse. She like, realizes this, and she just stands there, holding the child, wailing for her dad. Its like, 'ok, RUN'.  OVERALL. This movie is ok if you like the whole disaster film thing. Its cheesy, but its good. I prefer this to Twister. It will make you not want to live in/move out of California, though. That's a caution you should take 
 This novel could not hold my interest.  I am an Anne Perry fan, but could not get into this book.  I couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting.   I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to a new series by her.  Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion.  Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.  In reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I would skip this series and read the Pitt series.   
 Well, I sure could have skipped this one.  I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me.  Mostly, I was just plain bored.  There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks.  Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President.  And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie.  But all the scenes were focused on the funny quip, the bon mot, no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work, or any answers to any questions about Clinton either, for that matter.  
 The only thing I can say about this movie is mediocre, it is most certainly not the worst story & play I have seen, but it also far from thrilling.  
 I got hooked on Tiesto about 5 years ago. Heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album. Neverhteless, it wasn't but it was still tiesto though right? Well...the hits on this CD are about 5 years old. The build ups are terrible and I felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists. Stick with "Tiesto:Nyana" ...10130340345435 times better 
 A great musician but a man desperate for intellectual respect.  The book is virtually 400+ pages of an application for membership into some haughty Paris salon.  Caetano should have stuck to what he knows best-music.  The endless and mind-numbing name-dropping and references to obscure books, artists and philosophers are the written equivalent of a 5 minute arena drum solo.  OK, we know you are smart, that you have ecletic and fine taste, etc. Now tell us about your music. How did you write it, how did you record it?  There is sadly too little information about music and too much dismissal of others for perceived intellectual deficiencies, musical or otherwise.  Speaking of his music, I recently saw Caetano in concert and was shocked by the syrupy shmaltz--he actually performed "Feelings" in English and in total sincerity. He virtually refused to perform anything in Portuguese, perhaps it is not a cerebral enough a language...nothing more than feelings.  UPDATE:  Another reviewer found my review above to be in error, because Caetano is "30 years ahead of his time" in singing one of history's most painfully bad songs, Feelings. The reviewer found the whole thing very funny. I am sure that the reviewer has the famous Teutonic sense of humor to appreciate the joke.  I for one, heard a corny song in accented English.  Forgive me for missing the joke while I tried to cover my ears 
 Saw this on TV while Puppy sitting.  I have no love for comic books and their simple stories and two dimensional heroes. B-Film Movies based on their format are worse.  Made like the B-films of the thirties and forties, this film wreeks. Costuming is great. Its brilliance is in the technologies that created it but gets low marks in stories and characters. From the hansom heroic Sky Captain and his specially made P-40 sinister and mysterious Mad Scientist Professor Totenkopf whose robotic drones are robbing the world of materials for an unknown purpose while assasinating his former colleagues, this is really pathetic junk. The heroine or Love interest is clueless, slightly airheaded and not trustworthy. In one scene she walks through jungle on high heals. The sidekick is rayguns on the brains. Plot is plotless.   Overall, this film is interesting technology but otherwise awful. 
 this must have seemed like a great idea at the time,"cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor". the problem is his range is all the way from a to b.   this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many "chance" happenings. in the end all we get is this "thriller"(and i use the term very loosely)that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling 
 This book claims to be written in a large font, however the font is barely larger than the paperback edition.  The large print edition is at most 2 points larger than the paperback, maybe a 12 or 13 point font.  What makes this book bigger is the extra space at the bottom of the page which is not all that usefull for making notes.  This edition is poorly laid out for enjoyable reading and useful notation.  Don't waste you money to get this so called "large print" edition, you should probably just buy the regular sized one.  
 This was the first Tami Hoag novel for me, and it will be my last. After reading such great reviews I expected more from this veteran author. What promised to be a murder mystery was, in fact, no mystery at all. After the first couple of chapters I had surmised "who done it," and by mid-novel I had wrapped up the rest of the so-called loose ends. This detective story is Mickey Spillane gone very long and very predictable 
 I think Twista wanted to run with the success of Slow Jamz from his Kamikaze album and make a new album with that formula.  What he didn't realize that just because that song was good, the rest of his Kamikaze album was diverse and had a lot of substance.  This time around, he just released a straight R&B album, save a few tracks.  There is barely any Twista that we've grown to know.  I can understand if he wanted to put one or two songs on there for the ladies, but practically the whole album?! Come on man, it's like Danny Devito starring in a romance movie.  He needs to stick with what he's good at.  Let's hope his next album will be more of the Twista that we've known in the past with hard beats and fast flows that didn't have 95% R Kellyish lyrics. 
 This book is actually worse than Lahaye's deeply disturbing and nonsensical "Rapture" series because it masquerades under the guise of "scholarship."  Of course the book it claims to be analyzing can only be proven true by refrencing passages in that book that claim that its true.  So, borrowing a tactic from our all knowing Heavenly Furher Jesus:  THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS TRUE: Christians are full of **** and shouldn't be allowed to publish books.  You read it so it must be true 
 Its amazing with all the resources of 911 Commission at their disposal, they could not find an operational link between Hussein and al Qaeda. If the Commission could only get the Bush/Cheney team to testify under oath, there wouldn`t even be a debate.  Perhaps Hayes should spend time reading their final  report which claimed there was no link between Iraq and 911. But Hayes like his other conservative peers have a gift of throwing half truth and innuendo at their faith based readers to come to ludicrous conclusions.   
 Baldacci takes a hard political turn to the left in his latest thriller. Unfortunately, his politics drive an extremely implausible plot--imagine suicide jihadists using disabling darts instead of bullets against their targets? As always, he builds up the suspense well, but the reader is left to snicker at many of the characters, their motivations and Baldacci's bald anti-american, pro-arab/muslim political views. If he continues on this LeCarre-like journey, I won't waste my time with his future offerings 
 especially when there's a pretty girl invovled but this is just dreadful. the songs are so cheesy, her voice is out of place in half the songs. it's whiny, irritating, dull and at this point, I'm not sure who's more talented, her or her sister. they got the looks, sure, but there's lots of pretty girls in this world, doesn't mean they deserve a singing contract just to look hot on the cover of the cd. & that's the only thing that intrigued me to listening to this album. & I'm sorry Jes, but maybe u really are as brain dead as people say 
 First of all, this album mirrors Bright Eyes in so many ways, it's almost ridiculous. He sings about photographs, NBC, drinking. Bright Eyes song Old Soul Song is all about developing a photograph. Let's Not Sh** Ourselves has Conor yelling about NBC, ABC, and CBS (two of which An Angle has in Change The World) and Bright Eyes sings about drinking in about 1/4 of his songs. Also, Kris has mastered the Bright Eyes singing style. This is not a negative thing, it's just very similar.   But as for the album itself, minding the bright eyes comparision, it is about 3 miles away from a masterpiece. That being said, at least it's on the road to a masterpiece, albeit far far away. Songs like True Love and A Way With Words are fantastic and shine on the album. Songs like White Horses and Green Water have an strong energy and really keep you interested in what else Kris has to offer. But too many songs just leave the listener bored and asking "when is he going to stop singing about getting drunk?" Songs like Born in a Bottle and Angry Drunk are pretentiously long and lyrically boring. Going back to Bright Eyes, the only reason that songs like The Big Picture work is because the lyrics are so brilliant. Kris doesn't have this lyrical ability yet.   However, I am excited about the future of An Angle. I think in the next coming years if Kris can mature a little, both musically and lyrically, he'll make an album that's brilliant. An album like Bright Eyes' "I'm Wide Awake It's Morning" (which I believe is his best). Maybe he should just lay off the drinking. 
 I could only make it halfway through this boring book.  It's too bad too because it had potential.    Recommendation to the author, try an write like a writer not a sports columnist.    The style gets old very fast and takes away from the substance of what should be a great look into the NFL 
 This book is totally useless.  I've contacted several places listed in the book to no avail.  This will NOT help you make money and does not lead to any "free" money anywhere.  Keep the money you have 
 I thought this would be fun to read to (and eventually with) my four year old step-grandchild until I flipped through the pages.  Boy, was I wrong!  The drawing that accompanies the first poem, "About The Teeth of Sharks" was entirely inappropriate for a young child--better suited for the movie "Jaws."  I could have just avoided that page, but then I kept flipping through...hidden at the back of the book were poems that treated corporal punishment as a normal and acceptable way of bringing up a child, for example "How the Frightful Child Grew Better," and "What Do You Think His Daddy Did."  
 One start , for some very acurate dramatic and terrorific  facts about the Ebola, but very weak regarding origin of the virus, very unconvincing about possible "theories". sound more like that old music of desinformation, he almost blame another monkey for the Ebola like they did before with HIV.. 
 This is a definitely a disposable vacuum. The hose is too thin so it gets clogged alot, and motor burns out 1 month on usage at most! Don't wast your money 
 The reviews on this book were so positive that i was so looking forward to reading A Family Daughter.  But, i was nothing short of disappointed... the first half kept me going, but the second half was silly and uninteresting.  In a nutshell... don't waste your valuable reading time with this novel- it is sure to be flat and forgettable 
 I used this book in my college and was entirely lost.  And in my opinion not just me but other students at my school.  I believe this is not a good book at all.  First off I find the author dwells way too much into the math for an introductory subject, and as a result makes it really impossible to answer the questions at the end of the chapters.  It seems this book is more for someone who has had a couple years of experience.  You never get a real feel for what the whole topic of microelectronics is and what is the point of the op-amp and transistors.  After trying to read this book several times I started to realize maybe it was not me and maybe it was the book.  And after trying out different books out there I realized it was not me!!!  Now I can say when I first read this book I was not great at electric circuit analysis, but after getting good at that and coming back to this book I was still as confused as I was in college.  I would recommend Microelectronic Circuit Design by Jaeger or Introduction to Electronic Circuit Design by Richard Spencer and Mohammed S. Gaussi.  This book really lowered my confidence in myself, but luckly their are other books out there that make you believe that any subject can be learned and it is not about intellectual aptitude as it is more just of effort.  I would also strongly, strongly, strongly suggets reading Roland Thomas "The Analysis and Design of Linear Circuits" to understand circuit analysis.  This book is amazing and gave me confidence again that I could learn electronics.  The way this author goes over thevinin and norton, node-voltage analysis, phasors, laplaces equations, fourier series, and solving differential equations is amazing!!!!!  And it is an excellent, excellent start to learning the math of electronics.  It actually has problems that are worked out in the book!!!  And it has not just difficult questions but also questions that are easy to get you warmed up.  You almost start to feel you are in high school again, the good old days when math and science was actually easy!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Also the other thing about this book that I did not like was that the book was not fun to read.  I never got excited reading this book.  It is really amazing to me that this is the book of choice not only in colleges but the work place as well.    If you are having problems try reading the other books I have mentioned, and then see.  The one thing that is good about this book is that it shows you basically everything you need to know about electronics, but unfortunately I found you can't learn any of it by reading this book.  I could safetly say you could read this book several times months upon months and maybe understand .01% of it.  
 Describing the Democratic Party as the "party of death" is classic phony-con propaganda designed to attract attention without engaging in intelligent debate.  The notion that the Republican Party is "pro-life" is one of the greatest scams ever perpetrated on the American public.  Republicans support the death penalty, and the Iraq war which has caused the deaths of thousands of Americans and thousands of non-combatant Iraqi civilians.  As governor of Texas, George W. Bush presided over more state-sponsored executions than any governor in the history of the United States.  This included people who were determined by medical experts, unanimously, to be mentally retarded and incapable of understanding their actions or the punishment that awaited them.  So much for respecting life.  It is also a blatant lie to claim that abortion is the central theme of the Democratic Party.  Democrats stand for freedom of choice in all aspects of life.  They stand for the rights of individuals to live their lives without interference from an unchecked government and religious zealots.  That is the fundamental premise on which the United States was founded.  Anyone who wants to understand the true impact of legalized abortion, without a lot of hateful name-calling, should read Freakonomics by Levitt & Dubner.  Let thinking, feeling, Americans consign Ponnuru to the garbage-can where he belongs 
 This book is the literary manifestation of sexual repression and malformation. Coherent stories, decent prose, actual plot and character development, but all in support of repressed bestiality. Though non-furries will find it readable and perhaps even enjoyable as fiction, the true reason behind each and every one of these stories is furthering the spread of the mental abhoration that is furrydom.  Do not support this book or any of its benefactors 
 Sting (of whom I think very well as a musician in his own terms) has given a step into the early baroque-lute-song reperoire of great composer John Dowland... Too bad for him. There are plenty of better choices (almost everyone that exists) for this music... I belive most of the people who will buy and listen this CD do not have any idea of how this music must be sung., and most of them must be fans of the singer... Well, good for them because they will have the opportunity to hear a great composer and some of the most touching music per voice and lute... but ror the rest of us... this cd is just a fiasco 
 I bought this book after reading that it was supposed to be a good source of simple easy to prepare meals.... NOT! The ingredients are tough to find and the fancy recipes aren't at all close to "everyday cooking".  You'll have more chest pain trying this book than a whole case of deep-fried cheesesticks could ever cause 
 This book is horrible.  It is not true to the original classic stories!  Most of the endings, of the stories I've read so far, are different. I don't care for the illustrations either.  I was very dissapointed.  I bought this for my neices, and didn't read the book until they came to visit me, and by then it was too late to return this book. It's basically going in the trash 
 I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful 
 This book is downright terrible. It seems as though it was written by several different people, none of whom communicated with one another and none of whom had a very good handle on physics. There are gaping errors in chapters and AP tests, and the practice AP tests are extremely confusing and misleading- something the actual AP test is not 
 This charger does not work with my Ipod Nano. I have even tried different usb cables and leaving it charging for hours. No result. Nice price, but it doesn't work 
 Not only are the things listed in this book cheap trinkets but most everything in the book you have to pay $1.00 or $2.00 for. The stuff you do not have to pay shipping for are useless pamphlets and literature. There are a few things that are pretty cool and possibly some useful information for some folks but most everything is Junk. Plus a lot of the things listed are repeated through the book. Its like the author needed to add stuff and thought nobody would notice that several of the things were repeated. Overall this 31 page booklet was not worth the paper it was printed on. If you are interested in getting free things I would suggest finding "freebie" message boards on the internet 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 Errors in both text and involved mathematics make this book a horrible waste of my money.  I see this as, "lets fix one error on each edition, and continue selling the heck out of it to university students."  Well, at least West Virginia University will no longer use this one 
 This author has one heck of a writing style. It's all over the place!  He appears to be a well informed guy, but he's very hard to follow. He uses lots of dashes, parentheses, and notes about other chapters. Plus, there are many overuses of words such as "insofar" and "per se," which disrupt the entire flow of reading. It is not what I expected at all and am pretty disappointed 
 This movie is just so tragically non-believable, that it irritates the viewer and you have to quit on it.   Good cast, but what stupidity in the script. Are they serious letting us believe that a serial killer is re-enacting crimes from an almost 100-year old novel.  And so Angelina Jolie goes to a decades abandoned meatpacking storehouse and can still smell the manure??????  Duhhh --- the place has been abandoned for decades. More non-believably, you mean to tell me a real estate developer hasn't snatched up the property and razed the building. That it has sat undisturbed so that even the manure is intact decades later?  I'm sorry -- when movies use plot devices so amateursishly like this, I bail on the whole project. 
 I purchased two ten packs of Lenmar batteries.  Of the twenty batteries, only 4 would take a charge.  I used 3 different chargers, an Energizer, LaCrosse, and a RipVan100.  The LaCrosse is a high-end charger with diagnostics (can display voltage levels, etc., individually for each battery, it can also 'repair' batteries maximum capacities, etc. - so can the RipVan100)...  None could charge the 16 faulty batteries.  I sent both 10 packs back 
 its okay.  looks and feels cheaply made, however.  my torso is long and it comes to right blow my belly button 
 THe complete fat flush program is an impossibility for most. The time it takes to shop for, prepare, and consume would be a full time job. Not to mention that you are suppose to drop everything to search out all "organic" meats, veggies and even juice! I did learn some interesting facts about how to increase bile production.  Just add some lemon to your water, cut back on your portions and enjoy life 
 This review concerns the original 1932 edition and the revised edition published in the 1960's.  Both books follow the same plot; although, the revised edition is slightly different from the original.  While returning from a carnival, Nancy, George and Bess witness a large home suddenly burst into flames.  Thinking that there may be someone trapped inside, the girls rush to the house to help.  They are unable to enter the home because of the heat, but Nancy spots a man running away from the house and later finds a diary, written in Swedish, which contains numerous technical drawings.  Did the man start the fire?  Does the diary belong to him?  And what became of Felix Raybolt, the owner if the home, who apparently has gone missing?  Clues lead Nancy to suspect that the diary belongs to the husband of a poor woman that Nancy met at the carnival along with her little girl.  Nancy becomes determined to prove that Joe Swenson didn't start the fire, but all of the clues she uncovers seem to suggest that he is guilty.  Personally, I didn't find this book very good; there isn't much action, the mystery isn't very exciting and the book really lacks a true criminal.  Thankfully, the writing style used in the book is rather enjoyable, so it keeps the book from being a complete waste of time.  One thing to note about this book is that this is the volume where Nancy meets Ned Nickerson and oddly enough her first thought of him is that he is trying to steal her car!  This book is worth reading for the writing, but its not likely that many fans of Nancy Drew will find this book to be one of their favorites 
 It was impossible to screw the table legs securely to the table top without stripping the heads on half of the 8 bolts.  They just wouldn't go in far enough.  Nice quality wood, but useless if it can't be assembled following their instructions.  
 I have subscribed to Discover magazine for years but have recently cancelled my subscription.  The magazine, which once served up well written news of present and future science has become a hack rag.  From juvenile sexual humor and associated photos couched under the guise of science to supposed factual articles that seem ripped from my local papers Op-Ed page, the whole magazine has degraded into a worthless pile of trash 
 Doyles section is basically the same and is why it got 2 stars in the first place. I feel the poker pros were not used properly for this book. Daniel negranu is a coward for  doing three card draw that has no merit on real card tables and he should of just declined it in the first place,he is a no limit and omaha 8 or better expert and should of wrote on that instead. Bobby baldwin was the most sound poker player during his time, kind of like alan cunningham of today. So I dont know why he didnt write the limit chapter again,  I think modern day limit players would have really been in for a treat. I have nothing against jeniffer harmen writing it but I think it was better served for baldwin. Please save your money and dont buy this book. If need be they should have it at your local library 
 $100 for a casserole dish?  You have got to be kidding.  I don't care how good it is.  For $100 it better load itself up, walk itself over to the oven, turn it on and get in.  I pity anyone who buys this.  $100 is bad enough but look at it.  What's wrong with cookware that looks like cookware 
 Alice in Wonderland meets Stephen King. When a mysterious blue light enters the souls of a variety of people, good and bad, they receive powers and knowledge beyond this world--whatever gifts they have are made even stronger. But then...strange things start to happen.   The colorful characters, deep symbolism and surreal scenarios make this book a unique thriller with a conclusion that leaves you wondering where fantasy began and reality ended.   Some of the details were a little gory for me and generally overall it was disappointing--maybe because of his venture into Sci-Fi. The info on the back cover enticed me to read it, but alas, I really fought hard to get through this book and decide what I felt about it.   Overall his characters were thinly developed and the story ended abruptly--and I felt, with a bit more effort, could have improved the total results. Maybe I had different expectations because of who the author is--and his reputation with the mystery genre and his Easy Rawlins stories.   Armchair Interviews says: This writer changed genre, and seemed to miss the mark for many SciFi fans.     
 I thought the book was sometimes engaging with a number of interesting perspectives and anecdotes.  But the "Art of the Pilgrimage" chapter was not constructive. The author seemed to completely ignore the environmental impact of some "environmental art." He raves about creating "lush green pastures" without considering the negative impact of such excessive consumption on deserts and other fragile habitats. I was especially offended by his assertion that art is better appreciated by traveling as much as possible - actually art and life are better appreciated by cultivating a responsible attitude toward consumption and environmental impact. It made me appreciate Manet even more: 'A painter can say all he wants to with fruit or flowers or even clouds . . . .' 
 It works great when it's charged, but keeping a charge is difficult. I experienced the same as a previous review - even with a full charge it drains very quickly when being used - no more than 5 minutes. 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
  The last time that I wrote up one of Martha Grimes books (Belle Ruin) I mentioned that I thought that her move to America and possibly her getting a new editor had greatly improved her books. I said that I was looking forward to future improvements to her style and plot development.  It is obvious that Martha has decided to fire the new editor and has gone back to her old ways of inserting meaningless chapters into her books for the purpose of enlarging their size. These inserts are supposed to be humorous I gather. They are not. She has also decided that she wants to court the people of Hollywood who are looking for books with little or no plot for them to convert into the pabulum of the mindless. There are no car chases in this book, however the main character and the gorgeous (naturally) police DI seem to jump into bed every time that they meet on the street or at a crime scene.  I am sorry that I gave Martha another chance.  It is my impression that Martha thinks that this is a mystery. I think my catagory of "Humor" is what she really attempted and failed.  It is really unfortunate because she has shown that she has the ability to put together a gripping mystery tale if she ever wants to. 
 I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.   While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.   He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them. 
 I used to listen the Dream Theater "back in the day" so I thought I'd check them out.  I can't believe how bad this CD is.  Am I glad I didn't pay full price for this.  What a boring, pretentious pice of crap 
 This is a remake of An Affair to Remember with Cary Grant and Deborah and it does not work. Some movies just should not be remade. The ONLY thing good about this movie is Katharine Hepburn's appearance. Get the original 
 How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding 
 While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.  And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet?  A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??  I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say "She's BACK! 
 This fluffy take on the human element of DoCoMo's success will not teach you anything about the wireless industry in Japan or the U.S. and hardly poses as a model or case study for anything related to strategy or how to "become a global force". Check out the market cap for DoCoMo in the last year and a half and look at the value and return in their overseas' investments and you will see why DoCoMo is a typical example of floundering, conservative Japanese management styles that aren't taking the world like a tsunami, but trickling in with little or no impact. Global competitors look at DoCoMo's business model as something to emulate, but their weak strategy and feet dragging business style make them a bloated telecom giant wasting away shareholder value. This books talks nothing of that and merely goes on and on about the success of i-mode, which would be relatively interesting if you hadn't read about it ten times in Business Week or Forbes Magazine in the last two years. NOTE: We used DoCoMo as a case study in my Japanese business school and despite all sorts of flowery talk about the creation and success of i-Mode, nearly every member of the class was critical of this company's overall global strategy 
 Werner Keller was a journalist who was enamored with biblical studies and turned his attention to archeology as a result of the burgeoning area in the late 40s (Dead Sea Scrolls, Nag Hammadi, etc.). The result was this book wherein Keller unashamedly declares - "The Bible is right after all." (p. xviii). He then proceeds to show us.  The book itself is well written and shows more than a little scholarship. He covers 4000 years of biblical history and he tries to integrate archeology with bible quotes and reference works, mostly from the 19th Century.  Yet the book is deeply flawed by Keller's desire to have everything validate the bible's positions. For example, he tries to show that Luke's dating of the census was not entirely incorrect since Quirinius had been in Palestine sometime "between 10 and 7 BC" (p. 344). Yet every scholar who has studied the issue claims that the census in 6 AD was the first census, so Quirinius' presence in Palestine in 8 BC is irrelevant. He spends an exhaustive amount of time detailing the history of the "Star of Bethlehem" and "proving" that the wise men would have arrived to see Jesus in December 7 BC. Then in the next breath he concludes that Jesus must have been born "before the onset of winter" (p. 354). In no case does he seem to realize that the "wise men", if they existed at all, came 2 years after Jesus' birth which is why Herod had all the children, 2 years or younger, slain. Or consider his remarks about the "one-time splendid synagogue" (p. 364) found in Capernaum. In fact, what is there is a public bulding of some sort, but there is no evidence that it was a synagogue until the 3rd Century.  You know that anyone who refers to Josephus as a "trusty historian" (p. 356) hasn't really done his homework.  It's a shame that Keller's theologically biases make a lot of the material unusable. This book can be dangerous if read by a person who is unable to separate fact from theology. Which is unfortunate because it does have a lot of good information and it is well written 
 Only a short way into this book, I quickly realized General Clark wrote the book himself without the help of a ghost writer.  It appears he also lacked the help of a good editor. The story jumps around from thought to thought without solid editorial orginization.  Aside from the poor organization of the book, the content has some shortcomings as well.  It is extremely self serving and bears little objectivity.  I found it disturbing to read that Clark viewed his role as Commander of NATO more seriously than his role as a United States Army Officer.  He does not atempt to hide the fact that he entered the US into a war directly against the wishes of his civilian superior.  This book makes it clear why Secretary Cohen and General Shelton are not supporting his bid for President and question his integrity.  Due to his presidential bid this book is being removed from the Army's Command and General Staff reading list.  This is unfortunate despite its poor style because the book serves as a cautionary tale of the possibility to abuse the powers currently resting in the US military unified command structure 
 The book was about a girl named Jennifer and a toad that she bought from a magic shop for a school  project about pets.   The only thing she did not know about the toad was that the toad,bufo, could talk.   I would recomend this book to people who like Fairy tales , or books with  magic. The characters in this story are Jennifer ,Ellen, Mr Elives, Sharra, Skippy, Brandon,Mrs.Murdley, and Bufo the toad.   My opinion of this story was that it was not so good but ok. I thought the book was boring 
 I Have been a Commission fan for many, many years. When I came accross this CD I became very excited.  Here were the original members of my beloved COMMISSIONED, back together again, and performing all of my favorite tunes! Of course I bought it.  However, I must say that I am somewhat disapointed. Perhaps its the fact that the songs were recorded live in concert.  My favorite songs did not minister to me in the same way as the individual CD's had in the past.  It was as if the new lead singer was trying the "Out-Do" the original members. As if he were trying to make his mark.  On many of his solo vocal spots, he was yelling out the lyrics and not blending with the others. This was a major "turn off".  In retrospect, I feel that I should have purchased a greatest hits type CD format. Peace 
 Writing fiction is like painting a landscape. A lot of artists can do it, and each one has an individual way they do it. It is the same with writing. Many people have written good novels; each one approaches it differently. So when someone like Ray Robert tells you how it's done, don't believe him. I'm not saying that his method doesn't work for him. What I am saying is it probably won't work for you. (It didn't work for me.) You have to figure out what works for you. Check out Immediate Fiction by Jerry Cleaver. You won't regret it 
 Esquire is a subpar Men's magazine, in my opinon.  More than half of the magazine is advertisements, and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking.  If you like ads and cologne samples, pick it up.  After all, it is pretty decently priced 
 The essence of the book is "corporations behave badly".  I happen to agree but I don't need 339 pages to tell me this.  I was hoping to learn something here.  I was hoping for some history of how corporations developed.  Nothing of the kind.  Just a comparison to the gilded age (late 1800s) repeated throughout the book that is obvious to anyone who knows American history.  Those liberals who love to read long winded tirades that support their point of view may enjoy this book.  But if you aren't a liberal or if you are a liberal with a brain, this book will bore you to tears 
 If MTV was smart, and they used to be, along with funny, relevant, and entertaining (they even played music videos all the time!) It was on all day in my house, and you could always count on the VJs passing along some wacky facts, or artists dropping by who could actually speak coherently. Anyway, MTV could make their massive video catalog available to the public. You could browse online and choose the videos you wanted, pay $2-$3 each and MTV would either create a custom DVD for you and send it out, or you could download them and make your own DVDs. I would gladly pay to have several DVDs that contained only the videos I wanted. And there are about 100 I want, just off the top of my head.   As it is, I am happy to watch my old and fading copies made back then and occasionally catch an old great on VH1 Classic, rather than have someone else pick out 10 videos, 4 of which I may want, the rest I don't. This one did nothing for me. Luckily it was a gift. I never would've bought it for myself 
 I read this book back in 2003 and I did not write a review about it. Only recently I was reminded of how much I hated it and I was compelled to write one now. The character is boring and the plot is non existent. Spare yourself the misery and don't read this book. 
 d item was not fo me but d bits and pieces ive seen of d show r really gud and if ur n 2 d hole prison ting den dis is a gud 1 2 go fo 
 The first illustrated story about the scrambled states keeps your interest, but the two other illustrations are totally musical, the songs are too long, and get boring.  Doesn't hold your interest.  Not one of Scholastics' better videos 
 This is NOT a high-end luxury towel by Grand Patrician and is not ultra in ANY way. Even if they were firsts, they are second rate. Mine started to self-destruct after the first wash, and never had the absorbency of a wet dish rag.  Am disappointed Amazon would carry this product, which would be a bad deal at half the price. Next time I will look for more reviews 
 I was initially very excited about this book after reading other reviews, knowing my pink-loving 3 year old would be excited, too.  However, after reading the book myself I was quite disappointed.  The book describes how a little girl that loves pink gets whatever her heart desires (dress, tights, headband, sunglasses, painted room & ceiling, bedding, rug, toys, birthday party, gifts, etc. all in pink, of course) until her mom can't find her in all of the pink.  Only then does the little girl miss some other colors.  But this is only one page of the book, after page after page of all these things she wants and gets in pink.  At the end, when the mother finds her she gets a big red kiss, and it ends with "Madison loved red...", as if to indicate the whole scenario all over again.  Does she then love red so much that she gets whatever she wants in red?  Seems to me the author missed another important lesson.  Besides the fact that there are other colors in the world to enjoy besides your favorite, there also could have been a lesson about getting whatever you want (like everything pink) isn't always a good thing.  I'm not even sure I want to read this book to my daughter for fear that she'll think it's ok to have everything she wants (pink or otherwise.)  
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck.   Re: J Czecholinski  Hey J, you couldn't be more wrong! Your review is as flawed as Lahaye and Jenkin's unbiblical writing. First, I am a Christian who does believe that Jesus is coming back, but I do not believe He is coming back in a secret, silent rapture that the LEFT BEHIND series is making millions of Christians believe. I believe in the verse you used (to try and prove me wrong), which is 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 : 'For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout,with the call of the archangel,and with the trumpet call of God. First,all the Christians who have died will rise from the graves.Then,together with them,we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and remain with Him forever.' When Jesus comes back, we will know it. Keys words being COMMANDING SHOUT and TRUMPET CALL OF GOD. We're not going to be zapped up while others are standing around for 7 years. In the Bible, 7 years refers to completeness or totality, which is time until Jesus comes back for good. Lahaye and Jenkins are taking figurative language from John's revelation and making them literal and adding their own spin to sell books and make movies. This adding to Scripture and polluting the word of God makes me think of Galatians 1:6-9 which says: "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!" This is what Lahaye and Jenkins are doing: perverting the gospel with their own spin. And your "belief" in the anti-Christ is incorrect as well (along with Lahaye and Jenkins). Check out these verses: 1st John 2:22 "Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son." or 1st John 4:3 "...but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world." Key words their being EVEN NOW IS ALREADY IN THE WORLD. This is referring to SATAN who was in the world in John's day and still in the world. The Bible says in 1st John 2:18 that many anti-Christs have come and anti-Christ is anyone who is against Christ. There are many people who are persecuting the Church and Christians (as this is the last days that we are living - check out 2nd Timothy 3). Why are we looking for somebody like Nicholae when there are already those who have the spirit of the Anti-Christ? Why are polluting the word of God to try and sell books and movies. Why are we allowing ourselves to be eternally condemned because we are starting to follow this new type of thinking? Do you think that the disciples, when Jesus ascended to heaven, thought that there would be a silent rapture followed by tribulation? No! Finally, you said that 2nd Corinthians 6:2 says: "TODAY is the day of salvation I'm looking SO forward to that day when the Lord will come for me and all born again believers that we won't HAVE to endure the tortures during the Tribulation." What bible version are you looking at. 2nd Corinthians 6:2 clearly states: "For he says, 'In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.' I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation." Nothing about Tribulation and nothing about enduring tortures!!! You are just making up Scripture, perverting the GOSPEL! Now verse 4 talks about troubles (lower-case "t"), hardships, distresses, etc. That is happening now, today until Jesus comes back with a commanding shout and trumpet call of God to take us to heaven and those against him into eternal judgement - no 7 year tribulation period!!! Live today like it was your last day, because you could die or Jesus could come back (and believe me, you will know it because until you can show me verses where a silent, secret rapture will take place and there will be those left behind battling for seven years, I will continue to follow the God-breathed word of God and not fluff of Lahaye and Jenkins. "Tribulation" is found once in the bible (Rev 7:14 NIV) and it is with a lower-case "t" and has nothing to do about what the books suggest. "Rapture" never appears as this is a word that hasn't been around that long. So in summary, Jesus is coming back and we will know about it (whether you are a Christian or not). And off the subject, yes, baptism is essential to becoming a Christian and being saved (not praying Jesus into your heart)...it seems that the same people who believe in Lahaye's rapture are usually wrong on that issue as well. Please do yourself a favor. Read the Bible and follow it. If you do that, then you won't be led astray by these false teachings of someone like J. Czecholinski who cannot even get his Scriptures straight!  Follow the teachings of God 
 I was disappointed at this book. It exaggerates the issues about women. I would say, it does have a few good points. Definitely, I have read better books than this 
 There is a little secret that people should be aware of before watching this film. The rationale for the war was not that the US wished to bring civilisation to the Iraqi nation and to end the atrocities this film deals in. It was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that it would use against the West if these were not dismantled. The war was waged even though the weapons inspectors could find no weapons. After the war, the victors found no weapons of mass destruction. And so the case for a war in which, according to the Lancet, 100,000 people lost their lives, was manufactured.    Here's another secret. If someone lies to you once, they will do it again. I suggest that people should view this stuff, if they must, with extreme scepticism. No one would claim that these atrocities never happened. Of course they did. If you go to chop-chop square in Saudi Arabia on any Friday, you'll see this form of justice dispensed, as it has been for the past 1000 years. Question the accuracy of these claims, and the motivation behind the claims and ask yourself whether, yet again, we are being manipulated. One thing is certain, if you believe that what you see in this film justifies the war against Iraq, consistency demands that we attack Saudi Arabia immediately. 
 I love Kate Bush, I have had a couple of albums in the past and was looking to get some in my collection of CDs. Unfortunately "A Sensual World" didnt really gel with me, very esoteric and hard to understand and empathise with 
 Okay if you want an idea of what this new series is all about picture a bunch of hi-tech hippies with super powers in space. Well that's the feeling it gave me at least. I mean there is this big social movement called the Legion that most parents despise as being a bad influence on society and the kids all think the adults don't get it and only they have the answers. And society is sterile and individuality is frowned upon. Sounds like a hippie rehash of the sixties to me. For me this trade just didn't have any kind of spark to it at all. Just a bunch of disfunctional future heroes arguing with each other.  
 I received this subscription as a trial, and found it one of the most boring publications that I have ever read.  By the last few issues that I got, I wasn't even looking at the pictures anymore.  There are drawn-out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life, which were very materialistic.  At the end of every issue there were pictures of "real-life" wedding announcements.  Perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper, but it struck me as out of place in a magazine 
 Sounds up to date, and I bought it thinking it new, but tired forecasts from 1990 can easily be beaten by anyone of average thinking from the vantagepoint of 2000. Avoid and think for yourself instead 
 A to Z has a big problem in my opinion. It is a very simple children's book with some very cute illustrations of animals (A to Z).  Each animal is engaged in an action that also begins with the first letter of it's name  (e.g. Kangaroos Kissing).  There are lots of made up animals, I'm assuming  to account for the rarity of animals beginning with "Q" and  "X" etc.  The part that I don't like is the fictitious  "Uglybirds" whose action is simply "Being Ugly".  The  illustration that goes along with this so-called ugliness is very  disturbing.  The "Uglybirds" have atypical bird features that  seem intentional.  They are green and purple, and have messed up feathers  and big bulging eyes and are very "Different" from the  "normal" birds in this and other books.  Upon reading this, my  wife and I agreed that we would never repeat this section while reading to  our daughter.  Although I do intend on teaching my daughter about ugliness  (Racism, Violence, contempt, etc.).  I think that it is a quality that  shouldn't be used to describe physical appearance.  When my daughter  encounters a person who is physically unusual, I hope that I have instilled  in her the values to disregard what others might find "Ugly".  I  know that some might think that I'm overanalyzing such an innocent entry in  a child's book, I think that parents need to be more careful about the  messages that they are sending about ugliness 
 Do not bother! Cena does not have the potential of the Rock or even Kane for that matter. They are just trying to make more money off of the uneducated wrestling fan 
 I've owned several Toshiba televisions over the years, and the one striking feature they all had was solid build quality, and excellent reception and picture quality.  Not so with this model.  Even with an amplified VHF/UHF antenna, and living in a major metro area, reception is subpar on many channels.  The picture jumps a lot (doesn't sync), and is subject to image ghosting.  This is a shame because the DVD player, and DVD picture quality is excellent.  So, this unit is indeed a 'mixed blessing'.  Look elsewhere for a quality 13" TV/DVD combo unit.  UPDATE: 12/24/06; As of yesterday, I discovered that this DVD player will NOT play several DVD's I fed it!  I had purchased some educational DVD's for my toddler, and out of the 6, it only plays 4.  It turns out that this DVD player is in fact a P.O.S.  Stay away from this subpar TV 
 What a waste of time, you knew all along what was going to happen and the characters are all just a little too perfect to be normal and believable.   Some things are totally out there... for exapmle, Allegra is woken up in the middle of the night to bail her client out of jail? Come on! Lawyers are not ethically permited to post bail for their clients. Do some research Danielle, like the rest of the authors do... don't rely on what you see on television. No lawyer would ever give out their home number, let alone answer calls in the middle of the night.   And I am sick and tired of this obsession this author has with thinness. A size 10 is fat? Women like to read about characters who they can relate to and are like themselves... not the ideal woman created by the male world.   Don't waste time on this book, unless you are still in high school.  
 This is something for a new manager with little experience in not only systems administration but supervision.  This book may give a clue to someone who has just stepped into such a position but provides little depth and direction.  Unfortunately, there isn't any one book out there as management is a very complex role that encompasses many disciplines, any one of which would be a volume in itself.  I was very dissappointed and I find the other reviews misleading 
 This book's purpose is to argue that Wal-mart is an evil empire.  Fishman throws in some positive facts to try and seem neutral, but throughout the book he shows his socialist stripes and lack of understanding of basic economic principals.  The sections of the book that I most enjoyed and found most interesting were the great in-depth anecdotes about companies that have a relationship with Wal-Mart.  I had trouble finishing this book because his diatribe against Wal-Mart becomes more intense near the end, but at the same time his arguments have so many gaping holes.  Those who understand basic economic principles will shake their head in disagreement many times as they turn the pages of this book.  Overall, I feel quite dismayed because I think he will be successful in convincing many uninformed readers that Wal-Mart's impact is more harmful than beneficial. 
 Who published these weak translations?  Yup, they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately.  How about using real paper?  B&N needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality 
 I had to read this book for a history class in college, and I must say it was a poor choice for the class.  The author throws out many obscure names, and expects you to know who they.  He goes on and on about the authors of the period and their respective eccentricities.  The reader is treated to countless pages about who so-and-so was friends with, and what tea party they attended that evening.  It simply fails to help the reader appreciate this remarkable period in America's history 
 This version of the books is filled with typos. The CORRECTED version of the book is available at Amazon. Simply use the search engine to locate the new version # 1887938958. I would not recommend buying this book simply because is has far too many typos in it. I would strongly recommend buying the new version of the same book. 
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.  
 The book is chock full of examples and anecdotes but really has no new worthwhile conceptualizations or insights to make it worth reading.  If you don't know anything about database marketing, then you will get something out of this book.  If you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis, loyalty programs and relationship marketing, there is nothing new here.  In fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is The Loyalty Effect by Reichenheld or Customer Connections by Wayland and Cole.  The subtitle mentions the dot com world, but the book has little to say about the Internet.  The book really does not cover CRMs (as oppsed to database marketing) in that it fails describe how CRM systems work and what database, modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them 
 After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.   After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.   We never get closure on Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.  Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."   It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life. 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 It was a confusing book. It was an O.K. book. It was very touching at the end. I liked the part when Jessie helped the people on the boat 
 Huber's argument does not take into account the interconnectedness of nature. To him, if humans cannot see a problem with thier own eyes, it does not exist. This line of thinking is curiously primitive. The perceptive powers of human beings were formed during the evolution of our species, in which survival did not entail managing the Earth's enviromental woes. Survival only entailed the management of enviromental problems in our immediate vacinity. Thus our evolved "astetic" sense of problems in our enviroment is limited to those problems which posed dangers to our species as we evolved. According to Huber only problems sensed by this primitive awareness can be considered real "hard" challenges to the enviroment. All other challenges to the enviroment, sensed by different means (for instance satilite data, computer models, scientific studies) must be classified as "soft" challenges, because they are imperceptable to our evolved senses. This is absolute hogwash!! Humans evolved to live primitive lives on the plains of Africa. Now that we have formed advanced civillizations there are bound to be concepts and problems that we can percieve only through the use of science, computers, or machines, and not with our eyes and ears. Just because mining is underground is imperceptable to humans dosen't mean it cannot have delterious effects upon the ecosystem we depend upon. Just because we cannot see, smell, taste, or hear carbon monoxide pollution dosen't mean its not deadly. This book, at its heart, is a screed against reason that no enviromentalist should take seriously. The author has no training in the enviromental sciences, and is financed by a right-wing think tank. His ideas are only provocative because they go against the grain, not because they make any sense. It's kinda like saying the holocaust never happened. You get attention, but no respect. This man and his screed against reason should recieve niether 
 LDS scholars (most notably Robert Millet) have recently been interested in the life and writings of C.S. Lewis, hoping that perhaps he might provide a bridge from mainstream Christianity to the heterodox LDS church. All this in spite of the fact C.S. Lewis was a staunch Anglican. LDS authors and scholars point to cerain statements Lewis makes, in an attempt to show that their unique doctrines might have had some support from one of Christendom's most beloved thinkers.  This book is one such attempt, and I must say I was surprised at how little it had to offer. Jensen attempts to show that C.S. Lewis could, in fact, have been close to Mormon belief, by listing quotes from his works alongside quotes from prominent LDS leaders. Unfortunately, perhaps 95% of those quotes talk about topics like charity, Christian service, humility, etc., which were not restored at all, but have been an integral part of the Christian tapestry throughout its history. Love is not a uniquely Mormon idea, nor is the worship of God, or the need for works performed in Christian love. Jensen's only chapters on peculiar LDS doctrines contain very little C.S. Lewis (and what Lewis quotes there are seem dubious when examined in context), and instead rely on LDS authorities.  I'm afraid the case that C.S. Lewis would have been LDS (or at least close to it) is still just as lacking as it was before. But I applaud Jensen's attempt, as it is no doubt the best LDS thinkers will be able to do. He demonstrates a wide knowledge and love for Lewis' writings. It's just too bad the message of the writings as a whole is lost in the desperate search for LDS teachings not present in the Lewis corpus 
 This story of a chid id poverty-stricken India was hard to keep reading. The lack of plot put me right to sleep. I got a few chapters in and couldn't finish it. Don't waste your money on this 
  The item was not as it was stated to be which was a disappointment for use in any vehicle.  It does not have a suction cup mount.  It must be fasten with screws.  I made use of in one car.  Do to not being sent what I ordered AS listed in desrciption.  Most likely not buy another product.   Richar 
 This is a classic example of a writer letting the constructs of academic verbage get in the way of his message.  Altman has some solid original ideas about the history and construction of American screen musicals, but  he lets the language get in the way.  He also gets too many little facts  wrong -- for example, he refers several times to Shirley Jones having a  little sister Amarylis in THE MUSIC MAN, but Amarylis was only her piano  student and NOT a relative! Its hard to respect someone who is so sloppy  about research 
 It is seldom that I leave a book without having finished it. It seemed to me to be extremely repetitive. John Self is (ha ha) an egotist advertisement-director Britishman who travels to the US to negotiate his first major film. An alcoholic and drug-addict, Self lives obssesed with a woman who cheats on him on a permanent basis. He gets drunk so many times it stops being funny. Amis can write and has a good sense of humor, but the story goes nowhere. Maybe other books by him are better 
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 the book the color purple is a very good book.The book is kind of hard to understand because of the way that they talk. The book is about a girl  name celie and she and she was the oldest out of her sisters so she was picked 2 marry a guy and that guy used 2 beat her and rap her. this book make me think about what do i what to be when i grow up and that im going to make more of my self as a black young lady 
 Very disappointing version of this story.  I was hoping to see the actual Horton, animation and all and this was a page turner with a voice attached.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Don't bother 
 I suppose it's alright if you like overlong musicals focusing on maniacal, manipulative mothers 
 It always amazes me how seemingly intelligent people can become so  irrational when it comes to their religious beliefs.  This feeble attempt  to show how new theories in science point to a God is nothing new.  Ontological and cosmological "proofs" for God have been around  for a long time and this book offers nothing new.  I have a PhD in physics  and have met many other scientists and have shared thoughts on this  subject. I must say the editors and sample scientists views are NOT  representative of most.  It seems obvious the editors picked those  scientists who held similar views.  Sure they chose a few token agnostics.   The only way I could recommed this book is for a laugh and the simple  wonder of how the comfort of religion can corrupt even a well disciplined  scientific mind 
 I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!?  The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night.  Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!?  It is not matching the character 
 The Covenant of the Wild is an example of anti-animal rights propaganda masquerading as science. For readers with an interest in this genre, it is worth reading.   Readers with a limited knowledge of natural history or who are unused to careful critical thinking will likely come away with a gross misunderstanding of the history of domestication and a biased view of the animal rights and the environmental movements. It is unclear whether Budiansky sets out to deceive his audience or is just poorly informed.   There is good evidence in the psychology literature that one's early childhood experiences can have a lasting effect on one's outlook. Budiansky explains that he was raised without exposure to animals. This might explain his bias and his projection that no one knows the source of meat or how animals behave other than farmers or hunters. He now feels, after moving to a farm and raising sheep, that he is an expert on animal behavior and animals' desires. Udder nonsense.  In the preface to the 1999 paperback edition, Budiansky writes:  "...we are the only species capable of conceiving of the pain and suffering of another; ... we are the only species capable of understanding the consequences of our actions or our inaction."  Writers in this genre uniformly struggle to name the characteristics that somehow set us apart from other animals and give us a right to hurt them. Budiansky's claim is illustrative of the scientific illiteracy, or selective consideration of evidence that afflicts writers in this area. The premier example of members of other species being aware of, being concerned with, and acting to protect others may the 1964 paper published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, "`Altruistic' Behavior in Rhesus Monkeys." Budiansky must be unaware of the research in this area.  Budiansky sprinkles similar ignorant claims throughout his text. He revisits the claim that monkeys were necessary to the development of the polio vaccine but doesn't mention the fact that in 1984, Albert Sabin, who developed the oral polio vaccine, swore under oath to the U.S. House of Representatives' Subcommittee on Hospitals and Health Care of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs that "the work on [polio] prevention was long delayed by an erroneous conception of the nature of the human disease based on misleading experimental models of the disease in monkeys."  Overall, even if one discounts his factual errors as simple ignorance, his argument that domestic animals were, in some twisted sense, willing participants in our early domestication of them is poorly argued and fraught with internal inconsistency and contradiction. I'm amazed that such gibberish came from the pen of a past editor at the journal Nature, but maybe this helps explain the journal's unwillingness to examine the ethical implications of our discoveries about other animals' minds and emotions.  For anyone other than a student of the anti-animal propaganda, or someone seeking to salve his or her own dislike of progressive views, this book will largely be a waste of time.  
 Never could connect with the main character in this book.  She mostly seems cold and impersonal to me.  She's described as "nice" by other characters in the book, but she's mostly condescending and rude to them, as when she tells the postman to "bugger off" after he tells her "good morning".  Didn't feel any warmth or affection for her family either.  They are superficially drawn and seem to have little connection to each other.  The husband is uninvolved and disinterested in his family's life.  Mostly disagrees with wife on everything.  The village seems lackluster and full of unhappy, discontented people.  Nothing charming or engaging about it to make one feel that it's "cosy".  Bleak and dreary is more like it.  Not much to the story line either.  I figured out the basic plot early on and I am usually the last to know what's going on.  Don't recomend this book at all 
 I haven't received my subscription to Sunset magazine yet.  I can't review the actual magazine, but I can say they are very slow at getting new orders out 
 I've just returned from a luncheon with 5 pastors representing 4 differing theological beliefs.  We discussed this book and came to the consensus:  1.	Process theology is partially an attempt to wrestle with the old question as to how an all-powerful loving God can allow terrible things to happen.  This is a valid question.  2.	This particular book makes too strong of assertions to be helpful to persons without a solid understanding of theology and critical thinking.  It should never be used in a Sunday school class or small group.  3.	This particular book does not build a strong enough foundation for the assertions made by the author.  The author states opinions and builds a theology from those.  This opens the door for circular logic.  This builds a theology of straw.  It should be expanded and deepened before it will be useful for serious study.  4.	The inclusion of a chapter by John B. Cobb, Jr. lends some legitimacy to the work, but while Cobb's theology is similar on the surface, his results are significantly different.  All process theology is not the same.  5.	The author often refers to "traditional theology" yet of the four theological systems represented in our discussion, none of them fit into the author's mold.  Readers should be aware that there is no "one size fits all" Protestant theology.  Now, that I've offered a collective review let me make a suggestion.  The controversial book, GOD OF THE POSSIBLE by Gregory A. Boyd wrestles with some of the same issues presented in this book in a much more thought provoking way.  If you are challenged (or threatened) by the ideas this book wrestles with, read Boyd's book.  Warning: Boyd's book is not safe - it could be threatening! 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 Definately only a book to use to look up names.  not to actually help you find one. You can find this type of alphabetical dictionary set up of names many places online for free 
 This is, without question, the WORST book ever written on one's financial life.  To begin with, it's useless: ZERO information, ZERO new analysis of old information, ZERO advice, ZERO interesting anecdotes.  Additionally, it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data, to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering.  What exactly is this guy's point?   No way to tell.  Seriously, this book is SO BAD that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have, in my opinion, lost all remaining credibility.   What a waste of my $16 and 4 hours.  I want my money and time back. 
 This lab manual is overpriced even by college textbook standards.  It is nicely bound, but made with crap paper.  The labs in it are made overly tedious with extra, uneeded steps to confuse a student.  
 This is a presentation of the possible events that will usher in the reign of the Antichrist.  Key event is a worldwide financial crisis and desperate people in need of a solution.  The solution will be offered by a group of  conspirators, or "money masters."  Countries will no longer have  individual currencies, but a one-world currency will be initiated.       Some of the theories presented involve timelines which have about expired,  there is repetition in thought and ideas, and some of the ideas presented  seem extreme.  Still, it is not possible to dismiss all of the book as  lunacy, and a few of the ideas stick in the mind and raise questions about  what is happening in the world of today and in the United States 
 this phone has constant static and very poor reception, it constantly makes a clicking soun 
 There are only 17 songs in this entire book! NO fiddle music. All the notes are much smaller than all the other books, hard to read. There are finger numbers above all the notes, so you don't learn to read the notes, you read the numbers and make mistakes because you don't know which string you should put the finger on. The accompanying CD is way too fast to play with! The other books give you more to play, to read and contain twice the melodies which are from all different styles.  Just don't get what all the fuss is about with this method if you don't learn to read right and don't play any worthy exercises 
 I've got to agree with a previous review by Jeff, this is a dull book, with no spark, wit or charm. More importantly, it does a rather poor job of introducing the overall concepts of how the software operates and visually composes the website, before it gets into details. Sure, it's important to let people get their feet wet, but the order in which concepts are presented very much matter. Several times during my read, I didn't understand why something I did in chapter 2 worked until I was well into chapter 7. This is like being thrown into playing a game, but not being told the rules until 2/3 of the way through. I'm a big fan of most Dummies books, but not this one 
 Somehow they managed to get beautiful fresh-faced Kate Beckinsdale and lather enough make-up on her to make her a candidate for Madame Tussaud's wax museum. A bit to aggressive with the hair curling thingie didn't help either. No lead had enough "quiet" time in which to establish a character...they had the depth of Playstation 3 people. All the CG monster's just moved too fast. The thing that bothered me the most...1/3 of the film occurs in "dark-o-vision"...it's so dark you can barely discern what is happening. Combine that with the hyper active fight scenes and rapid fire editing...and whole scenes occur that don't involve us simply cause we are confused on what is going on. I would think there could be some frightining scenes, maybe some tension and dread, heck it's got the grand trio of monsters...nope, not here. We've seen enough how movies are made specials that we are bored by CG cartoons. The "face in the sky" ending was embarressing. 
 Poorly written.  Disorganized.  No new information.  Not worth the time it takes to read it... or the price 
 This has got to be one of the worst travel books I have ever come across. It does not cover anything that would not already be obvious if you went to one of the places listed here - like not to miss the Empire State Bldg if you are in NYC or the Eiffel Tower in Paris. On the Swedish section it has the area referred to as all of Southern Sweden mixed up with an island of its east coast. Anyone looking for experiencing something special on their trips should stay far away from this book. I only give it one star because the system does not allow me to put none 
 Wu-Tang Clan has seen better times.  I remember a day when you couldn't help but love everything Wu put out either as a group or individually.  Remember the good ole days of Enter The Wu-Tang, Liquid Swords, Tical, Only Built For Cuban Linx, and Ironman?  Now years later, the outlook for any kind of renaissance is very slim.  Don't get me wrong, Ghostface Killah laid it down with his latest album Fishscale.  But Clifford Smith a.k.a. Method Man is a totally different story.  4:21...The Day After continues the slippery slope that his solo career has been traveling.  There are a few cuts that you might get into like the charismatic "Is It Me" or the posthumous verse of ODB on "Dirty Mef."  You can even accept songs such as the Lauryn Hill assisted "Say,"  the Erick Sermon produced "Gotta Have It," or even "Let's Ride" featuring Ginuwine as being decent.  One thing that's become obvious is the fact that he can't hold it down alone like he did with Tical.  But a bunch of these tracks are missing the entertainment quality that we've become accustom with from Method Man.  I mean, "Somebody Done F*cked Up" has some energy, but the beat is too repetitive and never switches up once.     The majority of 4:21...The Day After is brought down by perplexing production and mudane vocals from both Method and his guest artists.  Streetlife brings his wackness to songs like "4:20" and "Everything" (the latter also features an uninspiring verse from Inspectah Deck.)  And you would think putting Method, Rza, and Raekwon on a track would be a banger, but "Presidential M.C." comes and goes without much fanfare.  Other weak selections include "Konichiwa B*tches," "4Ever" featuring Megan Rochell, and "Fall Out."  I honestly can't see anybody rushing out to get 4:21....The Day After except to complete their Method Man collection.  This album won't get much pub from Def Jam and it seems Method Man is going through the motions at this day in his career.  Everyone had high hopes for Method Man's career...but it seems like the only high he'll be getting is with a blunt. 
 This is a reasonably fun light read which would have improved if it had been edited.  As with many American popular science books, the first third is perhaps worth reading if you're fast, the second third is barely OK, and the last third seems to have gone directly from a first draft written in a word processor to the printed page.   The premise is entertaining- that human intelligence might have evolved as a sexual display - but it's not well supported by evidence. To be fair, the author points this out occasionally in the first third of the book.   I only save books I might like to read or refer to again. This one ended up directly in the wastebasket. 
 Alhthough Polsky has some interesting insights on the art market, they are relatively few, and are separated by numerous pointless anecdotes and even more pointless details.  For example, in describing a visit to a colleague staying at an upscale Manhattan hotel, Polsky writes that (in case he wanted to stay there in the future) he decided to ask a few questions of the concierge, "a moderately attractive young lady, who was wearing a very businesslike skirt, jacket, silk blouse, and matching bow." (p. 208).  Why exactly does it matter that the concierge was "moderately attractive"?  So we can gauge how excited Polksy was?  So the reader can decide whether he or she would rather stay at a hotel where the concierges are more than "moderately" attractive?  Notably, Polsky then does not even have any questions for the concierge -- so it appears that the whole event was not designed to give him an opportunity to find out if he'd want to stay there in the future (as he claims), but simply so he can decide how "attractive" the concierge is.  The book abounds in such pointless detail.  The author comes across as self-impressed to an extraordinary degree, and while his occasional insights on the art world are interesting, the reader must suffer through a remarkable amount of banal detail.  Not recommended 
 This is one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen.  The characters, especially the two main actors, have no common sense, no brains. This story is about lies, betrayal, selfishness. It justifies all these values in the name of love. Is that true love?  The real victim in this whole film was the poor fiance who had no idea that his girlfriend, Gabriela, was a total whore. How could anyone trust as woman who changes her mind ever 5 min?. I felt absolutely disgusting after the film. It's not romantic, its definitely not a love story, not exiting, intelligent, nothing, It offers nothings. It's cheap and I wasted my money by renting it.  The only good acting in the film was by Lupe Ontiveros. She deserved more scrip time. So, please do not buy this film unless your into ghetto, cheap, lust stories.  
 I practice patent law, and believe there needs to be a serious reconsideration of intellectual property rights and economic incentives for research in this country.  Unfortunately, I cannot take this book seriously, and will return it rather than finish reading it. In reading perhaps 30 pages of the book, I noted quite a number of basic errors or mischaracterizations of patent laws and the basic mechanics of obtaining patents.    Perhaps he has some good arguments to make about IP rights. I might even agree with some of them. However, he has either failed to do his legal research properly or he has deliberately mischaracterized patent laws. Either way, his credibility is shot with me 
 Animal Man Volume 1, reprints Animal Man # 1-9. I was expecting a lot from Animal Man. I am a long-time Vertigo reader and enjoy most of Grant Morrison's work. This being his first entry into American mainstream comics (and the start of the famed "British Invasion"), I was expecting something along the lines of Shade the Changing Man or Doom Patrol. Instead we get pretty standard superhero fare complete with the requisite appearances by Superman, Hawkman, et al. Majority of this book is centered around Animal Man's return to super-heroics, his battles with B'wana Beast and Mirror-Master. There is also a cross-over with DC's "Invasion" storyline from the late 80's, which is a bit distracting. Granted, Animal Man Books 2-3 do get progressively better and start to contain some of the experimentation that you might expect from Morrison. So the story in itself isn't too bad, and I would have been content with just picking out some early signs of genius (such as issue # 5). But what really took away from my enjoyment of this book is Chas Truog's terrible art. You would think that with a title like "Animal Man", they would find an artist that could draw a decent cat or dog. Although people are drawn pretty badly too. Backgrounds are rushed or non-existent and it feels as if no effort was put into the art for this book at all. As bad as the art is, the coloring is even worse! It looks like maybe 12 colors were used total for the entire book. Only recommended for Morrison completists and late-80s-era DC superhero fans that are able to overlook shoddy art. Story 2/5 stars. Art 1/5 stars 
  Kwok is on fire in this movie with maybe his best physical performance ever. He looks like a pop star but his acting is actually very good. Unfortunately, his performance is completely wasted in a movie this bad. I won't explain the story, it is cops vs. drug dealers. There is a beautiful fighting female, good car chases, big name stars, and good fights. How did this movie go wrong? Well, Stanley Tong is a decent director, but he is a stuntman, screen fighter, and martial arts choreographer at heart. He tries to make this an American movie but he disregards everything that gives feeling to movies. I cracked a smile more than a few times but this is the most mindless modern day film I have seen in a long time. Usually, I am able to get past all of this since I am a sucker for good fight scenes, and this movie does have a few. Highlights to watch for are Ken Lo vs. Marc Dacoscos and Dacoscos vs. everyone in the final fight. The thing that ruins this movie is that the real final fight never finishes, but instead it moves on to a totally ridiculous fight to finish off the movie. 'Cradle to the Grave' has a better end fight! Stanley Tong must have been out of his mind because in the finale, Coolio ends up as the main opponent. Not Ken Lo who is the leg fighter that faces Jackie Chan at the end of 'Drunken Master 2', and not Marc Dacoscos who is one of the very best modern day martial arts actors, but Coolio.   I honestly thought this was a good cheesy movie, but the final fight sequence is just horrible. Stanley Tong comes up with a great idea having the actors fighting on a huge piece of glass hundreds of feet in the air and they have to keep their balance while they fight. It is just too bad Coolio had to ruin it. 2.5/5   DVD from Dimension Home Video has good sound and picture quality. No special features except the outtakes in the credits which was a much more satisfying end to the movie. 
 Besides the limited examples of hex signs, spell candles and corn dollies, the book is essentially good for lining birdcages and as an alternative source of heat-fuel.  I am extremely dissappointed in it's almost complete lack of atuhenticity and credibility.  The cover title explicitly states "creating magical objects".  The contents of this book essentially amount to an arts and crafts session at summer camp, and are about as 'magical' as belly lint.  This book was obviously created with pagan children in mind and should be marketed as accordingly.  I really think that an intelligent, earnest pagan adult deserves better 
 This seemed like a great idea but it doesn't work very well for cloth diaper users, like me. I use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs. However, since my cloth diapers won't fit into the diaper organizer, I'm not sure what to put there. Because of this, there is a lot of wasted space.      I would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers 
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 Mary Daly is published for exactly the same reason that Hustler is published - there is a sizeable market of stupids who simply like reading trash 
 I see nothing in these allegedly shocking documents that shocks me.  Why wouldn't anyone who wanted to save the lives of Jews not cooperate with the devil himself - or even Hitler (who was worse because he actually existed!) - to save them?  And why wouldn't Hitler want all the Jews he could get out of the country to go and resettle in a small strip of land in the Mideast, all the better to eventually wipe them out?  Indeed, Hitler was *definitely* collaborating with the Palestnian Arabs with whom he shared the goal of doing just that.  Lip-service to tryants who can wipe you out is a not a surprising thing, especially when there is a war going on with the outcome uncertain.  One says and does what is necessary to survive, which may be "unprincipled" but is also understable 
 I wonder if Pat mentions his diamond mine in Zaire in his book? The African Development Co., based in Zaire, was established by Robertson during the rule of the late dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Mobutu was a sadistic, murderous, dictator who kept his country's people in poverty while he becomming one the richest men in the world. In April, 1997 two pilots who worked for Operation Blessing, Robertson's African relief organization, charged that planes linked to Robertson and his ministry flew mostly to haul equipment for ADC's private diamond operation. Robert Hinkle, the chief pilot told reporter Bill Sizemore that of about 40 flights within Zaire during the half-year period he was there, "Only one or at most two" were related to the humanitarian mission of Operation Blessing. The rest were "mining-related." So much for humanitarian aid given by Robertson's followers to relieve African hunger.   Man of God? More like man of money. Robertson is merely another snake-oil selling scumb@g bilking his "flock" for personal enrichment. Mobutu Sese Seco is not the only brutal dicator Robby is/was pals with. Others include Jorge Serrano, former dictator of Guatemala, and Frederick Chiluba, the ruler of Zambia who brutally enforced christianity as Zambia's state religion despite sizable minorities of other religious beliefs. And let's not forget Robertson's gold mine in Liberia and his friendship with now owsted president Charles Taylor, a warlord blamed for torture, killings, forced labor, and extortion. Taylor is a partial bankroller of al-Qaeda and was indicted by a U.N. war crimes tribunal for arming Sierra Leoneon rebels who specialize in mass rape and in hacking off the limbs of civilians including many children below the age of 12. He's one of Pat's special friends who he supports to this day. I'm not going to go so far as to say Pat is the antichrist, but he sure meets a lot of the criteria 
 This CD Was uttely boring it sounded like Dianne didn't even care that she was singing. It was a disappointment to me becuase she usually is pretty excting. I felt like she didn't do enough to make this CD perfect. I mean if it was just a regualar person putting out their very first CD, it wouldn't sound like this, becuase it wouldn't sell! Okay so, I have to give it 2 stars becuase at times it sounds relazing and nice, but then I think that every Christmas CD should be as excting as Christmas really is 
 I'm afraid that the reviewers who didn't like this movie understood it all too well.  At times it promises real drama and tension, but never delivers.  There are too many character twists with no basis.  And the ending really does make the viewer feel cheated.  This is a really poor attempt at making a movie 
 I ordered two Kitchen Books. Great Kitchens: Design Ideas from Top Chefs AND Great Kitchens: At Home with Top American Chefs. GUESS WHAT? Same book. That is why I gave it a low rating. I feel I was Dooped. Of course, I sent the book right back but why change the cover photo and title?  I could find nowhere that is said they are the same book. I did not need the aggrevation so beware 
 Let's face it. Nothing anyone says can sway a particular fragment of this movie's viewing audience one way or the other. Those who love J.Lo will declare the greathess of this movie, in a variety of ways.  Those who hate J.Lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is. And those who love quality film won't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists. Guilty pleasure, indeed! One thing you have to admit about J.Lo, she's consistent. She sings bad, acts bad, and is merely eye candy, for thoe who find her appealing. And this movie is full of all of the above, plus awful, cliche ridden, emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with Hollywood writing aspirations, since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes. At least it's had it's short, but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels, cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous, just like the lead starlett. Maniupulative only begins to describe this drek. But that said, it's more than enough time wasted on this movie. I merely felt compelled to warn folks. Don't waste your time. It stinks 
 Here I thought I had the perfect book for my upcoming journey from Boca Raton to Sarasota via I-75.  It arrives today and I search the pages for I-75 in Florida.  What a downer! I can't understand why the author did not complete his work for the entire distance of I-75, instead of ending it at the Florida-Georgia border. Perhaps he ran out of gas. No matter - Tomorrow I'm returing this book to Amazon 
 Nothing inside, nothing usefull, 9$ for nothing. All my applause to be such a good salesman, you could sell fridge in north pole ! But for event planing..... All what is essential in this book is to not buy it 
 I'm sorry but this album was a huge let down. I usually like beats from Dre, Storch, Just Blaze, Swiss Beats, ect but here the beats are just dull and the lyrics aren't any better. This is my first Busta album so I can't judge him as an rapper just from one album but this was just garbage. Maybe not the worst of the year but it just didn't work for me.  Thumbs dow 
 I read the book, New Faces, hoping for an intelligent look into the  way people view themselves as being multiracial. "Dr." Loretta Winters appears to be one of the worst, most absent minded speakers on the subject. Her writting is horrible and I believe that she lied about having a Ph.D and about being Biracial. Her own psychological state of mind is clearly unstable and unhealthy and I think she needs to seek some counseling for playing this sick game on humanity. This is one of the worst looks at being multiracial. I found the book to be unclear and came off like a drunkards rambles. I pity the soul that ever come across this and her repetive, condescending overtones. I am multiracial and offended at how she writes that we are all the same. 
 This novel was quite possibly one of the worst I have ever read.  Poorly written, and grammaticly hard to swallow, Davis' arguements are hard to see through all the philosophical "crap" he presents.  Davis paints of a picture of government conspiracy, and proposes a solution of anarchy and social equality (which he then goes on to contradict, because apparently there can be no equality).  Disability is a serious issue,and should be treated as such.  Davis makes a mockery of these people and their struggle, and should be tarred and feathered.  Davis, here is my message to you: Please do not write anymore...you are not a scholar, an expert, or a professional for that matter.  Move on and stop feeding America your radical ideas 
 The lack of imagination in this book is incredible (it is, in fact, the only incredible thing about it). Ms. Bushnell merely takes clichï¿½d ideas of powerful, wealthy men's lives and applies them to four women. The result reads like a collection of phony Playboy short stories -- only with female names.  There is really very little character development. I had no feelings one way or the other for any of the characters.   Also, there is no development of the relationships between the women. There's just no glue there -- it is as if it were written about three unrelated strangers.  Additionally, it's one of those books where you keep waiting for something to happen -- and nothing ever does.  Sorry, but I really found nothing entertaining in this book 
 This video shows absolutely NO detail and barely skims the surface  regarding each technique.  Then it wastes a lot of time with a rambling  interviewing of Jack Grout.  This video definitely falls short of what it  claims to do 
 The price for the twinpack ($67.52) is more than twice the price of two single packs ($24.57 each).  $24.57 x 2 = $49.14  Buy two of the singles, not the twin pack 
 As other reviewers have been, I'm also unhappy with the removal of central plot elements, especially Mrs. Cheveley's broach.  The effect of removing this element is that it is Chiltern who saves Goring, not Goring who saves Chiltern, and the play therefore never gives Goring his moment of heroism and nobility.  This film  is too jolly and innocent.  Laura Cheveley's hubris, Robert Chiltern's anguish, these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on Goring, his wit, and his pre-marital uncertainty.  I do think the film is entertaining, for what it is worth.  Anyone who has an interest in romantic comedy or a very casual interest in Wilde will probably enjoy it.  If you know this play and Oscar Wilde well, though, you may be frustrated 
 If you want a good history from the 60's of screen printing then this is the book for you.  It was first published in 1963 and hasn't been updated since.  Old black and white pictures are included that would be seen in an old Popular Mechanics to include the hand drawn illustrations.  If your looking to review or learn new techniques or just refresh your memory this is not the book to get.  I'm starting my own business and after being out of it for a few years I was wanting a refresher book I could look to.  This was not the one 
 This could have been a riveting tale...the problem is the story has no depth whatsoever. I would even say it is badly written. We dont get any insight as to what Jamie found lacking in his marraige. We read about Jamie's dreams' being shattered ....but what wexactly were those dreams? to be a race car driver? And how did having a family stifle him? these issues are never explored.    And when he decides to go back to his family, what made him do that. A pep talk from his friend? Guilt? I wish the story had delved more into what happens to the husband and wife when they get back together and how they decide to rebuild their shattered lives. The story was very sketchy and it simply didnt delve into different emotions. There was more time spent on commuting details than the actual affair. And after all that, it seemed like Jamie went back to his wife more out a sense of duty than because he loved her.  The final straw is that the lead characters are totally unlikeable. Jamie acts like a total jerk and seemed to be more considerate towards his mistresses' feelings than his wife's.  And Teri seems to relish the affair with no thought to the consequences of what they were doing including throwing her best friend out.  I hope Matthews doesnt write a sequel to this story...the heroine is totally unsympathetic and I doubt if many readers will identify with her 
 I was very dissapointed in the length of this book. Compared to other organic gardening books, this should be listed as a brochure, or maybe as a synopsis of "How to Grow More Vegetables..." A buyer's money could be better spent. Personally, I would not buy it again. Figuring that it would cost me half of the cost of the book to return it to Amazon, I'll probably just give it away as a gift to a new gardener. This is not to say that there is no useful information in the book, but more information can be found in other, -longer- books 
 The individual metal pieces that make up the base do not line up when you screw them together.  The manufacturer failed to make units that screw in straight.  Instead of a solid uniform stand that comes in pre-assembled lamps, the lamp looks horribly cheap because it zig-zags at various angles instead of standing up @ a 90 degree angle because of poor manufacturing.The weight of the housing for the 5 gooseneck lamps is too much for the poorly manufactured stand and will cause your lamp to eventually lean over no matter how many times you re-position it.  I had to buy and return the lamp 3 times to get a lamp that didnt 1) have faulty wiring OR 2) the stand was not crooked OR 3) the stand did not lean over @ a 50 degree angle. Eye-pleasing lamp but the designer/manufacturer has forgotten the principle of function before form. 
 What trash! What a paranoid book! A true work of tendentious and speculative fiction disguised as an essay.   No wonder that Amazon stands ready to sell this book for $0.35! Even then, it's a quarter and a half wasted. No wonder also that warmongers Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle gave it a note of thanks. It reads like their own propaganda in their conspiracy to take over American foreign policy and steer it to Israel's favor.  But the Mylroie-Wolfowitz-Perle cabal DID succeed in having the U.S. attack Iraq. This only shows the tremendous importance of propaganda and the strength of the pro-Israel lobby. Nazi Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda, would be proud of Laurie Mylroie, since he  once said: "If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it." 
 Please note that I'm doing a review for the whole series up to now.  The start of Megatokyo was fairly shaky and almost like a rip off of Penny Arcade but with a mixed in running story. It was funny and it was irrelevant. What truly impressed me with Megatokyo was how both creators Fred (the artist) and Rodney (the co writer) worlds/writing would blend together to form a very distinct parody/comedy/story telling style.   I love how contrast of the 2 main characters Piro (the serious and hopeless lover manga archetype) and Largo (the delusional gamer) are able to mix their worlds together so well. My favorite moments in the manga is when Piro talks seriously about his problems with relationships while in the background Largo levels Tokyo with a giant radioactive lizard.  Unfortunately, with the departure of Rodney, most of the magic is gone and the manga has turned into a story driven angst filled anime soap with only few interesting moments in between. The plot keeps going over and over again and it is mentally draining listening to all the angst spewed repeatedly by the main character Piro.   Another sad thing I have noticed in this series, for a NOW story focused comic, pacing is not only slow but there is virtually no character development. The characters stay static and when there are hints they will be use to make the story interesting, Fred drops the ball by using stale old anime story clichés.   I understand that Megatokyo tries to parody anime and manga, and I have no objection to that but how he uses this parodies as a story telling element is poorly done pretty obvious to where he copies most of his ideas (A.I. loves you, love hina etc).  I'm guessing that many of its fans are relative newbies to manga and anime so most of the elements Megatokyo copies from anime and manga are, to them, fresh, new and/or interesting - so I can't really blame them. Of course there is also that otaku fan boy fantasy of going to Tokyo and doing what the main characters have done. It seems Fred has found the jackpot by targeting the right demographic just like what how producers of boy bands target teenyboppers.  Maybe my standards are just a little too high for a webcomic like megatokyo but considering how great its fans make it out to be, you'd think it would be fantastic as sliced apple pie. If you are a veteran of manga and anime, I cannot recommend this series to you but if you are one of those new wide eye anime fans then Megatokyo might appeal to your sense of wonderment about whole new world of Japanese comics and japanimation 
 Avoid this one. The bad reviews are not kidding. The plot is almost non-existent. The action scenes are not enough to make up for the poor editing. The writing has drawn the characters very thinly. Sadly, a reason to watch this movie is to be amused at how badly it is put together 
 The Long Long Trailer is a good movie but Too Many Girls is when Lucy and Desi were very young and thin but the movie Too Many Girls is awful and Forever Darling is awful 
 It goes without saying that this man is a pioneer of his craft, however there are throngs of contemporary chefs who are doing things with food that show that they know their ingredients better than Peterson does- good cooking is a result of knowing your ingredients and knowing them well. Peterson claims that there is little, if any, difference between Wild, farm-raised, and Atlantic salmon. This is preposterous! The difference is oceanic. Perhaps Peterson has never eaten Wild King Alaskan salmon or Copper River Sockeye salmon or anything from the Yukon River, which is a real pity, because one of our lifetime's greatest foodies is missing out on the greatest culinary experience of all time! Save you money and spend it on Peterson's Fish & Shellfish. Even the salmon recipes are better 
 Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? & second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? & then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. & then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. & for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film 
 This book offers no real practical advice for reader to "survive" in crazy and dysfunctional workplace. Furthermore, the writing of this book is way too PHD-alike to tie to its "light-hearted" title. I stopped reading it after 20 pages or less 
 Much is made of dyson's intellectual prowess; this just goes to show you that all things are relative. There are organisms shuffling down the street to whom dyson's intellect would, one assumes, seem impressive. But that don't necessarily make it so. You may, at some point, have heard the term pinhead. The term signifies that the owner of such a head has a tiny little brain, a "peabrain" if you will. This, in a nutshell, is dyson. He meanders around offering weak commentary and observation that appeals chiefly to the MTV and BET crowd. This is to say, he offers nothing of value other than allowing Penn to make their quota. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs 
 I got this book for my birthday this year after reading all the stellar reviews.  I was disappointed as soon as I began paging through, and my disappointment has only increased with time.  I live in a decently sized metropolitan area, yet I had a hard time finding the required ingredients at any of the three Asian and Indian grocers in town--even ethnicgrocer did not have many of the needed items.  After several trips and a lot of searching, I finally scraped up enough ingredients to make Khatte Channe--it's one of my favorite dishes to get at the Indian restaurants around town, but this one turned out terribly sour and not a bit appetizing, though I followed the instructions to the letter (I will say that the instructions are fairly clear).  After spending well over an hour preparing this dish, it was crushing not to want to eat more than the first bite.  I don't know if I'll ever bother trying another recipe from this book--they are all incredibly long and involved.  There is also very little variety.  I was shocked to see one reviewer call this book "comprehensive."  There are not very many dishes in here at all, and many of the staples that I see at the Indian restaurants around town.  Over all, it's disappointing in virtually every way 
 Once again, Carr's central truth is: To know how the addiction works is to be free of it.   Unfortunately this is simply a false dawn.  The greater the need for a solution, the more willingly we suspend disbelief and trust in a system that promises an end to our problem.  This is not to say the book contains nothing of worth. But Carr's demand for total deference and his insistence on offering a complete cure inevitably prepare us for eventual disappointment. We are all more intelligent than we are capable and awareness of the insanity of addiction never saved anyone from the disease. 
 I've enjoyed Fluke's other baking mysteries but this one wasn't much of a mystery--but may be a good cookbook, I've not tried any of the 174 pages of recipes yet.  Fluke fell into the most hated of all mystery novelists' sins--she didn't give you the clues in advance, just let them "pop up" when it was time for the exposition and announcement of the killer.  I've read 5 of her other mysteries so I was pretty well versed in the characters that are standard in her novels.  However, if you pick this up as a first read, you'll have no idea about the dynamics of the family or the town (or the love triangle which, by the way, is getting pretty old--Hannah just needs to make up her mind and go with it) because they are given no depth at all in this book but are nothing more than one-dimensional cut-outs used to decorate what is obviously a holiday cookbook.  Don't waste your time or money on this one 
 See Fran Fried's comprehensive review for the real lowdown on this collection: he NAILS it. Calling this "Children of Nuggets" is highly misleading, and even the producer hedges his bet in his liner notes. Too much stuff that just doesn't belong here and too much stuff left out that should have been included. Very disappointing.. 
 I've been a They Might Be Giants fan for several years and I am about to become a teacher, so I have been perusing many children's books lately and decided to check out Bed Bed Bed.  I listened to the book with the CD and the thing that stuck out at me the most about this book was the pacing. "Impossible" is the longest song, but all its lyrics are crammed into two spreads. While listening, I found myself becoming bored looking at those pages so long. At that point, the book just seemed like a decorated lyrics page.  "Happy Doesn't Have to Have an Ending", though only 3 spreads (including the title page), was much better paced because of its fast tempo.  "Idlewild"'s three spreads were perfect, since it was a short song with few words.  However, "Bed Bed Bed" was a whopping 11 spreads long, even though its time length was just a bit shorter than "Impossible". I know it's the title song and should probably have more emphasis, but in this case, it meant that I had to flip through one line pages so quickly that I didn't even have time to glimpse at the pictures if I wanted to keep up with the song! I would have much rather had more images of the shape-shifting imaginary creatures in "Impossible" than individual pictures of kids doing things like brushing their teeth and sitting around.  I got this book thinking that it would potentially make a unique addition for a listening center in my classroom, but if I had such a hard time keeping up with the book, I imagine my students would be even more frustrated.  If only a few changes were made, this book would be much better, but for now, if I want a visual representation of They Might Be Giant's kid songs, I'll stick to Here Come the ABC's. 
 This is a book for a web course I took this term. The book has an interesting set up; half of the chapter is a textbook type chapter, with background and information, the other half is a reader with selections from modern feminists. The first half was nicely done. There was the main part of the text, with boxes that featured activities and polls and profiles. The second half is what pissed me off. Now no offense to any pacific islander lesbians or hispanic transgendered people, I have no problem or complaints with you. The book however, got so caught up with issues that effected a small microcosm of society, that it failed to connect with me. You know a white woman college student. In many cases it insulted me, one essay refered to women in the academic world as 'white women helpers' of the 'male heirarchy.' Excuse me as I get my flying monkeys. It  made the classic mistake of open-mindedness; it closed its mind to everything but what its being open-minded about.   I have a friend in college whose goal is to get married and have kids. She is majoring in physical therapy and plans to work in the school system so her schedual will work with the kids scheduals. Great goals, she knows more about where she is going than I am. The people portrayed in this book (and many in the course) would consider her a sell out. Would respect her more if she was living in the back of a Westfalia van writing a zine or lesbian p0rn or something. And I just can't stand that. While a man and some ankle-biters might not be in my future any time soon, I respect that that is what she wants in life. Whats the meaning of a 'woman's movement' if they don't respect women 
 These are ten classic film noirs. Unfortunately the video and audio quality of these DVDs is very poor. Get these films in other releases 
 Get the book, this one covers off on some of what he went thru but falls flat on the time he spent in combat. I remember AMC showing this movie and the host commenting that Audie Murphy went thru a lot trying to get his book on the screen. Basically, they sanitized and cleaned everything up to the point where if you were young enough, you might think war is not that bad even if you get killed. I have had a copy of the book for about 20 years and have read it about 3 times, viewing the movie once ws enough for me. It is amazing how "all is quiet on the western front" made much earlier when standards were even more rigid was able to pack a bigger punch, make a point and be more satisifying than this watered-down mess. Get the book, wait for the movie to come on TV 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 I was recently investigating options for single sourcing when I came across Kurt Ament's book Single Sourcing:  Building Modular Documentation.  Based on the glowing reviews the book received, I decided to order it from Amazon.com.  Unfortunately, the book was not what I expected.  For the price of $[...] on Amazon, the book provides little help to experienced professional writers. My biggest complaint is that too many pages of the book are spent promoting the author's own ideas of style and usage rather than discussing true single sourcing issues. (134 out of 210 pages, to be precise, were dedicated to matters of style.)  Some of the style and usage guidelines are handy for modular documentation, however, I believe each company should decide its own appropriate guide for style and usage rather than relying on the author's word. Had he couched his preferred guidelines as examples, perhaps I would be less inclined to view them negatively.  Granted, understanding how to simplify and standardize language is key to developing text for reuse within a body of work and reuse text for localization.  Writers need to understand how to simplify and standardize text before starting to think about how to leverage tools for single sourcing.  Describing how to use standard language, however, is different than promoting a writing style, and probably requires far fewer pages than Ament dedicated to it.  One of the reviews on Amazon raved about how well this book could be applied in conjunction with Information Mapping. I disagree. The author clearly does not approve of breaking processes or procedures into tables, which is a cornerstone of Information Mapping. In fact the author has very strict guidelines about when you should use a table and when you shouldn't. (Again, he is pontificating a particular style rather than offering solid advice on single sourcing.) Don't take my word for it; examine the table of contents very carefully before you buy this book.  What the book does well, is offer good general advice on where to start thinking about chuncking your documentation in order to reuse it again and again. Also, Ament provides a concise lexicon of single sourcing terms that will help you properly articulate your ideas to your teammates. Most of the flags and highlighting I used in the book were confined to chapters 1, 2, and 5.  This book might serve well in an introductory professional writing course, but if your company is seeking guidance on single sourcing, find a book that is tool specific or find a book that sticks to single sourcing and leaves style and usage decisions up to you 
 I really wanted this album to be brilliant. Instead it's just simply "okay". It's hard to tell what Andy was shooting for - gone are the straight-up simple beat-heavy tracks of his last album - and gone are the harsher sounds of his earlier work. It's like he couldn't decide if he wanted to be more hardcore or more mainstream so instead he ends up being neither. I so badly want this album to kill on the dance floor but I'm afraid the best it's going to do is fade unceremoniously. Meh 
 The book," The International Jew," a collection of articles, portents to present a scientific analysis of a problem, both the problem is stated and defined by the Author. The book is clearly aimed at an audience that neither requires, seeks, nor needs any substantiation of statements or claims made regardless of how devastating their effects may be on the affected.  If these articles had been submitted to a scientific body for publication, they would have been rejected out-of-hand being devoid of any Bibliography or References, making it impossible to verify any of the statements. However, even without this reference material, the contradictions found in this text are so obvious that it is impossible to view it as a serious undertaking.  To be specific, on page 8 it is stated:  "The single description ...of Jews ...is this: he is in business. It may be only gathering rags and selling them, but he is in business...the Jew is supremely gifted for business." And on page 14: "...wherever they [the Jews] wandered, the center of business seemed to go with them."  Yet on pp 33-34 one finds: "Associated with Columbus in the voyage were at least five Jews. Luis de Torres, interpreter; Marco, the surgeon; Bernal, the physician; Alonzo de la Calle. and Gabriel Sanchez. The astronomical instruments and maps which the navigators used were of Jewish origin." Of the surgeon and the physician only the first names are known. How, then was their religion ascertained? In fact, how and from whom was any of this information obtained? Here we have an Interpreter, a Jew; a Surgeon, a Jew; a Physician, a Jew; and the Navigational Instruments and Maps all made by Jews. WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE IN-BUSINESS JEWS?  Is one to believe that in all of Spain the only Surgeon to be found turned out to be a Jew? Is one to believe that in all of Spain the only Physician to be found also turned out to be a Jew? Is one to believe that in all of Spain the only Interpreter to be found turned out to be another Jew? And in all of Spain, makers of Navigational Instruments and Maps, all turned out to be Jews?  Did the Surgeon sail with Columbus because he was planning to peddle surgical instruments to the ship's crew? Did the Physician come aboard to push cough syrup and band-aids at exorbitant prices, having captive consumers at his mercy? And the Interpreter, did he arrive with a truckload of dictionaries counting on making a huge profit from selling these books to the sailors who had money in their pockets and no place to spend it?  Or would it be more reasonable to assume that, for a voyage of this gravity, Columbus picked the very best he could find. Now, if that is the case, then it would appear that the "supremely gifted [Jew] for business" turns out to be equally supremely gifted for Languages, Surgery, General Medicine, and the Manual Skills required to create navigational instruments and maps.  Perhaps one other example may prove to be of interest. In this book there are drawn constant comparisons between Jew and Gentile when no comparison on this basis is possible. Whether one considers a Jew a member of a specific race or a specific religion or both, a Gentile is neither: He is not the member of a specific race or the member of a specific religion and, obviously, he cannot belong to both of them. From the point-of-view of a Jew, a Gentile is anybody who is not a Jew. From a Mormon's point-of-view, anybody who is not a Mormon is a Gentile, which leads to the interesting and perhaps even amusing conclusion that from a Mormon's point of view, A JEW IS A GENTILE!  Last, but by no means least, once it becomes clear that the "The International Jew" is based on "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion," the need for proving discrepancies disappears. For decades now a number of independent Historical Scholars have shown that "The Protocols ..."are fictitious minutes of meetings that never took place.  Since a Theory based on an erroneous Hypothesis is an erroneous Theory, therefore, a book or series of articles, based on a fictitious account, consequently is itself a fictitious account of the 2nd order.  One may ask, how is it possible that so many have taken these statements for GOSPEL. The only answer I have to offer is this: " There are none so blind, as those who do not wish to see!" There are none so deaf, as those who do not wish to hear! 
 I'm what you call a chess Connoisseur (also a class A player) having read many types of chess books in the past that emphasize on endgame, strategies, openings, chess technique, even chess psychology. So when I purchased Rapid Chess Improvement, I expected some orginial advice on how to analyze your own games and diagnose what area you may be deficient in-what I as well as many Grandmasters believe a great way to improve. When I got through this book I wasn't too impressed since it said that tactics are all you need up until expert. I find this claim very superficial since these so called "tactical" shots are likely to fall in to the hands of a player who has the better position of the pieces. If you notice...all the tactical positions in the program that he reccomends (CT-ART 3.0) have positions that could only be produced by good positional play. What does he say about positional play?? Let's as Michael de la Maza himself: "Study tactics and your positional skills will come." Well I would like a lot more guidance than that! Perhaps there should have been an additional effort at how to improve not only your tactical skills, but also how to build a good position that will GIVE you those tactical opportunities. I would presume this takes committed study of openings, and knowledge of the different strategical themes and traps that are common to that opening.  Other than this I appreciate the authors effort at trying to help the chess community out at creating a book that will work for some. But I am a firm believer in the old wisdom that states that intensive study of your own games (and learning from what you did wrong and how you can improve upon that) and master games will give you consistent improvement. And second to that working on bascial tactical motifs and endgame studies. 
 This book is written in what I would call complex, long, wordy sentences that communicate poorly.  It almost seems to be so intellectual that few could understand it.  It certainly is not my style.  I prefer Ernest Hemingway who communicates so simply, so well and in as few words as possible.  This book is the opposite. 
 UGH!  These books are horrible!  Their popularity seems to stem from their quality of reading like stories, which is just what they are- stories!  The historical inaccuracy is embarrassing.  I enrolled my daughter in K12 homeschool program, and quickly withdrew her when I learned that they are using this series to teach American History.  What were the publishers thinking when they promoted this tripe?  I feel very strongly that this series is not worth the paper on which it is written 
 I have to admit that I read through this book fairly quickly and that it kept me more or less engaged right up until the end. Unfortunately, that's about the best thing that can be said for this rather dreary novel. Stewart starts off with the potentially interesting (if over-used) concept of our high-tech world giving away to magic, but then drops the ball. Sure, there's magic out there, but somehow technology still works. Except when it doesn't. And the very high-tech, industrialized city of Vancouver has become nearly medieval while the predominantly rural capital of Edmonton has become a clearing house for high-tech mercenaries. Because, after all, everyone knows how dotcom-oriented cities tend to revert to low-tech primitivism while farm-and-cattle oriented ones tend to spontaneously develop ultra-futuristic technocentric societies.   No, it doesn't make any sense to me either.   Stewart gives us an inexplicable world and then populates it with uninteresting characters about whom we have great difficulty caring. He then loads this down with excessive descriptions of clothing, culture and Chinese philosophy. The whole book feels like Stewart just read a big book about Chinese culture and tried to cram a lot of it into this novel as filler. Speaking of filler, it's bad enough that we have to deal with minor, non-essential characters everywhere but it's downright criminal that we have to put up with the protracted death-scenes of these characters in trite and derivative ways. One character freezes to death while trying to build a fire - which would be interesting to anyone who hasn't read the classic Jack London story "To Build A Fire." As it is, I found myself rolling my eyes repeatedly as the author laboriously copied the same segment directly from London - right down to the 'surprise' ending where a sudden snowfall extinguishes the struggling flames that promise salvation. Very moving. Or at least it would be if it hadn't been done to death a thousand times in literature over the last 100 years.   Very little about this world is explained, so when things come to a climax the reader has no idea WHY things are happening and has to just hang on for the ride. This might be acceptable if the ride ever GOT anywhere, but instead we end up with an uninspired, tacked-on ending that resolves nothing and leaves most of our questions unanswered. We're unable to determine how the preceding adventure has really changed the lives of our protagonists, but that's ok because we don't really care about the protagonists anyway. All we're left with is the vague suggestion that after a mere 80 years of magical resurgance the world is 'changing back.' Hopefully it will change back into something a bit more rational with more interesting people in it. THAT might be a book worth reading 
 "Leaving Reality Behind.." is a myopic and biased account of a subject that just isn't that interesting.  Unless you were one of the eToys.com employees or one of the 'cutting-edge European artists' of etoy, the 'Toywar' was quite simply a non-event for the rest of the planet.  In essence, the authors (who clearly are sided and likely involved with the etoy camp) are trying to dress up a relatively trivial legal dispute over a domain name that is now about three years old.  Why is this interesting??  Throw another 'yet-another-dotcom-story' on the pile 
 The Chinese version of this kettle is lighter and more flimsy - true, it is cheaper, but sometimes you just don't want cheap.  We had a German one that lasted 10 years - and is still being used by by wife in her office.  The one we recently got just is not the same item.  Bo! on Chef's Choice 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 I purchased this item the middle of May.  It is now Oct. 1st and it won't heat up anymore!  Product should last longer than 5 months! 
 You know, the saddest thing aside from how this book needed to be reprinted due to error in logic and fact is that Christina Hoff Sommers ("equity feminist" and not what she frames a "gender feminist" who she rather unhingedly explains more or less is everybody who disagrees with her, something right out of "1984") so blatantly does precisely what she is attempting to expose a bunch of named or un-named and possibly non-existent feminists for doing: selectivism, misrepresentation, omission, appeals to emotion, composition. Though she manages to expose some myths held by some (and some, though Hoff Sommers would like you to believe all feminists - including the straw ones - believe the same thing), lets just scratch the surface on why considering what she was trying to do this book was nothing less than laughably embarrassing. Shall we?  For example with a rather apt critique, Sommers notes Naomi Wolf's incorrect statistics regarding the number of women/girls who die each year from anorexia. Okay, alright that's fine. Except she goes on to do the exact same thing saying the true (reading this book you'd think she deem herself the bastion of truth, it can get excruciating) number is -- wait for it -- 54!! Not only would this have you laughed out of any medical office, but many deaths resulting from anorexia are not known to or are from complications due to it and therefore it is not reported as such. In spirit of trying to show us "the truth", Sommers seems to forget that (or not even bother to try and find out). She selectively quotes psychologist Dr. Ann Petersen to make a point (if you want to call it that) saying the AAUW findings about girls' trouble in school was alarmist junk but, oops, conveniently neglects to include the fact that Dr. Petersen said "(evidence) suggests that increases in depressive disorders and mood are greater for girls than for boys during adolescence."  Something that would be devastating to what she is trying to sell us.  If that isn't enough, the woman flat-out lies about the `Dateline NBC' teacher who had her classroom watched as an example of if boys are called on at the expense of girls. Ms. Summers back-pattingly tries to claim the teacher was outraged by editing and not considering a disproportionate amount of boys in a move that can only be regarded as bizarre. In reality, the woman who was contacted after the "revelation" had no idea what Sommers was talking about. Well, that makes a many of us.  In attempting to debunk the belief that wife-beating was tolerated in mainstream courts and judicial rulings, she cites the fact that there was no rule of thumb ... failing, however, to disprove the fact that, yes, wife-beating was tolerated during the 19th century as "trifling" violence.   For many people, this is a sort of vindication, a Holy Grail if you will, that tells them they are right, feminists (or just people who disagree with the conservative doctrine) are wrong and that they don't have to reevaluate anything that they may not want to sacrifice their own comfort for. Its like it is too good to be true to them. And it is. Far from being an exposure on the feminists/non-conservatives who "censor" accurate information, this is essentially a temper-tantrum aimed at women and feminists - real and the straw ones she creates - who dare disagree with her. 
 This is quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read.  It  drags on like a rusty knife for far to many pages.  The book could have been good, could have saved itself if it had ended on page 152 instead of page 195.  The story after 152 is irrelevant, pointless, lacks continuity, and ultimately leaves the reader wondering why it was included.  Instead of the sad story of the young writer, you end up with that plus a monologue in which the author attempts to build sympathy for himself, justify his existence, and generally prove that at 50 he amounted to something 
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 I don't think you can really write a book to teach someone to be funny.  Fortunately the author does not even attempt that task.  Judy talks a lot on the structure of jokes and setting up punch lines.  I guess I have a hard time buying into this cookie cutter approach of humor.  I have not yet read her latest book so I can't speak to that but I would not recommend buying this book 
 This movie definitely had the potential to be gteat, the action scenes are pretty good.  But the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes.    The final fight did't work for me either, and the very last scene I thought was pretty unnecessary.  Did anyone really remember Joey Wong was in this movie by the time that the end came.    The commentary on the DVD was one of the better ones that I have heard from ric meyers 
 Any book based on the premise that the Rosenbergs were innocent, deserving of beatification, victims of awful America, is not going to date well.  1977, I suppose, was a kind of high-water mark for that sort of thinking.  If you have a friend who thinks Stalin was unfairly maligned, this may be the book for him.  I was forced to read this book cover to cover by a vindictive college professor who assigned it to me (and me alone) as the subject for a class writing project.  I loathed every minute of it.    From its doctrinaire anti-anti-communist, anti-Americanism; its sub-Dos Passos modernism; its sophomoric delight in scatology (giggle, giggle, tee hee, Nixon has sex with Ethel Rosenberg and is then anally raped by Uncle Sam).  There are no fully-formed characters, just endless making of puerile political points.  Nixon-bad.  Time Magazine-bad.  America-bad.  Ethel Rosenberg-saint and martyr.    Its like a bad book treatment of a very bad Ken Russell movie.  I'd rather eat jagged metal bits than be forced to read this pompous, train-wreck of a book ever again 
 This is one of the most far-fetched, outrageous mysteries I've ever read.  Alex Delaware is a thirty-something, retired, child psychologist.  When his cop friend asks him to help on a murder case, the good doctor suddenly becomes a sleuth asking questions with no apparent purpose.  His questioning leads him from one seemingly unrelated death to another.  All of a sudden, our novice detective is racing for his life from a motorcycle assassin, wrestling with a powerful athlete, and brandishing a gun while talking like Bogart.  The conspiracy plot just isn't believable either--a group of pedophiles running a children's home? And they all happened to be college buddies?  Come on.  Don't waste your time on this one. 
 My Background:       I am a junior engineering-physics major, with an interest in microelectronics and circuit design, currently using this book as a textbook for a course on communications systems.  Comments on Previous Reviews:      I am slightly puzzled by those who think that the book is too mathematically intense, there's really nothing much beyond fourier analysis and basic probability, and most of the text relies only on simple trigonometry.  I actually thought the the mathematics in the book were simplistic and inelegant, and detracted from the presentation.  Also, as to the complaint of typos, if you are actually following the derivations, such typos are a minor inconvenience and can be easily identified, and while annoying, by no means invalidate the book as a text.            Finally, to the author of the previous review: you should keep comments about your opinions of other people's intelligence or capacity to be engineers out of your review.  Such remarks are useless to potential buyers, and serve only to demonstrate ignorance and short-citedness.       Critique of the Book:      My main criticism of the book is that it does not give much insight into the topics, and is extremely poorly written.  This makes for a boring read, and I feel like the text did not contribute significantly to my understanding of the subject, but rather I relied on previous mathematical and engineering experience and my professor's explanations.      Furthermore, although it sounds somewhat inane, I was also really bothered by the layout of the book.  For some reason, new publishers decide that it's helpful to stick boxes and charts and change font sizes etc... almost at random, in order to be more dynamic.  This in itself, wouldn't be disasterous, but it seems to contribute to the disjointedness of the presentation.      Anyway, long story short, the concepts are explained poorly, inelegantly, the wording is unecessarily confusing and circuitous, the problems are nothing more than excercises that merely develop facility with manipulating equations rather than providing solid design skills or fundamental insight, and the presentation is fragmented, poorly motivated and arranged.  You can probably learn the material from this book if your background is sufficiently strong, but I would look elsewhere 
 Western Michigan University Professor John Blacking (1928-1990) prefaces his intended answer to the titular question, How Musical is Man?, with the qualification that this work - originally printed in 1973 - is "not a scholarly study, so much as an attempt to reconcile my experiences." With this in mind, the reader should not be surprised to find a self-indulgent speculative which walks a fine line between narrowly focused ethnomusicologic comparative (Western society versus the Venda tribe of South Africa) and a loosely organized philosophical reflection. Ultimately, Blacking presents an indictment of Western culture with relatively rare bibliographic references. The absence of an index or collective bibliography, combined with the restricted assessment, limits the text's use as a convenient or scholarly reference. Nevertheless, it retains value as a time capsule of perspective from a pioneering ethnomusicological researcher. Blacking divides his discussion into four sections: I. Humanly Organized Sound; II. Music and Society and Culture; III. Culture and Society in Music; IV. Soundly Organized Humanity. Throughout, he raises further questions crucial to answering the overriding inquiry. He describes the first three chapters as an attempt to show how research in ethnomusicology may resolve myriad related questions. In the final chapter he endeavors to address why answering the question is essential. Somehow he never quite answers the question satisfactorily.  After an enigmatic opening with what appears to be a feeble attempt at numerologic humor ("Ethnomusicology ... It's seven syllables do not give it any advantage over the pentasyllabic `musicology.'"), Blacking's first chapter positions music as a species-specific sonic phenomenon we are compelled to organize and argues the need to look for patterns and relationships between musical and cultural behaviors. Blacking turns constantly, if monoptically, to his own experiences with the Venda tribe. Blacking goes on to insist the question of man's musicality cannot be answered without first understanding the processes of cause and effect, such as the issue of who performs, sings and listens to music and why. Here he also aptly suggests the social setting may at times even supersede the music in a culture's perception and that it is essential to listen with the appropriate cultural ears. Again he turns largely to the Venda tribe for examples and even provides an illustrated calendar of Venda musical practice and an complicated diagram of musical and social relationships in the Venda society. Ironically, while stepping on and off his societal soapbox, Blacking manages to critique the presumptive arrogance of narrowly focused Western musicologists and condemn the practice of apartheid, but he inherently accepts the Venda tribe's mutilation of women in their annual season of female circumcision. Contradictions abound. The book contains several confusing segues into self-indulgent recollections and intermittent non sequiturs, such as in the ultimate paragraph: "Even falling in love may be more significant as a cognitive activity in which learned categories are realigned, than as an exertion of the sex organs or a hormonal reaction." For a scholarly tome suitable for extended practical shelf life from this author, one might do well to forgo his philosophical prattling for his actual research originally printed in 1967, Venda Children's Songs: A Study in Ethnomusicological Analysis (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1995) © G.

 The recipes have severe errors that make the instructions confusing or utterly impossible. I just had to throw out yet another batch of cookie dough after following a recipe from this book. I have now tried seven different recipes from the book, and am ready to gift to someone I particularly dislike. Seriously, save your money, do not buy this book. 
 I have been using this book for six months in two different courses, and have nearly completed it.  While the content is fine, the number of errata in this book should not be tolerated.   On the book's web page, numerous errata are listed, but there are many more that have not been reported or compiled.  While trying to study this book, the errata keep getting in the way of understanding the material, as there are wrong equations, bad tables, etc.   This book is in its tenth printing, and it is simply inexcusable that this many errata are allowed to remain in the book after so many printings.  Another reviewer (an educator who has the edition with answers in the back) mentioned the number of incorrect answers in the educators edition as well.   So, if you have a choice, look elsewhere for an elementary surveying text. The authors and/or publishers of this one obviously do not care enough to correct the numerous errors which confuse the student 
 I beg to differ with the reviewer that described this work of fiction as being written on a third grade level - that is just plain mean-spirited.  It was actually written on a fifth-grade level!  I actually laughed aloud at the implausiblity of some of the situations - the one-dimensional characters, the coincidences and the fact that none of the other law enforcement agencies investigated any of the "accidents" incurred by the Winthrops is just ludicrous! And Dana's globetrotting at what must have been enormous expense when most of the questions could have been answered through a phone call.  Earlier Sheldon works were so entertaining - he should probably hang it up if this is all he can manage at this stage in his life 
 I was looking for a good treatment of not just what decisions need to be made (I knew those already) but realworld examples I could build on.  Pages and pages of command line switches and API does NOT get OpenLDAP deployed 
 I enjoy watching teen movies because I'm ever so curious about how the director sees this particular age group and the misconceptions present in his view as much as in the teens' view of things.   This movie is unlike most teen "romantic comedies" I've seen, and not necessarily in a good way. First of all, the main characters are unlikeable and don't represent actual categories of people in real life:   We have the good looking rebel who's actually not so rebellious after all but then gets back to his old ways (stupid twist if you ask me), the nerd who can't get any (they picked the worst possible guy to play the nerd; he's actually pretty good looking and a funny guy...), the nerdy girl who hasn't grown up yet (ends up hooking up with the rebel but they break up), the gay guy (I have no idea what his role in this movie was), the aggressive victim of child abuse (...), the freaky nympho with a tint of lesbian (what the hell were you thinking Daniel Waters?) and finally the rebel's childhood best friend who falls in love with him and is rejected (the film focuses about 5 minutes of its total 88 on this character... I don't know why she's even here, she has no obvious role and her situation doesn't reflect at all in the real world).   Next up, I think the director is sexually obsessed or something. Ok, I know sex is an important part of a teenager's life but this movie is about lame 13 year old girls aching for sex and even lamer 19 year olds who have nothing else better to do. If I wanted to see hormonal imbalance, I would go watch Discovery Channel. There are more important things in life than sex, and this "masterpiece" definitely doesn't illustrate them. The characters' thoughts and actions are limited to the camp itself and the director focuses too much on useless stuff and tries to create stereotypes, but fails miserably. Most teen movies have a moral side to them, they teach the audience certain values, unlike "Happy Campers". This movie only taught me that it's so cool to be obsessed about sex, it's cool for 12 year old girls to think they're oh-so-hot women, that only the absolute best looking guys hook up (not true in the real world) and more [...]. Also the director makes completely ridiculous situations seem normal, such as the camp leader getting hit by lightning and then acting completely weird, the counsellors buying 47203 boxes of condoms (there's only so much sex you can have in 40 days...), the whole "Don't-touch-me Todd" thing, and so on and so forth.  This movie isn't worth the $2 I paid to rent it. Those who think this is better than the American Pie series should go out more. American Pie was a work of art, this is a piece of [...] 
 This is one of the worst books I have ever bought.  I had to buy it for a college course and I am furious that my teacher used this one.  It is totally unprofessional and too general. Not only myself but others have complained about the  boringness and also but find it completely useless. It reads like a high school essay project with unnecessary sarcasims, endless repetition and examples that are really very weak and inept in the explanations.  If you are seriously considering pursuing an interest in compensation and benefits, do not use this book. Teachers: don't put any other students through the aggrivation and insult.  We are professionals looking to advance our careers not waste what little time we already don't have.  It infuriates me that I had to pay so much for a book that isn't worth $13.00 never mind $103.00

 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I bought this book because my family lives near the beach. I thought our 17 mth son could relate to the theme.  We were disappointed with this book:  watercolors too light and hard to see and too few pages even for young child. The book did not keep son's interest and he loves to flip thru books and have you read to him. My recommendation: Find another book. 
 After attending a recent lecture by Dr Hira, I found his book and his ideas on US economic evolution incomplete and wavering. Unfortunately, its not information are not grounded or empirical based on US employment trends and globalization.   I recommend you keep looking for better volumes 
 Like many other reviewers, I struggled with this book. For more than 600 pages, Anna Wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life. This might be an interesting book for fiction writers, who might understand the elaborate process Anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art. But for the average reader, this is just too much and too long.  I am very patient with novels. Perhaps too patient, because I should have put this one down sooner. I got all the way to page 500 before I realized I just couldn't go on. And it's quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down. Doris Lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with. I should have taken her advice sooner. But while some books you might not just be 'ready' for, I don't think I will ever be ready for this one.   It's disappointing because I am a Doris Lessing fan. The Four-Gated City explores many of the same themes - an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you. Anna Wulf did have a fragmented mind, as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks. She was kept together by the routines of her life, such as making breakfast for her daughter. When she didn't have anything constructive to do, she thought herself to death. And if you read this book, you'll likely be right there with her - going crazy. 
 Every so often, Thomas Bezucha`s "The Family Stone"  injects itself with a dose of reality about the modern liberal family - that intellectual, caustic, "progressive," argumentative, often matriarchal nuclear unit with imperfections not unlike the conservative "family values" crew. Selfishness. Materialism. Pettiness. Depression. Noise. Veiled cruelty toward the black sheep of the group, which, in this case, is the one most interested in pleasing his parents.   But this movie is not really sincere about the realities of such a family - it's serious about it, all right, but not sincere. It is a Christmas family mosaic where everybody gathers round the twelve-seat dining table of a nine-bedroom house for a seven-course meal to assume their roles and pick on The Prodigal Son's new girlfriend. It is also a button-pushing, shameless picture that insists we like that shrill, pushy Diane Keaton persona more or less because her character is dying of cancer. Keaton plays one of those "full of it" moms - falsely hip, falsely sage,  constantly yelling and hugging and pitching fits and hogging the stage - so accustomed  is she to this domestic tyranny that when the girlfriend calls her on it, we get a scene I couldn`t quite believe.   Back to that in a minute. "The Family Stone" assembles a large cast for its tale: Keaton is Sybil; Craig T. Nelson is husband Kelly; Dermot Mulroney is the parent-pleaser Everett, Luke Wilson is the laid-back  Ben; Ty Giordano is the gay, deaf Thad. And Rachel McAdams slums (just a little) as mommy's academic daughter Amy, who sincerely (yet inexplicably) dislikes Everett's  straight-laced fiancée Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) as much she will eventually like Meredith's sister Julie (Claire Danes), who arrives midway through and enraptures Everett, who`s 16 years older.   "She does this thing with her throat," Amy says of Meredith's phlegm-clearing tic. Meredith cannot  relax, and the Stones' idea of hospitality is to let their guest know how hospitable they could be - if only she would make herself at home. Sybil and Amy take their snarky turns on Meredith. Sybil stares wistfully out the window awaiting the mid-movie revelation that she's dying. Mulroney puts on his Mulroney Face - think Stallone in mild anguish - while Everett wrestles with it all. Kelly and Ben eat marijuana brownies at the high school football field. Ben looks at Meredith as if he'd like to see if she loosens up drunk. Three potato chips if you've guessed she loosens up drunk.  It leads to and falls away from that moment at the dinner table when Ty's homosexuality is thrown around for some tired, liberal humor. Ty and his boyfriend (Brian White) intend to adopt children, and Meredith asks a sincere question of nature vs. nurture, which Sybil bombastically turns into a mini-skit on how she wished all her sons had been gay, a plenty-ignorant thing to say, deliberately said for effect, which Meredith misses. Thus Meredith's second question: "Do you really mean that?"  What Bezucha writes next is fascinating, if brutal and unfair. The entire family dives into Meredith - it climaxes with Sybil literally cursing the girl to hell - while Ty, a saint by now, mists at the notion that maybe he, a deaf, gay man, has had a life he may not have wished on his brothers. Meredith is a stiff and suit, sure, but that "The Family Stone"  actually brings her back into the fold after such a humiliation speaks of its intention to preach and convert.   Of what? Hard to say. That gays should adopt children? That blowhards are better than the sincere because they`re dying and judgmental in the right ways? That all can be forgiven with, fittingly, an old photograph of the mother in her ninth month of pregnancy? That we should worship at the altar of human imperfection? That the movie is really a veiled tribute to the mother Bezucha either had or wished for? If so, well, I did not have. And I do not wish 
 i've had hk products since the 80's and generally like their products. but this is the second hk cd that broke just after a few months of light use (the first one after a couple of years). cd should last longer than that, i believe. i want to stick with hk to have the same brand name in the house, but unsure if i should throw good money after bad any more. 
 My husband and I did not bother finishing this book. We skipped around to different chapters, as the editors suggest, in hopes of finding something erotic. The editors clearly had lofty aspirations for this book, but their  intentions fell short of what they managed to achieve. Unfortunately, most  of the stories were poorly written and laughably ridiculous; a bad  combination. You can get mediocre erotica on the 'net for free. Don't waste  your money 
 The GOOD about "THE TWO FACES..." is that it is superbly researched, well organized, and eloquently presented. FACES gives us a brief historical overview of the progression of Islam since its founding by the prolific self-annointed messenger of God - Muhammad - through the imprinting of Wahabbism by the early band of nomadic criminals we now refer to as Saudi Royalty. It is compelling reading for, and a "MUST read" by, every American in a position of political influence who's otherwise sheltered perspective needs a refreshing slap in the face. The verifiable facts on current Saudi and Islamic undercurrents makes Stephen Schwartz FACES an essential backdrop to our understanding of the route causes of 911, and renders nonsensical the oft repeated question: "Why do they hate us?"    The BAD has nothing to do with the facts as presented by Mr Schwartz. It has everything to do with his confounded objective of telling us that Islam is a wonderful religion that fell victim to Saudi shenanigans on the one hand, while on the other painting Islam's history of perverse anal-retentive dark-ages mentality. Mr Schwartz would have been much better off sticking to the abundant evidence disclosing Saudi complicity, both direct and tangential, in the spread of fundamentalist Islam to further their Imperial appetites rather than trying to defend Islam as a gentle loving religious movement in which we infidels all might want to partake.     The UGLY is Mr Schwartz' high browed dismissal of anyone who dares to question whether Islam rises to the level of a bonafide religion. "Self styled experts", he writes, "claim to have found the proof of deep flaws in Islam itself... These essayists and columnists sketched the image of an Islam that is intrinsically aggressive, contemptuous of modernity and the West, fearful of women, and hateful of reason and individuality." My God! What heady lamb's blood have you been imbibing Stephen? The very nature of Islam's pagan practices in Iran, in Iraq, in Pakistan, in Saudi Arabia, in Gaza, and in every corner of the world where fundamentalist Islam is the backbone of local society, screams of contempt for modernity and for the West.    The last straw of UGLY is Mr Schwartz omission of any reference from the Qur'an. The UGLY truth is that Fundamentalist Islam, as the name implies, is most directly correlated to the writings of the manic depressive Muhammad. Fundamentalist Islam became an instrument of the Saudi family to ensure control over their subjects. It is not, as Mr Schwartz tries to prove, a creation of the Saudi's. Anyone who takes the time to read the monosyllabic treatise of Muhammad will recognize where the Islamic world garners its hate for Jews, for non-Muslims, and most recently for non-fundamentalist Muslims.    Stephen Schwartz is an intelligent, articulate author. He could have done so much better by focusing on the facts, and not appending his personal agenda of favoring his few rational Muslim friends.    
 I admit, I really like fun, entertaining "chick lit" (especially for beach reads or long plane rides) so I was excited to read this book.  However, I found the writing to be poor and I totally couldn't relate to the main character.  I thought the author made her this totally unrealistic woman (who thinks like a sex-crazed man), and I found it very hard to really get into the book or feel any sort or connection to the character (unlike a Bridget Jones, where she totally thinks like a real woman!)  I also thought the the story was extremely unrealistic (I mean, seriously, hiring an investigator to interview all of your old boyfriends and ALL of them happen to say the same thing? It was ridiculous).  Anyway, I found it hard to get through and I wouldn't recommend it 
 I had not read Ted Dekker until I read his collaboration with Frank Peretti with the recent "House".  I really liked that book so I was looking forward to reading more by Dekker.  Unfortunately this was the one I read next and I was very disappointed.  It was hokey.  I'm hoping that some of his others are better 
 I have read a number of Mercedes Lackey books, and have found that she is getting stale.  This book of short stories were just that, short. I picked up the book because it was her. I won't do that again. The only story that  was halfway decent was "The Werehunter". However, it didn't  really feel like the story was finished. The Mage Winds series is  very  good, and so is the Bard series. Try those instead. These stories were  written more at a junior high level. Don't bother 
 Bought this micro in Jan., 2006 and by Oct. 2006 was having big time problems. This microwave oven is a fire hazard! The one I bought started arcing, like an arc welder, between the door and the body of the microwave. Sanyo's, "NO Custumer Service", was anything but helpful! Don't buy any Sanyo products since they are junk and they will not stand behind their product 
 Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry 
 Big disappointment.  I expected this book to be hysterical.  Her sense of humor is certainly different!  Very shallow material. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste. Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money 
 This book is a real let down. I thought that each of the first two books contained some of the best genre prose to come along since Jim Thompson and Raymond Chandler roamed the streets. "The sign of the Book" On the other hand (if looked at objectively) is a pretty pathetic offering to what still could be a very interesting and drawn out series. I think that my main beef with this latest Dunning book is that it just doesn't stack up plot wise to the masterful turnings of "Booked to Die". Instead we as readers are confronted with an alarmingly cut and dry thriller that felt as old as the crumbling Kentucky Blue Ridge Mountains. Secondly, as others have pointed out, Janeway is starting to get a little stale as a literary figure. He has stopped growing here. Instead of as in earlier books, where the reader was able to watch Janeway come to life through Dunnings gifts as an author, here in "Sign of the Book" we see Janeway suffocating on formula.  If you enjoyed the other Dunning books and are looking for something along similar lines to this series, I would suggest the overlooked author Douglas Kennedy. He has one really good one from a decade or so ago called the 'Big Picture'. The plot here really reminds me of Dunning at his best. 
 I seem to remember a goofy date like this on the most recent Yes concert DVD, "Songs from Tsongas"...and that one took about a year and a half to actually show up...  on the other hand, Young IS finally starting to release bits of that trumpeted archive set of his, so maybe this is a legit release (coming at some point, anyway).. 
 They totally misrepresent this product. It does not work with Macs. I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex, shame on you 
 As an experienced programmer, I wanted a book that wouldn't waste my time teaching me C/C++ or explaining event loops in lots of detail. I also wanted comparison between Garnet and Cobalt versions of the Palm OS.  This book does provide some of that information.  It does not provide valid examples. The first code examples are in chapter 3. They claim to build on the Draw application from chapter 2, and assume the reader has details about the event loop from chapter 2. Chapter 2, however, contains neither code nor a description of the event loop used in Palm software. There is no reference to the Draw application in the index, either.  After studying sample code from Palm's web site and trying lots of things in the development environment, I was able to get something that worked.  Other examples mix Garnet and Cobalt veriable types so they wouldn't compile on either system or contain other errors that prevent them from compiling.  A less-experienced programmer would probably give up on page 25 where the text tells the reader to modify a resource file that does not exist. Such a programmer would probably rate the book with one star.  I have not completed the book yet although I intend to do so. I felt compelled to warn other readers about its inaccuracies.  A CD or web site (with working examples!) would be useful to copy and paste tutorial information instead of requiring lots of typing 
 Most of the things  in this book are on the tutorial that comes on your computer, for basic maintenance.  As far as the registry cleaning program, that it suggested to run, I seen no improvement in the speed. It also cost $30 to find that out.  The book should also only be about 10 pages long and cost about $3, if you delete all the content that has nothing to do with a computer 
 This is the worse cannibal film I have ever seen, the film was just terrible with some laughable and very bad acting and the film was not disturbing as some reviewers said it was just bottom of the barrel entertainment and they recycle the same scenes from other older and better cannibal films, you'll probably know the scenes once they come on cause its obvious from the way that they were cut the cannibals look different in each scene. A woman named Shiela is looking for her sister who has dissapeared in the jungles of New Guinea and there are suspicions that she might have joined a cult or weird sect that is away from civilization, the woman hires herself a guide and heads of into the jungle only to find some cannibals and a demented cult led by Jonas who has controlled these people into thinking that they're in a better place. There is alot of sex, blood and gore in this film but it seems to be lacking a plot and a brain, if you liked Cannibal ferox and Cannibal holocaust or any other Italian gore films then you might be interested in this but be warned cause the film is absolutely horrendous and was nothing compared to the other two that I have mentioned 
 I heard lots of hype for this when it came out which caused me to purchase this one instead of the original. Theres a short homosexual scene when The Sgt is in the German hospital and he is kissed on the lips by the medic or doctor. Did that go on that much that theres a need to portray it. I'm surprised in 1980 this was filmed or even thought of since gay was not in back then. Also the scene of him spanking the Hitler youth who shot the G.I. was stupid. The scenes added I could have done without, not too much substance in them. The editors were right the first time when they did this without Fullers permission. I liked it before when there was a sense of honor and pride that I got from the movie, without the sex and useless characters added 
 I havent gotten really, really good and angry at a movie in a long time, and of course, it took a film like Troy to remind me what it was like.  Let me start by saying that if your idea of a good time is Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom slightly misted in sweat and looking pretty, then turn the sound down, grab a bowl of popcorn and by all means, enjoy this movie and the beautiful costuming, and ignore the rest of this review.  BUT, if you expect even one iota more out of a movie.....dont waste your time....I'm saddened by the fact that I cant get the 2 hours and 40 some odd minutes of my life I wasted here back.   The dialogue is insipid (they actually left the line, "I'm sorry sir.... your wife has left with the Trojans." IN the film....), everyone speaks with a British accent, except Brad Pitt....which wouldn't be that bad if he wasnt the STAR OF THE FILM.  And then there are the extras who play sailors....who for reasons I cant quite understand seem to be speaking Greek....when the rest of the GREEKS are speaking English with a British accent....well...except Brad Pitt.   In one scene, Achilles (Pitt) and his cousin (?) sparr with swords among majestic Greek ruins next to a beautiful blue sea....and I actually hit pause to scream at the screen, "Idiots!!! It would have been a BUILDING then! Not RUINS!".  The real Trojan War lasted over ten years....this filmed version appears to last two weeks...with a days break here and there to allow the main characters to look suitably attractive on the beach...and you have very little if any idea of the loss of life on each side.... in short, this movie is pure unadulterated drivel. Youre asked to care about what began the war (you don't), you're asked to believe Brad Pitt's Achilles is smoldering and brooding (you can't), and youre expected to come away with the knowledge that for thousands of years this was considered the greatest war of all time (you won't).  However much was spent in making this film was wasted. 
 March 17, 2006 Amazon Review  Say it ain't so Joe (Disappointing)  "Chances are you have seen and read a lot of other books, books that promise to give you the 'secrets,' the magic, the inspiration.  You probably know a lot about how to hype yourself by looking in the mirror every morning and repeating certain phrases to yourself... and some other magical-power expressions and attitude builders...But let's face it.  What you want to know is how to sell real products and services now.  And most of those authors never sold much in their lives except their books."  The above quote is from the first page of Joe Girard's book "How to Sell Anything to Anybody".  The impression you get is that Joe is a straight shooter and he's going to tell you about real strategies that will really help you sell, not some touchy-feely self-help garbage, and he comes through.  However, the same cannot be said of "How to Sell Yourself".  Now remember the quip about looking in the mirror, he doesn't explicitly ridicule the practice, but it's implied, and it's almost like a joke between you and Joe where he's saying "Yes that's all fine and good for them, but we know better".  So, imagine my surprise when he advocates in his "How to Sell Yourself Book" that you "Put up a little card where you can see it every day, a card that says I am Number One.  Look in the mirror every morning and tell yourself I am my own best salesperson" (pg. 26).  Say it ain't so Joe.  Tell me you didn't just say that.  Tell me you didn't just suggest such a pathetic and ridiculous thing.  Needless to say, I stopped reading the book right there.  If that's the sort of advice you are looking for then maybe this is the book for you, but I was looking for something that wasn't psycho-babble self-help garbage.  Why did I buy the book then?  Because I read Joe's "How to Sell Anything to Anybody" and was sold on his straight shooting, practical advice.  I thought his next book might have some more interesting or valuable things to say; however, I was disappointed.  It comes across as ungenuine.  The impression is that someone offered Joe a truckload of cash to write another book, and even though he didn't have much else to say after his first book, he agreed and this book is the result.  So, I'd definitely recommend Joe's "How to Sell Anything Book" but I can't recommend this book. 
 Ok....we bought this book for the physics club so we could build some cool gadgets and what not. I completely agree with the other peoples review that the author just plugs his website through out the book. WHAT A RACKET!!! He GROSSLY underestimates the cost of building each product. For one of them called the "Two inch spark tesla" thingy...he says that it is a fun expirement that will cost approx. $25 dollars.....So he then goes on to list some parts needed for the project. Most of them are pretty easy to find. But three of them are not...they include a 400V square wave transformer, TWO 25Kv Pulse transformer, and a 300V SIDAC switch....now all these parts are very very very hard to find...(Dont count on radioshack or even your average electronics store carrying these things)...so i went on amazing1.com and i will copy and paste the following prices from his price list...  Chapter 15 - 2 Inch spark Tesla Coil with Timer  SIDAC - 300 volt Sidac ....................$9.95 28K074 - TYPE1PC Switching Transformer ....$17.95 CD25B - 20 kv Pulse Transformer ...........$16.95 (you need 2) PCLITE - Printed Circuit Board ............$9.95  which is more than 70 BUX!!!!....WHAT A LIAR!!!  in addition to the fact that a SIDAC switch is completely unnecessary. there are many cheaper ways to accomplisih this with out using a sidac....SIDACS ARE VERY RARE (as well as the transformers)...WHICH FORCES YOU TO GO TO HIS WEBSITE!!!!  in short the author chooses to build his circuits using rare pieces to force you to go to his website!!!  WHAT A CROOK!!!...  WHAT TRASH! 
 All of the above reviews are correct.  They are nice looking and moderately functional.  I may pour some concrete to overcome some of the functional problems it has.  The stake needs to go deeper into the ground to keep it from coming out.  At $10.99 however, it was a great bargain, and a 4 star rating.  At it's current winter sale price of $16.99 however, it is a 1 star rating.  I'll average them weighting it's current price and give it 2 stars.  
 I loved the writing style in this book--very bright and lively--but the book, to me, was too long because of the bitter, depressing sex scenes. Franzen's people really don't like themselves or other humans, and that ends up being unpleasant. In spite of the wacky humor, the book is really very dark. 
 i don't know to whom this book the author wrote. If you are a beginner, you must be confuse read it but if you are not a beginner again u won't get nothing from this book.There is no tip or trick. Trade for a living far better than this boo 
 Very hard to use, maybe with a lot of practice it would get easier.  Don't buy if you are planning to use immediately.  This is where is I got very discouraged.  Just haven't had the time to play with it so it's sitting in the box 
 I do not like this cd.,  but Jon's Three Ships I have on album for many years and need this out on CD now.  It is one of the best Christmas releases ever.  
 I ordered this book expecting a history lesson but I had 2 major complaints:  1.  Like most people have said before me, most issues are only given vague descriptions leaving the reader in the dark about many important parts of history.  2.  He calls the Bible a book of myths, yet uses it to tell history as if it is fact.  He then goes on to state that Jesus never called Himself the son of God, and as we only have the Bible to reference this (as Mr. Davis himself was not present at the time of Christ) Christ does, in fact, specificly state on many occasions that He is the son of God.  This alone casts serious doubt over Mr. Davis' merit as an unbiased protrayer of history.  He also interjects his opinions that he believes that Jesus did not think of himself as the son of God and presents it as fact without any reference as to where he draws this conclusion from and conviently forgets to rely on the Bible for Jesus's life as he relied on it so heavily for the lives of BC peoples and instead uses his own personal beliefs to explain who Jesus was. That is not history, that is a one-ended religious debate. That is not what I paid for.   If he is so inconsistant in the use of the Bible, I find it hard to trust anything he has to say about any other instances in history, let alone the beginnings of any of the other world religions.   Being someone who supposedly teaches for a living, Mr. Davis needs to realize that teaching is about telling what happened in detail (not sketchy tidbits of information that run together to the point of making absolutey no sense).  A better format, so that the reader is not going from the Persians of BC to 1200AD in a few sentences would help to aid understanding and allow for more detail of who these people were.  We know of wars and conquerors, but were these people?  And most importantly, in teaching, you tell the facts.  If you want to give your opinions on religion and politics, become a columnist or teach a debate class.  When I want a book on history I want facts, not some random stranger's opinion on my religion, or any other religion, for that matter.  I'd rather read my college history text books any day 
 I waited for a very long time for Type O to come out with a new release and like many others, I was sadly disappointed with Dead Again. It is uninspired and BORING. There isn't much else to say except I wish it was more 'goth' because no other band I know could ever do the vampire goth music like Type O. This is just boring music. 
 It was hard to use and understand 
 This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection.  I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets!  There, you can continue shopping 
 This is certainly the worst of it. At least Lil Jon has good beats and stuff. This has none of that, and it is just annoying. Support better artists 
 After reading A Fine Balance I couldn't wait to read another book by this author. I then read his third book called Family Matters which was good but I was disappointed as it by no means compared to A Fine Balance. I just finished Such A Long Journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots.  It is my least favorite of the three books by this author. It's hard to believe that someone can right a book like A Fine Balance, which was magnificant and one of the best books I have ever read, and then turn our stuff that is, at best, average.    
 Two stars may not be a fair rating of this book. I myself couldn't get beyond the first few pages. The author's first concern seemed to be to flaunt his showy "poetic" prose style in sentence after sentence like this one: "I waited for the purple bus to travel through these places edging the round cratered lake where something large from the sky struck long ago, places where the blacktop road sinks through soft-bottomed bogs and erupts flat and dry farther on, a serpentine plumbing of the earth's thin surface, the purple bus leaning on the quicksand curves, slipped tires spinning, the exhaust pipes gurgling, the white-eyed driver mostly blind and dreaming them along the road he drove, steering the bus to where I always slept in wait." Phew. Purple indeed. If this is the kind of writing that turns you on, you'll find plenty of it here 
 Eugene Kennedy has written a heartfelt, impassioned polemic against the Catholic Church's teachings on sexuality. For those who are already troubled by the Church's teachings, Kennedy's rhetorical flourish will seem insightful. For those who wish to think more deeply about the strengths and weaknesses of the Church's teachings, Kennedy offers little of substance. The Church needs to find a way to have an open and healing dialogue between those who accept the Church's teachings and those who do not. Unfortunately, Kennedy's book can only widen the gap between them... which is particularly unfortunate since the book's title suggests that the author recognizes how much we are in need of healing 
 Donald Spoto has got to be THE most boring author I've come across.  He goes on and on and on (get to the point already)!  I'm only half way through this book, and honestly, I don't know if I can finish it.  I love reading about the Kennedy's, and about Jackie.  But this book makes them all seem so, dare I say it again, BORING! Spoto appears to be a huge JBKO fan.  He writes very flattering things about her...almost too flattering.  I don't think he is a very objective author (on this subject anyway). I really don't recommend this book at all.  Save your money for something worthwhile.  If you must read it, check it out from the library 
 I agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not the characters. He goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for "the swede", without letting us know who the Swede really is. Roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration. It gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book. I loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times 
 This quite possibly is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Our company tried to read/study this together and we only made it 1/2 way through because of the poorly written and completely unapplicable content.  I generally don't write bad reviews of products, but this is one I had to tell people about 
 I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem.  Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.  Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality.  His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close.  Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?  The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read.  By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 This book looked promising when I picked it up, but after struggling through the instructions I now regret buying it.  I bought the book to learn right angle weave...but ended up looking up a free tutorial online instead because I could not figure out Christine Prussings instructions and examples.  The right angle weave stitch itself is actually not that complicated...but Christine makes it seem extremely complicated.  Unless you are really good with a compass I do not recommend this book.  I started a beautiful project that she had on the front cover, but once you get done with the base of the piece...her instructions become unclear and confusing.  Now, I have a beautiful unfinished necklace 
 I do not like software. It always hang no matter what I did. Maybe this is becasue it has not finished the index process? I had many many photos  in my computer.  
 ...going to make money on nanotechnology within the next fifty years are stockbrokers and people like Jack Uldrich who -- for a fee of course -- will unveil their nanotechnology "expertise" and proffer advice accordingly...unfortunately, at this point, nanotechnology is little more than a fancy term -- practically speaking there is no tangible nanotechnology outside of research labs and what does exist is years away from commercial development...more pertinent in this particular case, Mr. Uldrich really provides no evidence to support his claim for "expertise" in the field of nanotechnolgy -- his resume shows only that he was a former naval intelligence officer and Defense Department official and also served as the Director of the Minnesota Office of Strategic and Long Range Planning under Governor Jesse Ventura...Jesse Ventura?...hmmmm, I'm not quite clear on how one acquires nanotechnology experience working for Jesse Ventura...moreover, his advice is basically free via columns he publishes every week on the "Motley Fool" website...no, I have to say this book is not recommended 
 As others have mentioned, this starts out innocently with the usual dietary tidbits... then hits you between the eyes with the recommended 15 colonics in the first month; and oh, don't forget to travel abroad somewhere to get the hormone that is illegal to buy in the U.S. and have that injected.  Absolute rubbish, and the first book I have ever returned to Amazon 
 A friend recommended Sue Grafton. So, I read her latest, and after the first chapter I nearly put it down. The ridiculous love life of an 87 year old stud almost did it, but then the crap about his family...well, I wanted a mystery, and all I got was soap. Fortunately, I checked the book out at the library, otherwise I would have asked for a refund 
 I hated this book.  I thought it would be funny, and I wanted to read something that wasn't the typical.... but the author's take on everything is so negative that I couldn't stand to read it.  She indicates you're doomed to get fat, your doomed to be uncomfortable, you're doomed to have an idiot spouse/partner, etc.  People like this author give pregnancy a bad name.  Yes, it has its moments of being uncomfortable, icky, etc., and if you choose to focus on all that, like this author does, you'll also be miserable.  I chose not to be 
 This book is one of the worst books I have ever read, the author has no idea what's going on in LOST the portrayal of the characters is so off the mark that's it laughable I was so disappointed in this book that I actually threw it out in the rubbish bin. If you like LOST and need something to do in-between seasons or episodes bang you head against the wall it would be a far better use of your tim 
 This set of CDs is a fraud!  Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a "translation" by some hack poet.  So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you.  But it is definitely not Chaucer 
 MTV Unplugged 1 was a great album, that blended very well. Unplugged two just misses as a combination of songs 
 In my never-ending quest for the next comic novel, and spurred on by the plethora of enthusiastic reviews here, I knew I wanted to read "Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom." I imagined that the book was along the lines of something written by Christopher Moore ("The Island of the Sequined Love Nun") or Bill Fitzhugh ("Pest Control"). Alas, I was wrong ...  Twenty-one-year-old Duncan Delaney lives with his mother, Fiona, on the family ranch in Wyoming. Duncan isn't pressed by want, and so he's able to indulge his hobby--painting on black velvet canvas. One day, Duncan's best friend, Arapaho, Benjamin Lonetree sells one of Duncan's paintings for the grand sum of $600. The buyer, an attractive dealer in Los Angeles leaves her business card and expresses great interest in Duncan's talent. So Duncan takes the hint, leaves his high school sweetheart, Tiffany behind (no great hardship), and heads for Hollywood in a tatty old VW bus.   Once in Hollywood, our innocent, country cowboy hero (who sleeps with his Stetson over his face) has a series of adventures ...  Basically, "Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom" is a romance. The novel may be coated with a veneer of the trailer-trash genre, but it boils down to a romance, swaddled with some intrigue, and ne'er do well types. This novel reads better than a Harlequin romance, but with lines such as: "laughing lips that had never felt the needle's collagen sting," and "she was not the swiftest deer in the concrete forest," you should get my point. In all fairness, I should point out that I generally do not read romances, so I was destined to be disappointed in this novel. But for other potential readers, the overwhelming romance aspect of this novel should be mentioned. I did, however, enjoy the character of Benjamin Lonetree. He was an original creation in the novel--displacedhuman 
 At 624 pages, What to Eat certainly looks appealing and authoritative. However, while Nestle's book does contain some good information, it doesn't live up to it's bold title. I was expecting more of a treatise on healthful foods, mixed with an equal part of what foods to avoid. Instead, Nestle focuses entirely on what to avoid, brushing off, for example, vegetables with a single, scant chapter. Now, I could see the value even in this approach, but the organization of the book (a meandering collection of chapters that do not flow coherently) and Nestle's odd tone of not giving a very clear opinion of what to avoid or not to avoid, mars the book's practical value significantly. A better book that fulfills her objective more thoroughly is Andrew Weil's Eating Better for Optimum Health, which covers almost entirely the same topics, while being thoughtfully organized and much more informative. 
 I highly recommend the book "The Highly Sensitive Child" by Elaine Aron to get a different perspective (more positive) on the out of sync child 
 Don't waste your money on this book - just reread  Make the connectio 
 I wish I had read some of the reviews prior to wasting my time on this inaccurate collection of self absorbed drivel. My husband and I were fortunate enough to have lived for two years in the center of Paris. I enjoy reading everything about Paris from Alistair Horne to Patricia Wells and am always looking for new insights. This book was a big disappointment that never captured even the slightest essence of Paris. If Gopnik was a painter his palette would be limited to a tiresome grey.  
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book really did nothing for me. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big TD Jakes fan, I think he's definitely an anointed prophet from God, and he's a fantastic minister. But being a great minister doesn't necessarily make a person a great writer. He's blessed w/ an uncanny ability to preach and teach on healing and deliverance from life's painful experiences, but when it comes to putting this thoughts on paper, he just doesn't seem to be able to get his points across clearly, directly and succinctly. For example, he doesn't stay focused on the subject at hand because of his excessive use of metaphors, hyperbole and superfluous information throughout this book. A good writer uses metaphors only to set an example or to illustrate a significant point in order to paint a clear picture in the reader's mind, not use them in every other sentence. For a while there, I wasn't sure if I was reading a book by TD Jakes or Dr. Seuss.  Another problem I have w/ this book is that it seems like it is addressing little boys or, at best, men who have failed at every kind of human relationship possible - i.e., husband/wife, son/father, father/son, male/male friends, male/female friends, etc. He does however, provide a great outline on man's various relationships (with himself, with God, with his children, etc.), but his delivery is so out of focus. In fact, he even devotes an entire chapter smack in the middle of the book about money and finances. What does that have to do w/ how I deal w/ my "He-Motions"? Besides, he's already written a book a few years ago entitled "The Greatest Investment-Faith, Family & Finance", therefore it was unnecessary to bring up the subject of money/finance again in "He-Motions".  The info contained in this book is just too elementary for me. He doesn't offer any real soultions on dealing w/ my "He-Motions", and the examples he provides just don't deal w/ anything that I have ever dealt with personnally. I was really expecting something much deeper and substantive. But all I got here was a bunch of fluff. C'mon Bishop, enough of the lame stories and metaphors, give us some substance. I don't mean to sound too critical, but I'm just not feelin' this book. 
 Go and buy some Bobby Darin, Tony Bennet or in fact anyone who can sing. If I had composed some of the great music  on this Cd I wouldn't have given Costello the permission to murder  the songs in the way he does 
 I couldn't figure out if this was a novel or a liberal political op-ed piece.  Which is it Mr. Woods?    Two Dollar Bill pretty much follows Woods' imagination of the normal Stone Barrington agenda, with the inclusion of several underwritten and hidden political personal opinions.  Installing political opionions in his books have been common practice for Mr. Woods, I would know because I have read EVERY SINGLE ONE of his novels prior to Two Dollar Bill.    Political opinions are all fair and well...when incorporated into a politically focused novel, which this isn't by any means, but it would be hard to know it by the shear number of snide, unrelated, and personal attacks Woods makes concerning Bush Administation policies and general Conservatives in America.  To his credit, Woods did respond to an e-mail I sent him inquiring as to why he did this, but couldn't provide ANY justification for it.  Merely that it was his right to do so.  And you are correct Mr. Woods, it is your right to do so...just like it was my right to make the conscience decision not to read any more of your books, which I am happy to say that I haven't.  And coming from a person (me) who has ALL of your novels (with the exception of one) in hard back, most of which are signed, is quite a statement to make.  I've been a fan of yours since the early 90's, but cannon continue to be with your recent, and quite obvious, politically motivated agenda.  Good day to you 
 ...it is very poorly researched.  The map on the cover is wrong for starters.  This is Mediterranean food according to Joanne Weir (not a person who grew up with Med food) who obviously has a very shallow understanding of the food of the region.  This book proves that breezing through these countries as a tourist can not turn you into a serious cookbook author, or even a half-way decent one.   .. 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 This book is a mess.  The thesis presented in the introduction is a rambling essay on the importance of followers and historical forces in leadership, which might leave the reader less informed about leadership  than before he/she read it.  What's worse is that the intro has nothing at  all to do with the rest of the book (which is marginal in it's own right).   The case studies are way too short and are made even less informative by  Wills habit of not even mentioning the leader until five or six pages of  nonsense. My overall feeling of this book is that it was poorly researched  and badly written.  I wonder (in all seriousness) whether Wills knows  anything at all about some of the people he writes about.  Skip this one. I  suggest Lincoln on Leadership instead: it provides the rudiments of  leadership with clear, well researched examples 
 This is the absolute worst solutions manual ever written!  There are way too many skipped problems.  The solutions that actually are given do not help the reader to understand the material at all.  Advice: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! 
 Terry Pratchett is wonderful and I own everything he's ever written (or co-written)(well, not everything - I don't have his shopping lists). My fanhood began at a time when his non-Discworld books were not available in the US. It was in the bibliography darn it...finally found it via a used-books site reference to a bemused London 2nd-hand bookseller's place (his e-mail: "Are you sure?"). Paid triple the cover price plus shipping, so yes, I trust you recognize a fanatic here?   In addition, I much prefer cats over all other possible pets. I even like Jolliffe cartoons.   If anyone was ever more prejudiced in favor of a book before opening it...  It has its hilarious moments - I don't think Terry (may I call you Terry? Thank you, PS, great stuff, keep it up) could write an obituary without having a hilarious moment or two - but I found the majority of the writing cumbersome. Belabored. Shorn of repetitions and needless build-ups, this would make a wonderful humor column, but book-length, it suffers.   It was detrimentally inaccurate about cats. Well, it wasn't supposed to be a textbook. But, for example, the whole chapter about domestic cats being into time-travel loses a lot of punch when you know that there are plenty of wild feline species (about a quarter of them) that are small and domestic-looking. Making the argument that there's no sensible link between a cat and a lion (as opposed to between a dog and a wolf) is egregious. And there are other errors like that, which detract from the jokes by undermining their premises.  I've read the book three times over the years, thinking maybe it was just a Mood Thing, but I've yet to come away feeling like it was worth wading through all that for the laughs. My suspicion is that Terry really loves his wife and didn't exercise the same level of constructive criticism on her text that he did on himself (as with his rewrite of "Carpet People"). Or maybe Lyn is the really funny one and she forgave Terry too much? Either way, I'd say this is his weakest work (yes, I've read "Strata," too).                
 I can understand the fascination -- an attractive tenor with a voice that can both make you drowsy and startle you awake.  But Mr. Mcdermott needs to search beyond the notes to find a sense of life in each song.  His  interpretations are anything but inspired.  Seldom does he move beyond the  score to any sense of discovery of what separates the characters to which  each of these songs belong.  Instead, we get a litany of vibrato which, no  thanks to the orchestrations, feels like musac without any kind of  distinction between songs.  What the album needed was a producer worth  their salary helping to coach this fine vocalist into new explorations of  these mostly over-recorded songs

 Another "feel-good" book directed at lesbians who insist fathers aren't necessary in the raising of boys. They are SO WRONG. Unfortunately, their guinea pigs are the children. The author limits her samples to white, upper class lesbians and single mothers. To say her sample is skewed is an understatement. 
 I read Q firt then read N, R, D and a few others. I just finished P and boy was I disappointed. The ending as others have stated is not tied up nicely like usual. In a few of the other novels there were a few strings left hanging which I can forgive. This one there were way to much information found out at the end that didnt figure into the ending at all. What about the sister of the juvie friend? What happened to her? Maybe I missed it. I am pretty good about going back and finding details I may have missed. I did not like the character development in this one. I was surprised that a PI like Ms. Millhone would not do thorough background checks on people that come into her life, professionally or personally.   I like to find an author and read a book. If I like it I get more of them waiting in the wings. This one was a disappointment and had it been the first letter I picked it would be the last.   Sorry Ms. Grafton, this just wasn't the best hours of reading I have had.  
 The storyline was weak with very forgettable characters.  The heroine was a complaining inept airhead and her "Devirgination" should not take so long and then we have to listen to her complain about it for hours afterward.  And Georgie? who came across as a freakish stuttering child was reenactted by the narrator in an annoying stuttering whine.  One character was actually described has having a magnificent bosom what is that? I can't help but picture this poor "regency" woman toppling over to reach for her tea. 
 The publisher must have thought that anything Puzo wrote was gold as this  appeared a few years ago and rightfully disappeared.  The main characters, Francis Xavier Kennedy, his friends and staff are completely unconvincing and cardboard cutouts. The assassination of his daughter holds no suspense or regret as she is a cardboard character like the rest of them.  Needless characters and unnecessary plot lines appear to confuse the reader. Remember that 1/3 of "The Godfather" was junk about  Jules the doctor and his love affair with Sonny Corleone's lover. The movie thankfully cut out the waste and was the better without it. "The Fourth K" is all fat and no meat. They are re-releasing it to coincide with  "The Godfather Returns" and terrorists assaults on US soil.  Avoid  this book!  
 The history of the making of the Nancy Drew books is fascinating, and I did enjoy reading that part of this book. However, the author simply could not keep her point of view (that the Nancy Drew authors and creators were modern feminists, showing the great big male world what women could do back then) when the facts simply did not support this point of view. The author even says that the writers SAY they didn't think they were being pioneering or feminists, yet, the author tells, us, even though they say there weren't, they are, and Rehak insists on it. I can't understand how an editor could have allowed so much bias to enter into this book unless the editor, too, shared this slanted point of view.  So, read this book for the history, that part is fascinating. But take all the feminism with a grain of salt. Mildred Wirt Benson is a fasincinating lady, but her intention with Nancy Drew was simply to write a great story and earn a living. She was not trying to impress any men or show the male world that women rule, as the author seems to imply 
 I bought this book because I liked the idea behind it, introduce the thinkers in a comic book fashion. Also, I thought the "Introducing Postmodernism" was good. But this one on Foucault is a great  dissapointment. The captions that narrate Foucault's development are mostly  confusing: the explanation of the ideas just aren't clear enough, and the  biographical anecdotes are mostly irrelevant. This doesn't give one a good  understanding of what Foucault was trying to do, what his books tried to  say, how his life influenced his work and v.v., and why, in the end, his  "work has become a straight jacket," as the author asserts 
 I am sure the original cut isn't as bad as the unrated uncut version, all I know is I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for it to end.  This has got to be one of the worst films I've seen in a long, long time.  The cussing was just over and over and got so redundant and stupid I thought I was in a junior high school boys locker room after ten 13 year olds had downed a couple beers each.  The bathroom type talk was just too much.  It's not that the message of the story was bad, woman should be treated with respect and sex is not something to be taken lightly, it's just that being so over the top in rude and crude behavior and talk wasn't necessary to make the point.    Anyway I don't recommend this at all, however if you must, don't watch the long version. 
 I am in fact the "yuppie scum" that many of the reviewers have such disdain for (why, only they know).  In any event, I, unhappy in my present career, was looking for a book that would inspire me to make a change.  Don't be deceived, this is not a self-help book.  The stories of the individuals in the book are half-baked, uninspiring and in certain instances go unresolved.  There are no useful insights or "gems" to be taken and used in our personal lives.  The writing by Po (or editing by his publisher) is disjointed and confusing.  I could only get through about three-quarters of this drivel before putting it down 
  Physical labor sucks.  Okay, you know that, I know that, even Paris and Nicole (thanks to their reality show) have gotten it through their puny little brainage, but it's news to Barbara Ehrenreich, whose previous stints as Ph.D earner, activist and writer did not expose her to the grubby working world of dirty hands and aching muscles that most of us have managed to live through.   It's a shame. This could have been such a great book, but B.E.'s got a preconceived agenda (welfare reform is never gonna work!) and an axe to grind (unless we raise minimum wage to 14 bucks an hour!).  To prove her point she goes undercover for the better part of a year, taking entry-level, low-skilled work while staying in expensive short-term housing. Of course, she could of just crunched numbers -"Let's see, 7 bucks an hour times 40 hours, while my pretend rent is $200 a week...carry the zero...nope, can't afford it" - but that would have just given her a puny little 2,000 word article for Mother Jones.  Book deals, on the hand, require more work, more commitment, but think of the royalties, so off she goes, just like Paris and Nicole, to work as a waitress, maid and Wal-Mart associate.  At least until it gets too hard.  B.E.'s got a litany of complaints - my feet hurt, my back hurts, piss tests are demeaning, my boss is a jerk, customers are rude, my back huuuurts - and seems to think that only the minimum wager has to suffer such indignities.  News flash, Barbara!  Every job is stressful in its own way.  I'm a RN and it's a rare day I don't come home feeling like I've been beat with a stick.  I've been verbally abused and cussed out more times than I can remember, and that's just by the docs.  I've been pee'd on, poo'd on, run ragged, and called  "girl" by my stupidvisor (My response: I'm older than you, and I've had sex, and I'm pretty sure you haven't by the looks of you, so, boss, who's the "girl" here, and who's the WOMAN.)  I will admit I get paid significantly more for my putting-up-with-BS than the average Walmartian does for his.  But then again I earned a college degree, I had to pass a difficult competency test and I work under the constraints of my nursing license, for which I had to get fingerprinted and background checked.  So that's why I get paid more than a minimum wager, even though our jobs, probably 97% of the time, are comparable.  I'll give B.E. 2 stars for her writing.   It's smart and witty and at times, she borders on hilarious, especially when she's mocking the minorities and poor that she claims to want to help.  Hey, I didn't say she was compassionate, I said she was funny.    B.E., if you're reading this, consider this angle next time you want to write a book about not getting by.  Write a book about being poor and uninsured.  Write a book about wanting to advance your position in life, but not being able to, because as soon as you take that better paying job or go into business for yourself you'll be kicked off medicaid, and you'll run out of inhalers for your asthmatic kid, and you'll have to listen to him wheeze all night, and when you take him to the charity clinic a week from Tuesday, because that's the only time the retired charity doc can see you, you won't be able to afford the prescription since it's over a hundred bucks for one inhaler, so then you have to quit your job so you can qualify for medicaid.  Then when you're done with that, write another book, this time about the lack of decent public transportation in the majority of the U.S., and how this results in needing a car to survive, which leads to excessive personal income spent on cars, more tax money spent on roads and highways, to say nothing of the hidden costs of car accidents and obesity from driving everywhere because it's too dangerous, with all the cars on the road, to ride a bike.  Those books would be worth reading.   
 When I saw the cast of this film, I hired it. It wasn't bad but I can't say that I was overwhelmed with enthusiasm. It was a bit slow although the surprising twist at the end makes you think how you make emotive assumptions based on the facts which are often quite erroneous. I won't say more so as not to spoil it for you but it wasn't up to my expectations 
 I'm a big James Woods fan and came across this movie here. I have never heard of it and it is not available at any of the video stores in my area. So I ordered it because of all the positive reviews here, but wound up turning it off in the middle. It was real long, uninteresting, and was taking too long for anything to happen. If you haven't seen this movie before, I would recommend you not buy this yet, like I did. Try checking out "Indictment" or "Dirty Pictures", two of Woods's best movies 
 I wanted to like this book as it is so highly praised by people I admire.  It was a selection for our church book club and I'm glad I had exposure to Father Nouwen's interpretation of the message of the Prodigal Son, one of my favorite New Testament passages.  Unfortunately it did not arouse much spirituality in  me.  I felt that Father Nouwen overworked the connectedness between his own experiences and the biblical message.  It was a long slog  to finish the book which engendered guilt in me for not being more moved by Father Nouwen's words.  He was a dedicated and thoughtful Christian who lead an exemplary life of charity and service but his message here was diminished by repetition.  Prudent editing would have resulted in a more readable and inspirational book.   
 I dont know why amazon forgot to include them here - anyway: the reader's reviews of the 5th ed. of this book speak for themself ... Check it out yourself.  Also, it is rather interesting that Nina Segal - according to the "editorial" review - never ever worked abroad. (That sounds a little bit like Condi and George W. telling the rest of the world how to fight terrorism and introduce democracy ... 
 There is such a depth of information that could be said about this routine retrograde period of Mercury.  3 times a year it visits us and there is so much misunderstanding surrounding it.  This book simply adds to that.  Not a lot of meat.  More information about when it will happen.  I was disappointed.  I found nothing new in it, and an emphasis that missed much of the inherent repsect due a mercury retrograde.  I'll keep looking, because this one won't stay on my shelf 
 I returned the activation card without activating because I was misled by the description of the product.   I understood that the eAutoRepair activation would be for a multitude of "vehicles from 1983 to Present", but the card is for only ONE vehicle per subscription.........not mentioned in the description 
 First of all I want everyone to notice that this is only VOLUME 2.  Volume one is no longer available anywhere.  Thus, making this book fairly useless.  The only thing that it's really good at it showing different stiles between professional comic book inkers.  It nice to page through and I don't regret buyin it but it is not necessary for an artist's library 
 If this were a satirical view of Regency books, I might have bought the far-fetched storyline, the flat, idiotic characters, and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot.  As I rather suspect it is not a satire - Catherine Coulter being a best-selling Romance novelist - it was disappointing to say the very least.  I only, I repeat, only listened to it in its entirety because I hadn't brought anything else to listen to at work one day.  If you like historical romance that's fun and funny, try Katie MacAlister's book "Improper English", or for some more serious historical fiction, check out Phillippa Gregory's Wideacre series 
 Hello to all those who have read this book.  After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something.  WHy are you so set against God and Christianity?  One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity.  Christianity is not some weird religion,  it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much.  Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.  Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him.  Thank you 
 I've read most of DP's books; some I've loved & read over & over again; some were so boring that I just had to skip-through.... I'm sorry to say that I had to skip-through the first 2/3 of the first story in this book -- Wedding in White. It was not as sensual or gripping as some of her better works. Only the last 1/3 of the story was gripping, and I would give about 2.5 stars for this story....  What was worse was the second story in this book -- Circle of Gold. It just didn't make any kind of sense! There were just so many contradictions in this story that made me believe that DP must have written this one while she was dozing-off, and I can't believe that anyone who has the least bit of analytical mind would give this story more than a 1 star!  
 I am going to build muy custom house and I want to do it according to the Feng Shui. I was expecting to find many Feng Shui floor plans samples...well let me tell you that not, it has not many Feng Shui floor plans, such a few, and most of them do not match what the book says. I mean that most of the foor plans are not according to Feng Shui bagua grid (occidental), i.e.: bathroom is Wealth area, when it is known in all schools that bathroom can't be placed there. I found just 1 floor plan, so it is not worthly to get this book if you are looking for Feng Shui floor plans. 
 There should be a note in the description somewhere that you will be unable to PRINT any worksheets from the workbook.  What good is a workbook that you CANNOT WORK in???  And I can't even get my money back.  I am completely unsatisfied 
 The very title for the book - "I Con" - despite its cleverness, should reveal the lack of any objectivity, or class for that matter, from the authors, Jeffrey S. Young & William L. Simon. I could best describe this book as a shoddy pastiche of ambiguous-sounding facts, poor research, colored by a palpable disdain for [arguably the most interesting legend of our time] Steve Jobs.  What is really distasteful is that this antipathy of the authors towards Steve Jobs, seems 'personal'; which, in a democratic sense, may be alright i guess, [but only] UNTIL facts begin to wear thin, and the research seems doctored, leaving the rants sounding hollow, unsavory and shrill. And the facts aren't well-strung together either!  From the very opening description in the book, which overdramatizes and harps on about the return of a "reformed" Steve Jobs, to Apple in 1997 (as though the most unfathomably impossible phenomenon in the history of humankind had occurred), to the careful selection of maliciously undertoned quotations, and quite often blatant slanders about Jobs, the book appears to be a collation of 'hate diaries' maintained by two wannabe authors, whose sole purpose in writing this book seems to be to fuel an anti-Steve sentiment among its readers!  If you happen to be one of those people, who finds some twisted pleasure in those idle conversations that involve scandalmongering [especially Steve Jobs], then this book should provide ample fuel for your negative energy 
 This book has a shocking, last minute twist a la Sixth Sense.  The surprise in the movie, Sixth Sense, however, works.  Your view of the story is suddenly turned on its head and you're left wanting to go back to look for the clues that you missed before.  In the case of this book, the twist was completely unbelievable and even felt a bit obscene.  To make it every more frustrating, I thought the book was  actually a good read, and I kept reading thinking the mystery's solution would be revealed and the intriguing  questions would somehow be tied up. Instead, the ending left me rolling my eyes and feeling duped rather than entertained. This Beach Road leads to nowhere 
 I really wanted to love this camera. The camera is compact and could fit into the pocket of my jeans!   I did plenty of research before choosing to buy this camera so I expected all the quarks of the unit mentioned in other reviews. The 30 frames per second uninterlaced video is good - of course it's not as good as full resolution 60 fields per second video... but the unit fits into my pocket! Another huge plus is that each "shot" is an individual file that can be dragged off the unit and onto a PC using a USB cable. No further processing - the file just copies and plays in Quicktime, etc. Another great feature is the ability to zoom while recording a movie, which most point and shoot cameras that record video will not allow you to do.  Now the sad part; Amazon has shipped me two units - both with bad pixels on the LCD and CCD. The bad pixels on the LCD, according to the manual, are expected and "Not a malfunction"; I disagree with that. For the cost of the unit there should be no bad pixels on the LCD monitor. The HUGE problem is the bad pixels on the CCD! This results with white pixels being recorded on the files; this is compounded by the "image stabilization". The image stabilization shifts the image the CCD receives around in attempt to stabilize a shot of video - and it works great! However, as the video is shifted and stabilized the white pixels are shifted around the screen as well. It's almost like there are flies moving through every single shot you record.  The bad CCD is the reason why I can't love the C6... I gave up hope and sent both back to Amazon. I'm not sure what I will buy now.

 This was one of the first books in a good while that I almost didn't finish. It is, without a doubt, one of the worst books I have read in a long time. The style of the writing is cramped, and hard to comprehend at  times. I also found it hard to keep track of most of the people in the  book. I do have some pity for her, it must be hard to write a biography of  such a mean spirited man 
 Sandford has done his best to be "fair" to the insufferable and untalented Paul McC.   And yet he bends over backwards (or maybe forwards) to say nice things about the even less talented Linda and even seems to have a soft spot for Heather Mills (Milks) McCartney, who has become a spokesman for IHOP recently.     When will somebody come along and really tell the truth about this bozo?   
 Dull and uninspiring, listening to this CD I couldn't see what distinguished the Doves from the other insipid sound-a-like bands that plague the modern music scene. If you like The White Stripes, Franz Ferdinand, Arctic Monkeys, The Killers then be grateful that they've saved rock music from boring dross like this 
 A MOUSE LOOSES HIS FAMILY MEMBERS & THEN FINDS THEM.  IT'S JUST AN OK BOOK, VERY UNDERSERVING OF ALL THE 5-STAR REVIEWS.  A BETTER MOUSE BOOK WOULD BE- IF YOU GIVE A MOUSE A COOKIE. 
 It would seem that the last batch of books produced by the Asimov aren't quite what they use to be.  I'm still and always will be an avid fan, but the last two books in the foundation series were a bit of a let down.  Though Foundation Forward (in the timeline between Prelude to Foundation and Foundataion) was relatively the best of his last 3.  -chri 
 No matter Caldwell's argument for focusing--almost exclusively--on New York City (it's easier to research NYC, he says on the last page of the intro), his subtitle suggests a wider range. James and Wharton have told us more about NYC manners than Caldwell, trapped inside nonfiction's perimeters and by a bloodless style, can approach. Looking to the rest of the United States, then, would have had the meritorious effect of opening his topic up beyond the much-overdone 
 Guerrilla Warfare: Che Guevara by Ernesto Guevara  Warning this book seems intended to make martyrs  Over the years this book has proved far more useful to mislead potential guerrillas than to educate them.  The handmade weaponry described are ineffective and or failed tools of war. The tactics suggested have led to defeat in the Americas and in Africa. The cause described has never helped the poor and down trodden.  One could readily ponder if the real intent was to make martyrs for the cause of mythical communist paradise. One wonders  how many, aside from the author, died violently because of all the above.          
 Yes, some of the stories were good, but even the better ones were uniformly depressing. Please be warned that selection after morbid selection is based on grief-stricken parents and dead, missing, kidnapped and/or murdered and mangled children (sometimes entire pits of them); of the dead children stories, the "Buckets" (ghosts of aborted children) offering several other reviewers mentioned was the MOST cheerful. I'm sorry I bought it, and even sorrier that I waded through the entire thing in the hope that there had to be at least one gem of entertainment in there. I like horror as a genre, and rarely part with books, but this one hit the trashcan. 
 When you "search inside" the book while still on Amazon before purchasing the PDF of Hegel's _Phenomenology_, you are provided with pages from Miller's translation in the viewer. When one has opened the PDF which one can download upon purchase, however, it is not the Miller translation, but rather an UNATTRIBUTED translation. My goal in purchasing the PDF of the Phenomenology was to use it as a word-search for the actual physical book, a way of finding passages I had read but couldn't remember the location of. It can be used that way, partially, but only indirectly, because it is a different translation--it will only help you find passages in the Miller if Miller happened to have chosen the exact same word(s) as the secret translator of the PDF-version! That's the problem. The translation provided in the PDF will furthermore be difficult to cite, given that NO TRANSLATOR is credited with having brought the 404 pages into English (in addition, no year for the translation is provided either--at any rate, if these attributions are provided in the PDF, they are not easy to find, because I have not found them yet). I also went to digireads.com, which is listed in the PDF as its source, but their listing for the book says nothing about the source of the translation. [After a quick search on the web, it appears the translation is the same as the one provided for free on line on marxists dot org -- click on "reference" and then "hegel" to get a listing of all his works. That translation is listed on that webpage as being the Harper Torchbooks' edition of the Phenomenology, from 1807. 
 This book is a decent overall, 1000 ft view of options for acquiring inventory to sell on eBay.  It presents the 'you should consider' rather than the 'step one, step two', which is fair seeing that no one answer can fit all.  Granted, this wasn't intended to give you a list of manufacturers, wholesalers, or even a comprehensive list of online services; but just when you think something tangible (as opposed to purely conceptual) is about to appear on the next page, you get a 'not within the scope of this book' or 'buy our other book XYZ for that info'  Also be warned of the DOBA ads threaded throughout this book (one of the authors is the CEO)   One 'tangible' piece of info I couldve used is in the area of importing. The book goes into the general process of working with manufacturers and wholesalers. You'd think getting the inventory is a considerable aspect of managing inventory, however the book simply recommends contacting a customs broker and stops.  Then points to another one of their books for $24.95.  On top of it all, there had to have been at least 50 pages in this book created out of pure repetition.  There were a number of places I thought I had reread, only to notice it had been covered multiple times.  The unorthodox organization of the book helped lead to this, fat margins, etc, but I'm sure its no accident..a 250 pager sells more copies.  Decent book, but not well executed.  I definitely will not consider any other publication in the series 
 Most of this book is a listing of some whale watching companies with litte infomation of real value.  Which ones are good?  No information about that.  But there is information if their boat serves food, which they almost all do.  Plus this information is old.  No good pictures and no quality information about whales.  I was completely disappointed in this suppossed "5 star" book.  Don't buy this book -- do searching on line instead 
 This is D.H. Lawrence at his hobby horse again. He gives a portrayal of the risen Jesus after the crucifixion who is tired of life . . . weary of it all, with the life force at an all-time low. What can save him? Sex, of  course. What else? It's the same old song-and-dance. Lawrence seems to  think that the answer to all of life's problems is sexual union, which  makes about as much sense to me as regarding vegetable curry as the meaning  of life. Sex has it's place, to be sure, but I don't understand the primacy  that Lawrence ascribes to it in each and every one of his novels. In  certain instances, sex can revive a sense of purpose or ebbing energy, but  it cannot and will not aid anyone in a sense of world-weariness. If  attempted it will just be like trying to give live into a dead horse. It  would probably only make one feel all the more disgusted with existence  rather than giving one a sense of rejuvenation, as Sartre so adequately  demonstrates in his "Nausea". All, in all, i felt the whole  attempt was kind of silly. The Christians will get mad, the Lawrencians  will love it, but it is really just another testimony to one man's  inability to make sense of live in anyway other than genital terms 
 I made it half way through before piercing my eardrums with sharpened pencils.  If you can buy the karaoke version, this might be pretty good, otherwise you will get more artistry from the latest Yanni cd.  The vocals are so twee even a kindergartner would blush in shame 
 The spurious claims of publicity hungry Russian journalist have been checked and disproved by Max Müller from Oxford University who at the beginning of his research was sympathetic to this thesis. If such old document about Issa (Jesus) existed as Notovitch claims it would have been recorded in Kandur and Tandjur, the catalogues of Tibetan literature. Dr Archibald Douglas disproved that Notowitch even visited monastery of Himis. There is no historical or archeological data supporting claim that Jesus ever went beyond Palestine. Moreover, there is absolutely no hint in His teaching that would even remotly resamble Eastern teachings, nor did the xenophobic Pharisees ever accused Him of such influence. The only support is based on revelations from spirits pretenting to be Jesus, Mary or other spiritual guide in touch with Elizabeth Prophets or Edgar Cayce 
 I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous.  It did not come across as a "Sixth Sense" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field.  It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all.  The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way.  I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it.  It didn't.  Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character.   This book was a huge disappointment!  I would not recommend that anyone waste their time.  In the end, when all is "revealed" nothing makes sense.  No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!  
 The first section of this course was fantastic -- they pronounced each French phrase very slowly, had you repeat each syllable, and then sped it up to full speed. However, after the first few lessons the slow, careful pronunciation ceased, and the French came flying at me too quickly to hear clearly. This is supposed to be an audio-based course, so the book is not very inclusive and offered little help in deciphering the speakers. I'm very dissapointed 
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 When I started doing research for my honors thesis, I was excited to see how many books there were on the difference between American and Japanese business environments. I was immediately dissapointed; each and every book was filled with generalizations based on anecdotal evidence and weak extrapolations from history and language. Although Haru Yamada's book is an exception in that it actually has real data in it, that data is merely the analysis of a three-person American meeting and a three person Japanese meeting. That is hardly a representative sample.   The first thing you have to learn when attempting to interact with another culture is that culture does affect the way we communicate, and that bad experiences are often the result of misunderstanding. For someone with no experience with Japan, reading a book like this might be helpful. "Oh, OK. These are the things that I should watch out for." But there is always the danger that people will take the contents as gospel. In my experience, expecting that the Japanese will act a certian way only increases frustration and actually impedes progress. Its much better to start off on a clean slate, and to keep in mind that culture might throw off your "gut" impressions, so give people the benefit of the doubt.   What I would desperately like to see is a real linguistic study with hard conversation-derived data that merely attempts to discover what people DO, rather than how they ARE. As soon as you start talking about what an entire nation of people is like you officially leave the realm of sciences and enter the realm of stereotypes. 
 There's no shame in not understanding the details of modern naval telecommunications, or the aerodynamics of flight, or how flight control systems work on aircraft, or the physics of modern weapons, or small-unit military tactics. They're all complex subjects. But why would you showcase those details when you hadn't done the research to write about them in an authentic way? Why would his editor not get someone to review these technical details? I had to drop this book about 75% of the way through it because I couldn't take the inaccuracies any longer. What a disappointment 
 I gave this book one star because there is no option for zero stars.  This book is an insult to all sales professionals. The gist of the book is that call reluctance is some type of mental disorder and all salespeople who don't want to cold call have the disorder.    But what really made me want to burn this book is the authors' suggestion that the biggest symptom of this so-called disorder is when salespeople dress very well. Excuse me? I'm sorry but in sales, your appearance counts, and to state that dressing well indicates that a salesperson has a mental disorder is nonsense! Hopkins, Gitomer, and all the great sales authors who have a track record to prove that they walk their talk will tell you to wear great clothes and that your appearance matters.  I'd like to see one of the authors walk into an appointment dressed like a slob, and get the sale.  The sick part of it all is that many sales trainers have sold out and joined the cottage industry of teaching so-called sales reluctance 'cures.' Don't waste your money on this book unless you too want to sell out and preach this garbage and stab your fellow salespeople in the back 
 After hearing "I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa 
 Overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your Panasonic LX1 or LX2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  First, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  There is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2" wide.  Also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  Finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  This might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use.  
 This book basically boils down to arguing that only global capitalism can solve Africa's problems.    Guest trawls through a litany of Africa's various humiliations, quickly excluding colonialism and developed countries' trading practises as major contributing factors and presents any solution attempt other than strict laisser faire economics as the sinister workings of some cruel and corrupt natives.  There's a patronising tone to the book and sometimes one feels that Guest approaches Africans with a missionary's zeal, waving a copy of the Economist in a way reminiscent of his forefathers (except they waved copies of the bible). His devotion to capitalism seems almost fanatical. For example, when considering the problem of rising unemployment in South Africa he argues that it is simply "largely a consequence of the government's efforts to protect workers" (p 223).  
 I am now the laughing stock of my friends, why because I payed money for the lamest excuse of a 8 bit console tv plug and play ever.  My atari plug and play has better graphics and feel than this.  There are bars that have the projected GTEE screen that makes the game all most real I feel my little tv had to much resolution for this toy making it feel not so real in fact in two words "it sucks".   
 As others have said, it's really a shame that you can't rate the film and the DVD seperately.  I didn't buy this sooner because of the closed captioning.  I had read that the problem is fixed, but I just got mine, and it's not.  I don't even want a dub.  I prefer subtitles, but these are ridiculous for those of us who can hear - quite obtrusive.  The film's Wikipedia article claims that "after receiving numerous complaints, DreamWorks released a statement saying that unsatisfied customers could exchange their DVDs for properly subtitled ones, postage paid; and that version 4 already had the proper subtitling."  The link no longer works, and if I can't get it replaced, I'll either sell this or get a partial refund 
 I read these 5 star reviews and the synopsis and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I like odd. I read the first few pages/chapters and thought it was "different", but kept waiting to be taken away to a dreamland carnaval. I forced myself to keep going, thinking it was just a slow-starter but I was never seduced like the other reviewers. Very interesting premise, but I was quite disappointed 
 Nothing is clear in this book, it is not organized and not well writing. Filled with charts that are dispersed wherever and not easy to understand.  Frankly it is an advertising of the Investor Business Daily, IBD, please subscribe and you will make money, I lost my respect to Mr. O'Neils when he ended the book by the testimonials from Investors. He even wrote if you deal with a broker who didn't attend his class!! It is a worst investor. 
 This show is amazing.  The sets, costumes, dance, and characters are wonderfully penned and created.  However, the CD leaves much to be desired.  George Hearn doesn't have enough "gay" to make a believable drag performer.  His version of "I Am What I Am" while true to the character, is not as beautiful or faltering as Albin should be.  If you live in NYC, or are going, I reccomend the current revival, which needs a CD, as it is fantastic!  However, I am sad that this is currently the only documenation of this show 
 Let's see. Ken Starr wastes the public money attacking Bill Clinton with false accusations while at the same time siding with KON-servative Mitch Mcconnel of KY to allow for more corrupt campaigns as if there aren't any already !!! This book is a perfect tool for neconservative NAZIS to enjoy and drool over but is otherwise useless trash for the rest of us who are already facing mass destruction by Bush/Cheney/Rove/Delay and GOP with of course a spineless opposition that barely got together to defend Clinton but easily caved into and defended Bush the liar-in-chief ! 
 Any man who reads this book stands a good chance of becoming an avowed woman hater. The letter from Tanya at the Baltimore methadone clinic still has me feeling nauseous hours after reading it. The scariest thing is that there are actually people like this, and people who like to read about it 
 I suppose if you like a lot of pretty graphics this book is for you.  Otherwise I recommend you go to gamefaq and just download a walkthrough there.  The book is pretty disorganized and suffers from poor editing.  You have to bounce all around to find anything.  I got the feeling the people at Prima were just craming everything they could find into this book so they could justify the price.  You will find help in this book but it is not worth the price. 
 First, as always, the disclaimer. I am a regional author (Suomalaiset: People of the Marsh; ISBN 0972005064) and, like all authors, prone to fighting fits of envy. So, take what I am about to write with a grain of salt. I loved "Cold Mountain". Loved the premise,the historical truth, the characters, the setting, and the writing. I looked forward to the much hyped second effort by Mr. Frazier. The good news is that his writing is still exemplary. By that, I mean the man certainly knows how to turn a phrase. But that's about all I can say, in terms of positives, about this effort. The plot seems overblown and quite frankly, totally preposterous. The main character, Will, is thrown into wars, and disasters, and inclement weather, and every other kind of malady, only to survive, essentially unchanged and unscathed, while all those around him fall or fail. His ability to amass a fortune and hundreds of thousands of acres of land seems, given his humble beginnings, to strain even my vivid imagination. The descriptions of the landscape are lovely but lost in a plot that has no point. The first quarter of the book, the beginnings of a love affair between Will and Claire, the love of Will's life, has promise. Then, for the greater part of half of the novel, we are immersed endlessly in tedium surrounding Will and his adopted Indian tribe, the only point of which seems is to convince us that Will's greed isn't selfish, but done for the good his Red Brothers and Sisters. Far too late, and in a strained and surrealistic manner, the story comes back to Will and Claire. But by then, my patience was worn thin and the return to the real story, the interpersonal struggle between the lovers, had lost its appeal. Two stars might be a little light but that's how I see it.  
 I want to start off by saying I am a huge fan of Little's works and have amassed a collection of his books. He is an author who will go the road less traveled and I am all for that.  With this in mind I looked at the synopsis on the back cover and opted to give it a try. Bad Mistake!  Don't get me wrong, I found myself interested in Bob's dilemma, though a bit confused as to how he got that way, and was hanging on to every word in order to satisfy my curiousity as to how Bob, the book's protagonist, dealt with these challenges and waiting to see if it would get any worse for him. It did and I sympathized at first.  When the book starts it's downhill slide, in my opinion, is when he meets up later on with characters who are having similar problems. I spent the remaining time reading the book,not out of enjoyment, but wondering to myself as to how many different ways are they going to rehash their plight, causing my sympathy level to ebb as the situations go from the ridiculous to the sublime. For instance, towards the end, a full scale invasion on the  White House complete with tanks and ammunition,with only a small blurb mentioned of it on the TV news.It is illogical in it's premise only by making his characters literally undefinable by any action they take no matter how atrocious!  Anyway, out of respect for Mr. Little please pick up "The Policy" instead, not only do you care how they resolve the issue, but you get a few cheap laughs as well 
 Don't buy this book.  It wasn't John Sears.  We know now that it was W. Mark Felt, the No. 2 man at the FBI who was the source. 
 I would like to think of myself as someone who is fairly well informed of the (short) history and theory of video art. As such, I will say this book is a very basic, sort of bland overview of the langauge of video. It's very well put together in terms of it being flashy and "hip"; all the stills are well printed and all the big, "in-vogue" art star names are included (but where are people like Haron Faroqi? Or did he just shoot on film and thus not make the hipster cut?) With that said, there is little to no actual critical content in the writing. It introduces concepts in a very simple way, and doesn't actually end up saying much other than varying degrees of further artist canonization. I don't know maybe I am just too picky and also semi-brainwashed by more rigorous academic books on the topic, but I actually stopped reading the book because it was so boring. If you're looking for a slick coffee table book with which to impress your friends, one that will let them know that you too have joined that cool club called "connoisseurship of video art" and a book that they will tend to thumb through just to look at "all the pretty pictures" (which I find hilariously absurd- a book of still images taken from video), then this book is for you. If you're looking for anything deeper than that, I would look elsewhere to titles like "Illuminating Video : An Essential Guide to Video Art" by David Ross, Doug Hall, Sally Jo Fifer, and David Bolt. 
 This book is awful and should be avoided at all costs.  The plot is thin and has huge holes in it, I skimmed the last hundred pages just to get through it.  Nothing annoys me more than when a female writer gives her female characters every negative female stereotype there is.  Truth is supposed to be highly educated and working in the paranormal field but knows ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about it...she misses such obvious things that it is amazing she can tie her own shoelaces without help. If this is a real exampe of occultists in the modern day they deserve all the bad press they get as none of these people has any intelligence of their own and blindly follow whatever "cult" leader is convenient 
 If you are looking for a book, where you can read and enjoy the stories... this is not for you. The way it is written, is so difficult to understand and there is no continuos flow in the book, which will make you so bored that you just want to stop reading. 
 This is a rather peculiar film for Seagal, and the first thing that should be pointed out to any Seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film.  Seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief.  In fact, they are extraordinarily brief, though thankfully free of wirefu.    Though Out of Reach is by no means a total failure (it's actually pretty entertaining, Seagal as always is fun to watch, and some of the scenes are well done), the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes.  This film is a drama about a nature nut (Seagal) who roams the forest looking for injured animals.  He has a pen pal in Poland, a young girl, and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her, even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her.  This brings up the main problem with this film, namely, a lot of it simply doesn't make any sense.  It turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring, and Seagal goes through the motions to save her.  As per usual with Seagal nowadays, he obviously refused to actually finish the production, and so we have the usual dubbing problem here.  It is even more salient than usual in this picture, however, for here we have not one, but several different people dubbing Seagal's voice, none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him!  Here the most frequently heard fill-in for Seagal sounds like a knock-off Benecio Del Toro with a much higher-pitched voice.  As you can imagine, the effect is very humorous.    As stated above, the main problem with this movie is that it simply doesn't make sense, which was apparently realized by the director, as he has, in many scenes, the voice fill-in for Seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking! How obnoxious!   Seagal's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal, which she later uses to communicate with Seagal.  What makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for Seagal, the villian, ineptly played by Matt Schultz, sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for Seagal to find! In one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code.  (Apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means "This is a trap.")  The villain sees her doing this, and, instead of destroying the message (which would make sense), later has it delivered to Seagal! Huh? In a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling Seagal where she is, the villian sees her doing it, comments on how clever she is, but then leaves the message!   There are also quite of few mistakes in this film, several of which are laughably obvious.  At the beginning and end of this film, for example, Seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy, black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head.  During the rest of the film, however, he has short hair.  At the end, after some BS macho dialogue about how Seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing Schultz slowly, each character uncocks his pistol even though Schultz's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock, and even though in the very next closeup Seagal's pistol is still cocked! After a sword fight, which ends on a classic move from older chambara films, notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor, and that then, all-of-a-sudden, there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters.    In the finale, the above-mentioned sword fight, the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than Seagal.  This brings up another frequent complaint of many Seagal fans: his overuse of stunt doubles.  It's almost so bad now that one could say that he doesn't even film his own fight scenes now.  Have you ever noticed that in Lord Steven's early films, when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves? Now what happens? The camera gets as close as possible, shows some shots of his face grunting, shows some arms playing paddycake, then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing Seagal's face.  Ever wonder why? It's because, surprise, surprise, that's not Seagal doing the fighting.    In the gun fight, which is actually a very decent action scene, watch Seagal as he enters the room.  His character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll, which is probably the simplest move in aikido, though it is obvious that it is not Seagal doing the roll.  What is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film, which shows Seagal's character "roaming the forest looking for injured animals," or whatever, it is clearly not Seagal that we see walking through the forest.  Was he afraid that he'd trip over a branch and injure himself? Was he afraid he'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods? I don't know.  What is likely the case is that Seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact, using another actor, in order to make the film work.  I'm really not bashing Seagal, I'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could VERY easily be fixed.    Be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when Seagal goes to the post office.  The postal worker calls Seagal "Mr. Delacraw," or some such bizarre name, even though his character's name is actually Billy Ray Lancing.  Seagal then proceeds to mumble some French to the man, and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent.  This scene is downright strange.  What is also strange is how Seagal is dressed in this scene--like some kind of New Orleans Anne Rice fan, vampire wannabe in a strange, black fur coat.  I don't know, at least it's good for a laugh.   If Seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable.  The only truly schocking thing is that this hasn't happened yet.  He shows up late to shoots, leaves early, refuses to finish productions, and yet people keep hiring the man.  He repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production.  He needs to start finishing his films.  In closing, Out of Reach only has two VERY brief fight scenes, but they are somewhat well done.  Seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight, which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human.  
 This book, up to the very end was very good. With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half.  The end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud!  This story is not really horror, its SiFi. A adventure/drama/SiFi. It really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. Everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed. And somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. The writting was dead on as always and character development was good.  This book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book 
 This book provides a great overview of all the different ways a DJ can position him/herself in the marketplace. Of course, they leave out the newest opportunities like retail stores, cafes, and restaurants and instead concetrate a lot on being a mobile DJ for parties and weddings. You're way better off getting a book that specializes in one type of DJing and spending your time and money pursuing that 
 My husband and I are transitioning to raw foods.  We have read numerous books and were prompted to buy The Raw Gourmet because of the cover and the incredible photos inside.  Truly, the pictures are stunning.  Unfortunately, the recipes lack that certain something.  We made a few, but there were no instructions on exactly how to get the results she got in her pics.  In some recipes, the photo didn't even show the same ingredients she lists in the recipe!  I returned the book to the health food store after one week.  There are better raw food books out there.  See my review on Rainbow Green.. 
 THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring Frank Sinatra. This film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone.   This is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies. Afraid to assert a viewpoint, the script meanders. Denzel Washington plays the Sinatra role of Ben Markoe. He seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines.  Washington, normally a gifted actor, plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role.  Markoe discovers that his Gulf War comrade-in-arms, Raymond Shaw, soon to be the next Vice-President of the United States, has been the subject of mind control experimentation by Manchurian Global, a vast multinational conglomerate. Raymond's handler is his Senator mother (Meryl Streep in the role of an ice queen).   By diluting the threat from Communism to Capitalism, the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story. After all, it is no great achievement to convince a major American political candidate to back big business, and so the grotesqueries of Shaw's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop, seeming less heinous than merely greedy, even when Shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious, amoral, and possibly incestuous mother.  Why the film created the unlikely Manchurian Global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the Manchurian Global mindset that has gripped Hollywood. God forbid we should point a finger at mainland China (or anyplace else); it might reduce the bottom line. This film says more about its creators than about the threat it attempts to portray.  Do yourself a huge favor and stick with the original.  
 The Democrat Party has for years been considered by many average voters as less tolerant for people of faith.   It didn't used to be that way. During the Cold War, Kennedy and Johnson and the rest of the Democrats stood up to the atheists running the USSR and never apologized for doing so.  Things have changed, and to the Democrats' loss.  It is not George Bush going apoplectic when someone says "Merry Christmas" instead of "Happy Holidays." How many Republicans are trying to root out school prayer and ban the Pledge of Allegiance? Who is it that looks down on people who go to church and support the Ten Commandments?   It sure isn't Bob Dole or Dick Cheney.  The reality that Bill Press needs to address is what can the Democrats do to make themselves credible in religious-based issues. Senator Joseph Lieberman should be his model of choice, for it was Lieberman who stood alone when he publicly denounced President Clinton over his affair and subsequent lying regarding Monica Lewinsky. Religious values and morality were written all over his speech. And no Democrat dared to condemn him for it 
 In all honesty, I found this book contrived and irritating in the extreme. It talks down to the readers, and the only time I have seen language as overtly flowery was when I picked up a Danielle Steel. The author has no identity of his own, and is instead trying to accomplish something that freely borrows from Marion Zimmer Bradley and J.R.R. Tolkein. If you're looking for something that reaches out to an audience above the age of thirteen, give this one a pass 
 Never recueved the product.  Waiting for refund for over 6 weeks 
 Was expecting a book that really helps fairly new readers to the concepts of financial engineering. This book is not well written and throws the reader into a lot of topics without any real-world, practical examples. A much, much, much, better book is Investment Science by Luenberger. Get that book. It kicks Hull's ass 
 (disclaimer: I am NOT big, I am actually quite trim but I'd like to keep it that way and therefore I use home workout tapes in between gym sessions.)  After you get through a solid 12 minutes of spam, clips, and advertising, you are finally presented with a sloppily thrown together, uncoordinated poor excuse for Pilates. Beginners (which I am not) would be lost altogether as the instructor doesn't demonstrate her steps. The mat work is marginally better but not enough for me to ever touch it again. Therefore, this tape and the other ones I also bought from this series in the same purchase, are going in the "Goodwill" bag.   
 Well, as cute as this doll is... is it really pratical to have a baby with hair? So what if it's a toy, can't the company make it a little more realistic? I'm also going to address the skimpy little clothes they put on the dolls. Why can't they just wear diapers or long frilly dresses like normal babies?            Overall I think this whole Bratz baby thing is quite strange. I'm a big fan of the regular bratz, but I give the bratz babies 2 thumbs down. When I got this as a birthday present I rushed right back to the store and returned it 
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 The only thing you can say about today's music is that it's disguisting, gross, and made by recording artists who drop out of school and seem to think that a life as a rap music artists is so cool, until they get shot.  Every copy of this CD should be burned 
 I wavered awhile between three stars and two stars, because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as Sony and Akio Morita seem to deserve at least three. However, in the end, the book's errors just piled too high. It opens well, with the story of Sony's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half-wrecked department store just after World War II, to becoming one of the world's great companies. This is a fascinating and inspiring story, and Morita tells it with flair.  Then, unfortunately, the downward spiral begins. Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every other Japanese company operates the same way, which is a fantastically wrong assertion (as the last thirteen years of Japan's seemingly endless recession have shown). He also frequently takes good basic management techniques, like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway, and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely "Japanese".  Then there are all the claims which are simply out-and-out false, such as Japan supposedly having the world's best construction technology. (It actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world, as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated.)  Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything. (Yet it only recently discovered the concept of "second-hand goods", instead of throwing nearly-new furniture and clothing away. Plus, Japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world's worst overpackaging.)  Reading between the lines, a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that Japan faces today. For example, Morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States. While this can, of course, sometimes be a serious problem, it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves. Japan's consumers, on the other hand, without an accessible court system, are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives. Complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored, because they lack any threat of legal action. In another example, Morita praises the "trust" and agreements without contracts that exist among Japanese corporations. In reality, this "trust" is a death pact, as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies, instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs.  Other than the glimpses into Sony's history and corporate culture, this book is only interesting as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of "Japan is going to take over" books that came out in the Eighties. Although, of course, considering all the "Internet companies are going to take over" books that came out in the Nineties, not even this is a uniquely "Japanese" phenomenon.   PS: Anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of Japan should read "Dogs and Demons" by Alex Kerr. 
 What happened??! I have really been enjoying the Sneaky Pie Brown series - up till now. Found this one to be extremely disappointing and far off the mark for all the characters- they weren't very likeable. Conversations were too preachy and had little or nothing to do with the basic story line. There was very little focus leading up to how the mystery was solved, and  the condition in which the murder victim(s) were found, more graphic than it needed to be.  Ms Brown needs to go back and review her earlier books in this series and refresh her memory on why this series has been so fun to read. Jud 
 This book lacks technical details. This book talks too much about planning and management.  I would rather have a book with more step by step instructions on how to accomplish different tasks. This book talks more what Exchange can do and less on how to do it 
 I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.   Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books. 
 For much less than the price of this lexicon, one can purchase a copy of Thayer's, AND Trenchard's vocabulary guide AND a Greek concordance.  Academic snobs make a big deal about how Thayer's lexicon is out of date because he did not have access to the papyri, but for 99% of New Testament words and meanings this is not an issue.  Trenchard's book is actually MORE helpful, in my opinion, than this or any lexicon because he simply lists every possible meaning of each word.  One way to get to the essence of a word's meaning is to look at the cognates, and Trenchard lists them all.  A Greek concordance will actually print all the NT uses of a word in Greek.  Bauer's lexicon is just not that helpful and is too wordy.   
 This book was an attempt at writing a persuasive paper designed to minimalize the works of Pythagoras and his followers in order to lift up Parmenides onto a pedestal.  The author treats the Pythagoreans as having flawed ideas so that he can then claim that Parmenides came and had the correct or proper way of defining philosophy.  Reasons behind this could stem from the fact that both Pythagoras and Parmenides lived during the same time period, and he needed to degrade Pythagoras in order to show that Parmenides made the greatest contribution to the start of philosophy as being the "better" pre-Socratic thinker.  The funny truth of the matter is that Pythagoras is probably more widely known for his and his group's accomplishments than Parmenides, and it is a shame the author felt as though he had to exclude a brilliant philosopher in order to champion another.  I have considered myself to be a practical philosopher, a person who can take ideas and test them towards real world goals.  This way of operating makes philosophy a tool one can use to navigate through life's unpredictable outcomes.  Pythagoras had a series of precepts that he taught his students and his followers continued this regimen in order to not just think, but to do.  The author is scared to admit this, to recognize this philosophy, because then it would jeopardize the perceived achievements of his idol Paremides.  One of the limitations I see with current academic philosophy is that it is stuck within the very mindset that the author has, which is that philosophy is just about thinking for the sake of thought and thought alone.  Other academic professors share his view.  This is a very narrow view, and it does not help the field of philosophy to hold such a view.  Philosophy is a large umbrella full of ideas which have sprouted just about all the major fields of study taught in universities today.  Philosophy needs to find the connections it made long ago and claim credit for the broad body of knowledge that has been a neccesary part of the functionality of societies both past, present, and into the forseeable future.  Trying to create a niche in philosophy in order to make it stand out will just turn away those students and practitioners who know that there are a panorama of philosophies both practiced and taught and that it is this trait which makes philosophy so special 
 Eeyucch. Sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a Vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background. Oh look, isn't that Wayne Newton over there 
 The world's biggest bear has nothing new to say. You'd be better off with books from someone who practices what they preach. If you pay for cable or a dish to get CNBC, you're already losing money. Don't waste any more 
 As I waded through page after page after page, I began to think of a group of Hollywood scriptwriters sitting around a table.  Each is trying to top the other by dreaming up more outlandish and depressing situations for his/her characters.    "A Fine Balance" is totally depressing, one tragedy after another all the way to the last page (601).  By the end of the book, I was convinced I was reading the screenwriters' list crammed into a novel. 
 This book is a pathetic attempt to copy Edith Wharton's beautiful novel "Ethan Frome." It does not have the power of Wharton's classic and does not hold the reader's interest. I thought that this book just  rambled on without a purpose until its conclusion. It should have never  been given the Pulitzer Prize 
 I thought this video would have been of some "outstanding better way of loving making".   Instead, in my opinion, it is mostly a teasing lesson for the female partner, and also for the male partner which he practically uses his fingers during the "whole" time on this video(one focused).   This lesson is not better sex, it's simply another approach to sex which doesn't match up to the title of the video, sorry 
 I was disappointed like many of the previous readers, mostly having to do with non-existent character development (all clones of each other), insipid dialogue and no real suspense because the mission was done by superhumans (all of whom seemed to be "ruggedly handsome"). However, I was also irked by some of the technical inconsistencies. For example, if one can actually believe that non-musicians can air-guitar their way through a live performance, it doesn't explain how the drummer managed to fool everyone. Also, I find it hard to believe that their GPS was working in the depths of the sewers. Also, the cops' plan to pour dye into the sewers didn't seem like it should have worried the corporation; with a couple of hours head start, wouldn't their raft pop out into the harbour long before the dye? Also, the CIA head was 33 years old in 1959, and supposedly was some kind of intelligence officer in WWII; pretty responsible job for someone who was 19-years old at the end of the war 
 I'm not the biggest fan of Springsteen, but I have liked a lot of what he's done in the past. I wasted my money on this one. It sounds like uninspired mumbling. Not much musical or vocal variation at all among the songs. Nothing stands out. No experimentation. There might be some good story lines in the songs, but I usually can't understand him anyway. I liked two songs, but not enough to get the album out and turn it on. I never desire to play it after a few listenings. So beware, unless your a huge fan and want all his music, this one may let you down. 
 I was so angry that I wasted time reading this spectacularly boring book that I had to warn others.  The storyline is repetitious as is the diction...I have to agree with the author of review that asked if DS even has an editor anymore.  Sheesh... 
 When I bought this cd, no where at all on the case did it say that it was partly a live album. I was very upset after I quickly went to my favorite song, and found a mess of a live version in its place. I am not a fan of live albums, and would NEVER have bought this if I had known. They are not even good attempts at the songs that I grew up loving. All he managed to do is yell a lot, sing off key, and play to the crowd. My favorite Neil Diamond songs were destroyed, but on a HAPPY note, at least the WHOLE album wasn't live. 
 You could sum up this book in a few words. "Women are stressed out and seek products or services that ease their stressed out lives. Women play many diffrent roles: the mother, sister, good wife, working woman, friend. Women are diffrent from men." However, this could be a good business/marketing book but it is not. First of all, the author feels a need to always mention her company's name and feels a need to prove herself all the time by saying "that she has been a ceo" etc (talk about low selfesteem). Secondly, this is not a book about the global woman, the average english or swedish woman, it is about the all american "ricky lake" woman that really doesnt know a thing about other countries or cultures. If you are marketing to this particular segment, the all american middle class woman then this book might come in handy. Beware, this book is not about the average female consumer. And the some 220pages could easily have fitted in to 20 pages. The author has just expanded a few points with alot of TALK. This book does not deserve more than 2 stars and this is from a guy that has some 300-400 business books on his bookshelf. 
 I found it amazing that Fay Vincent tries to pass this off as a new idea.  Donald Honig already did this, and did it better.  Apparently, what the players said was transcribed verbatim, which made it difficult to read.  Additionally, most serious baseball fans have heard this all before.  Bobby Doerr and Johnny Pesky's stories were covered in detail in David Halberstam's The Teamates.  This is supposed to be the first of a series of books like this.  If so, this was the last one I purchased 
 Usually, when I purchase music, I'll tape off my favorite 4 or 5 cuts and forget about the rest of the songs. Not so on this album...there's not a cull in the bunch. The musicians in this band are such that even if you don't like bluegrass, after listening to these boys pick, you will at the very least have to admire their musicianship. I happen to play myself, and I'm pretty much a traditionalist, but there's enough of hard-drivin', down-home 'grass on this one to please anyone. If you're thinking of buying this one, in my opinion, you can't go wrong. Try it...you'll like it 
 I found this to be very dated in techniques and style. I knew it was ten years old, but I didn't realize the vast changes in stenciling.  I didn't find the instruction to be particularly detailed, and learned far more from the many other books available 
 I can't believe I bought this, one of the worst purchases I've ever made.  Far from being a step-by-step how to actually set up a web site, it's filled with "if you want to do this, then do this, or if you want to do that, then do that."  Perhaps I'm more comfortable with programming books that actually step you through a series of ever-increasingly-complex projects in order to teach you how to use the languange.  This book reads more like a reference book for those who already know FrontPage, or a page-by-page description of what the controls will do rather than why I would want to use the control in the first place.  IMO, it's hardly a beginner's book, and not worth the deeply discounted price it's selling for 
 Gets a star for pointing out that writing is scary, but has nothing to offer in terms of advice beyond "do it anyway, risk-taking is good."  So now we need a writer oriented book on risk-taking, I guess 
 This cookbook is okay if you love to cook.  Many of the recipes have a lot of ingredients and take time to prepare.  If you don't like to cook or  you like to cook simple meals, this would not be the cookbook for you 
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
 This piece of trash was completely unwatchable.  I can't believe Matthew and Renée read this script and said yeah lets do it. Absolutely dreadful 
 The formula for any Will Smith movie is to have him say "Damn" every six line of his dialogue and give him really cute humor, no matter what the situation is.  This movie was totally unbelievable, honestly.  For instance, Big Willie Style running around Metro D.C. in the winter wearing only boxer shorts.  Not to mention countless errors both in editing and directing.  On to the plot, the entire American government is evil (it can happen), mind you are villains are Jon Voight, who I can swallow as a villain, but Jamie Kennedy, Jack Black, Barry Pepper, Jake Busey and Seth Green?!  Is this an action movie or a poor man's Kids in the Hall?  Gene Hackman is always good, but I don't even think Lex Luthor can help the Fresh Prince in this over price bucket of trash.     Hey we should all just get Jiggy with it!!  
 I could really not tell any difference in my teeth after using this product. I could, however, see how my gums were burned by the peroxide 
 I like to find movies in which current "stars" were not yet household names.  I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in such recent films as 'Underworld' and 'Van Helsing' and this plot line of one of her earlier films, sounded humorously entertaining.    Kate plays an orphan, Flora Poste, who goes to live with your long lost cousins at Cold Comfort Farm.  Flora likes organization and finds very interesting ways of making her cousins see their true paths in life (often leaving the farm to do so), while simplifying and keeping her life organized.  She's a very charming control freak.  The film has a true, understated British humor and charm with many great one-liners, but I can't say that I found the film to be "hysterically" funny, nor worth the repeat view.  I strongly suggest Greenfingers (Clive Owens) and Saving Grace (Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn) as alternatives in the category of "not yet a household name". 
 Leans towards the blues side.Heartfelt vocals.Lacking licking licks.Less driving than their debut 
 This book is very boring. It is more like reading philosophy than a novel 
 This book is not about what the title implies. The part of the title, "Why Evangelicals Don't Think", implies that the book will address why evangelicals are so against science and Biblical criticism (both of which bring a fuller understanding of how God and Jesus work and think). It is not an attempt to reconcile science and Christianity.  This book is actually a critique of evangelicals by an evangelical for being too caught up in popular culture to the point where they either don't practice their faith or become ignorant of their own faith and holy books.    The author follows the history of how evangelicals became absorbed in popular culture and pleads for evangelicals to return to the roots of evangelical Christianity and studying the Bible.   I am giving it 2 stars because of the misleading title. I didn't give it 1 star because studying the roots of Christianity and the Bible is one way to address "Why Evangelicals Don't Think." 
 In many ways this book is just as interesting as previous books in the series. Adams humor is in tact and will have you snickering fairly often.  The main problem is that of the overall plot. It is unsatisfying and pessamistic. Not just the ending. Tricia Mcmillian or Trillan turns from being a likable and symathetic character to somone who uses people and makes them clean up her mess. It is a heartbeakingly unfit end to a series I have such fondness for. This is compounded by the fact that the late Douglas Adams wished to write a sixth book after this one but never got around to it.   At this point it is better to consider the fourth book the final guide since it has such a satisfyingly beautiful end. For those who love the works of Adams should read it anyway, since it is well... a douglas adams book. Just dont be to dissapointed when you are dissapointed 
 I was assigned to read and use this book for a Methods class at CMU. Jackson did a good job of selling the concept of problem frames to me. They seem like a good way to model a system, properly abstracting the problem into distinct interacting segments. It produces diagrams which are helpful as a general architectural overview and are generally largely understandable by non-technical customers. The concept has potential.  Unfortunately, the book does not live up to the concept. The main flaw in the book is found the first time that you need to look up a concept in a prior chapter. Jackson tends to mention a given concept, or a given definition, only once in the book and he uses no way of setting off the concepts and definitions from the rest of the text on the page. Further exacerbating the problem, he makes the cardinal error of software engineers, using common words as his terminology, and redefining them for his purposes. Not only does this mean that his terms don't stand out from the text, but this also means that the reader will be forced to puzzle out whether Jackson is referring to "machine" as a term within his framework, or simply referring to the dictionary definition of a machine.  It's not all bad. Jackson does have a friendly conversational style to his writing that turned me on to the concept while reading the chapters the first time. Unfortunately, the reread entirely turned me off 
 I am a huge Thrice fan, and I love every album that they have done up to this point.  If you like any of Trice's earlier albums this album will surely put you to sleep.  It is a total change from punk/hardcore to a mellow, easy listening, pseudo Cold Play music. The radio friendly We Are the Invisible is the only half way decent track on the album, but you'll be sick of it after you listen to it twice.  This album is boring, lyrically weak, and bears no resemblance to anything Thrice has ever done. If you like anything you've ever heard by Thrice buy any other album but this one 
 I am disappointed and I haven't even read it yet.  If anything Steve has written and quoted out of the book is correct then it is just another case of the blind leading the blind.  Please read his review and decide for yourself.  I still plan to buy the book but as with everything else I will take it with a huge chunk of salt.  Sounds to me like the so called "Conservatives" have just put out another book to "unbiasedly" support their positions and make it easier to swallow by the masses.  There is no such thing as a conservative any more.  If you want to get back to constitutional government, go check out the Libertarian party and view their positions.  They come the closest to truly supporting a government of the people, by the people and for the people.  The rest of them are still just self serving and don't want to let go of their power and your money.  Dan  
 I was very disappointed when I received this book and found it to be a comic book!  I have really enjoyed the other CSI books so this was just a let down right off the bat 
 As much as I loved the features and music from Bruces' 30th anniv. Born to Run package, I disliked Devils & Dust. I am about 2 weeks older than Mr.Springsteen and have most of his music, seen him preform 6 times. the last in early 2002. I enjoyed the acoustic parts of the concert and the RIsing cd very much. But this one excapes me and doesn't touch what I love about his lyricism, use of instrumentation, and ability to put simple concepts into complex settings, or complex feelings into simple yet elegant lyrics...on Devils he puts highly personal and obscure messages into obscure settings. I wish for more poetry as found on his first three albums and tunnel of love. I hope others will find these songs more personal to them, I just can't find my way into them, didn't like Nebraska or Tom  Joad either. sorry, Bruce... seado 
 Systemic Mechanic 6 seemed to be helping, since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well.   However, the "repair broken shortcuts" function does not work properly.    For a variety of reasons I use a large number of Microsoft Word Shortcuts in my Folder/ File  system.   System Mechanic "repaired broken shortcuts" on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target.   Now I am pulling up documents which are similar ( but are actually older versions which I have save to an auxiliary hard drive ) or unrelated to the actual, correct target file. This has had severe productivity consequences,  since I have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut.  Contacting on-line Help was of no help whatsoever.   
 The songs just did not get me dancing.  I have to say I was disappointed.  But I love Kids Favorite Songs VOl 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl 
 Strange that this person is listed as a woman who changed modern America.  Isn't this supposed to be a book about positive change?  Gretchen Buchenholz's efforts to save border babies somehow seems more a vanity attempt, promoting herself, inviting her friends (the political, the rich and famous), and photo ops.  Ms. Buchenolz always seems to have her name in the front of advertisements about her programs.  What a beautiful facade....promoted for the benefit of babies.  But if her purpose is to help babies, it doesn't seem that her track record is that good.  In fact, it is shameful. Ask about Tanae Green and Stephanie Ramos, babies in the foster care agency run by Ms. Buchenholz....  Both babies died of horrible neglect, and Ms. Buchenholz didn't show her face to protect, protest, or speak up for them, even at the end of their lives. She was strangely silent, and used her connections to prevent bad publicity.  
 As the reviewer from Jackhorn, KY stated, this book lacks original research.  If you read the section on the "house church movement" and then go to the website for The Homechurch Homepage, you will see that Mr. Wolfe hacked away at many of the articles on the site to obtain his "research."  For the many quotes he used from the website, not once were any of the authors contacted by Mr. Wolfe in order to do any original research.  If he had done so, he would have come away with a different take than he wrote in his book 
 I've had this phone for nearly a year now, it has been hardly used, 3 hours per week the most and the battery died on both units.  I will have to replace the batteries since it is not usable at all 
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage 
 My 3 year old received this toy for Christmas.  She enjoys putting the puzzles together very much.  However, she has trouble getting them apart - the wooden pieces do not come apart very easily.  We already have 4 or 5 pieces that have broken - a layer of the wood has come off, either off the picture part or the back of the piece.  I was disappointed when a piece broke after we only had the puzzles a few days!  The wood is very thin.  The shapes on the back are great for sorting the pieces, but the compartments that hold the pieces aren't big enough.  If the pieces don't go in "just so" - the lid won't close.  The puzzles are nice, but I would not purchase this toy again due to the quality 
 and this book sends the message that it is.  Borrowers don't "borrow" things; they steal them.  This book teaches kids that, as long as you don't get caught, taking things that don't belong to you is a-okay.  Being "seen" is, after all, the only thing that Borrowers worry about 
 One of the many problems with this book is the order in which the topics are presented.  Right off the bat, They decide to put linear equations ahead of all other types of DE's.  Are they really as simple to solve as seperable equations?  The entire second chapter is a complete mess and is very disorganized.  The forumla for the integrating factor of linear equations is difficult to ascertain, and it is never clearly stated (it's there, but their notation is convoluted).  I don't want to sound like someone who is just having difficulty with the math taking it out on the innocent textbook.    I have consulted other textbooks on the topic, and I have to say that I really like Zill's DE's for the logical way in which it is organized, and    Kohler and Johnson's text for its clear explanations.  My professor actually commented on how bad this book is.  All DE textbooks are NOT created equally, and if you are struggling through this one, try finding older editions of those other two from your University's library.    
 I have all of the 4 major sports books of the Total package.These stats were increddibally incomplete like they show no tackles stats. I know tackles are not an official stat but there are sources like with the Negro leagues in baseball that show the stats. I liked the part about the Top 300 players to 1998. The Draft had all of the picks but I wish they would have who the top players were in each draft like the hockey one. I thought this book was okay it had some good stats but is no where near Hockey-Baseball-Basketball versions 
 I spent 3 days trying to get this installed.  I think the complication was that I had Norton Systemworks 2005 and wanted to add the NAV 2006 on top of it.  Well I finally got it done, but not until I'd restored my system to a backup from before I'd installed NSW 2005.  At that point I had NSW 2003 installed.  I had to manually uninstall that and remove tons of entries from the registry.  Norton's automated uninstall failed over and over so I gave up on that and did it by hand.  Then I installed NSW 2005 with NAV.  When I went to install NAV 2006 it was unable to uninstall the old version.  So I had to restore the system again.  This time I installed NSW 2005 without NAV.  I was then able to install NAV 2006.  It is working now.  It just shouldn't be this difficult 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 		Asking an alleged humourist to explain economics is similar, with all due apologies to Mark Twain, to asking a dog to dance on its hind legs;  it can be done, but it serves no useful purpose and merely annoys the dog.  	Granted, economics can be funny.  Stephen Leacock was an economist of the last century who wrote the classic 'Sunshine Sketches of a Small Town'.  In contrast to O'Rourke's nattering negative nonsense, Leacock's humour was "the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life and the artistic expression thereof."  There's no danger of O'Rourke's bitter bile becoming a classic or being remembered for its humour.  	"Humour" and "kindly" do go together.  If O'Rourke ever read Leacock, he didn't learn much.  This book is a 1950s-rant against the evils of socialism, completely ignoring that one of the most successful socialist societies was the Jesuit missions among the Guarani of Paraguay.  This decent, humane and prosperous society was crushed by free enterprise slavers who wanted quick profits by making slaves of the Guarani rather than teaching them harmony in hymns.  Likewise, the ongoing success of the Salt River Project in Arizona, according to one of its directors a few years ago, "is proof that socialism works."  	Socialism can work, but it requires people with the qualities of saints.  The difference between O'Rourke's rant and the reality of earthly socialism was aptly seen by Leacock, who explained "socialism won't work except in Heaven, where they don't need it, or in Hell, where they already have it."  In other words. O'Rourke needs to learn it's not funny to beat a dead horse.  	Smith wrote an eloquent explanation of what happens when people are allowed to follow their own interests.  This is the most basic right of all people, it is the essence of democracy.  O'Rourke doesn't seem to understand this;  instead, he thinks, "an examination of any democractically elected government leads to deep puzzlement about why democracy works."  	Oh?  My humble observation is that American democracy is an inspiration for the world.  In other words, it works.  Try and find a better system.          In O'Rourke's view, justice is merely a "cash register" to provide government revenues.  In Smith's view, "every man, as long as he does not violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free . . . . ."  Smith justifies interference with the freedom of individuals when it is necessary to protect consumers;  O'Rourke seems to think of it as merely another form of tax.  Maybe he should drive with greater consideration for others, to cut down on his traffic tickets.  	In brief, O'Rourke doesn't understand Smith, the modern world or the incongruity of humour.  Or perhaps, in his defence and in terms of those who hate every success of America, O'Rourke understands everything all too well and wants to return to the perfect freedom of Rousseau's savages.  	Conspiracy theorists believe tragedy is the product of a diabolical axis-of-evil plot.  In contrast, O'Rourke is an omni-theorist who thinks everything is a conspiracy.  Perhaps his next book will explain how the Vatican, al Qaeda and Mickey Mouse are partners in a vast multi-wing conspiracy to inundate him with traffic tickets, or perhaps to make buttered toast land butter-side down when it falls from the table.  	With it, he might tap a source of humour.  Until then, he should think about why petty-minded zealots are never funny.   
 I guess there's a reason why we're supposed to care about Horowitz's journey from Maoist to right-wing hack, but I didn't discover it in this tiresome book. If people are interested in some reminiscing of sixties radicalism, and the issues people who battle the establishment (not serve it) face, I'd recommend the DVD, "The Weather Underground. 
 The statements in the book reads as a SUN document. So if you dont want to take the trouble to sit in front of a computer and search through all the links for certification objectives in SUN website, you can purchase this book. 
 Terrible, all around bad movie. Don't waste your time 
 Native Tongue  by Carl Hiaasen   This book is fast paced, has a lot of energy, and a zany weirdness.  No doubt, it is a page-turner.  And it is better than the other book of Hiaasen's I have read, Double Whammy.  But all that does not a good read make...  A strength of Hiaasen's books are his characters, well defined and numerous.  Most are straightforward stereotypes, from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist, the vapid sex-phone girlfriend, a steroid-doped strongman, the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy, a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop, to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars, and loads of redneck Florida "crackers".  Hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops, and by casting two characters that are quite original, an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman, and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman.  And we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins.  Etc. etc.  So what's wrong.  Mainly, it's that the book stays at a level of TV-sitcom-gone-book.  It achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject.  One might think that the exception is the environment, but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here.  So perhaps Native Tongue is just pure entertainment?  If you like brainless action, gratuitous violence, gross humor, and zany "fun", Native Tongue might satisfy.    I have one additional problem with Hiassen, and it's similar to the problem I so often have with Michael Crichton.  These books stink of hypocrisy.  Crichton makes a (seriously good) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science.  Hiassen's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society, but Hiaasen's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness.   While I enjoyed a few sections of Native Tongue, I had no doubts at the end that I had wasted many hours that should have been better spent 
 This is an unbelievably bad book. The story, including the identity of the villain, is obvious within the first chapters. The characters, dialogue and situations are so unbelivable as to be ridiculous. If the protagonists in this story graduated from medical school, I might consider sending my hamster, because they seem to have about an equal intelligence level. David and Angela should have figured this whole mess out even before I did, but they were too busy listening to their daughter's improbable dialogue, answering her with trite, cutesy nonsense, and putting her into situations that should have made them lose their parenting privileges. Cook should leave polemics about HMOs to the analysts and concentrate on basic writing techniques - plot, character development and dialogue 
 I bought this album after reading a rave review in Newsweek magazine.  I was thoroughly dissapointed.  Mr. Lynne goes from trying too hard to not trying enough at several points, and the lyrics are poorly executed and cliche ridden.  Ultimatley, I felt like I was listening to a demo tape 
 As a fan of N. Farmer after reading The House of The Scorpions, I had grasped this book with enthusiasm.  Sadly, I now question my admiration towards the author.  This book, set in early saxon era, gives overly descriptive and frank and straight forward counts of the Norse people's heinous actions, without consideration of the ages of her readers:  page 105 - "The sad eyed woman collapsed.  She hadn't been strong to begin with.  Olaf dragged her up, and with a swift movement that made Jack cry out, he cut her throat and threw her over the side."  And, that's just a tip of the iceberg.  Try a search on "cut" within this book and you will find dozens of more of these decadent actions that I truly do not believe that a young person should be reading.    	In regards the characters, I have to agree with other one-star givers, that there are no character buildings within the story.  I did not see any special ability nor courage in Jack, who was chosen to the bard's apprentice.  His sister, Lucy, is a retard - thinking the Norsemen who captured them are some king's men who came to take her back to be a princess.  Thorgil, who is one of the "shield maiden" is absurdly defiant - how she still survived the odyssey, is outrageous.  And, of course, Olaf - whose suicidal downfall was inevitable in a battle with an invincible opponent called a troll-bear.    	Only good part I see in this book is how the author tried to weave and bestows the knowledge of Norse mythology upon the readers.  The book is crammed with trolls, Asgard, Jotuns, Freya and etcetera.  It is filled with good knowledge.  Yet, the storytelling is very hectic.  Surroundings and atmospheres are left undescribed.  The novel bounds along with hiatus leaving to wonder as if this book should have been a trilogy where many sections seem detracted to fulfill the publisher's encumbrances rather than the author's artistry to shorten a potentially a greater novel to a mere kiddies' read.  	To fulfill the knowledge of Norse mythology, I would recommend "D'Aulaires' Book of Norse Myths"  
 I have to say I was very disappointed with this book when it arrived.  I bore with it for the first hundred pages although I felt that there was too much emphasis on why we use this type of teaching method and not enough information on how. I wanted ideas that I felt would work with my students and I found very few of these, some of the suggestions were just plain silly and would turn a literature discussion into a type of group therapy such as 'what memory does this poem remind you of'.  I don't know, maybe American students are different to Irish ones, but I know mine have a resistance to exposing the inner workings of their hearts and minds to fellow students who would possibly find it hilarious and I know that although reader response criticism is a good counterbalance to the way literature was taught in our day when the thoughts and feelings of the student didn't matter too much, has the pendulum swung too far in the other direction? Aren't we supposed to be discussing literary texts, not the psyches of our students.  Anyway, I felt that many of these suggestions just wouldn't work with many classes and that there was very little that I could actually apply or that would improve my teaching 
 I picked up this book based on the recommendations of several friends in order to use it as a source for a lecture on women's history for a historical methodology class, and I cannot begin to describe how disappointed I was upon reading it.  The title of the book is a provocative question, one that asks us to explore the limits of what we know about history, and, indeed, a question that I would love to have answered.  However, while Miles produced a fireworks-filled book, it fell far short of constructively contributing to the understanding of history.  There are nuggets of good information, information that is worthy of reflection; however, they are few and far between.  Much of the rest of the information cited by Miles is extremely biased or simply misinterpreted, and there is very little treatment of anything that does not fit squarely within her view of history. Yes, it is true that Miles acknowledges in her introduction that she is biased, but this is not an excuse to write history books of dubious quality.  After all, aren't all historians biased in some way?  Recapturing the role of women throughout the history of the world is essential for a fuller understanding of the past.  There are more than enough other authors that accomplish this much more successfully than Miles (Joan Wallach Scott is an excellent example) that it is simply not worth either your time or money to read this book 
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 When I read the review of this book in the New York Times Book Review, reprinted in the Chicago Law Bulletin (I am an attorney), I ran to several bookstores to find it. Almost at once I was disappointed at the sophomoric analysis and use of sources such as Newsweek and the New York Times. David  Cole is pretty much dead on in the premise of each of his chapters, though  I agree with the other reader that he may place too much blame on the  Supreme Court. What is truely dissapointing is the shallowness and  one-sidedness of his arguments along with his use of unreliable sources of  information. The writing seems to me to be on the level of a college  student, not a Georgetown University law professor. Which is very  disappointing, because what he is saying needs to be said 
 This book is nothing but a shameful and disguised attempt (notwithstanding his denials) to discredit Democratic voters and to advocate the enactment of "election reform" laws that will disenfranchise voters, while at the same time ignore and dismiss the greatest threat to our democracy today - the privatization of our elections with corporate owned electronic voting machines that count our votes using secret software and leave no paper trail for auditing them.  To be more specific:  The book is filled with purported examples of illegal voters, ignoring the fact that this problem accounts for a small minority of election fraud in our country today.  To remedy this problem, Fund advocates several measures that will do little to remedy the problem, while disenfranchising millions of voters, mostly those who are poor or non-white and most likely to vote Democratic.  Here are just three examples, among the many cited in Funds book: 1) Disallowing homeless people to vote because they don't have a proper address; 2) Requiring a picture ID to vote - which 10% of the population lack, and which amounts to a poll tax for the poor; 3) Abolishing the extending of voting hours in situations where insufficient allocation of voting machines results in as long as 10 hour waits to vote (again, this is a problem faced mainly in poor and minority neighborhoods).     But whereas Fund is so concerned that an occasional illegal voter may slip through the cracks in our system, when it comes to electronic voting machines that count our votes using secret software, although admitting that mistakes are sometimes made, he claims that these machines cannot be used to steal elections.  To prove this point he does nothing more than quote a man who works as a PR consultant for Diebold - although Fund is Careful not to mention this fact.      
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
 Like Carpenter, Ballard suffers from poor execution of some good ideas. John Carpenter may or may not have been a good director once (depending on your point of view), but for the past 20 years he has consistently put out movies where the premise looks engaging on paper (Prince of Darkness, They Live, etc.), but quickly fall into a semi-coherent mess. Likewise Ballard, who is at best coasting on the reputation of a 30 year old book. Ballard has had some great visionary ideas, but his sad insistence on overfocusing on sexual perversion as a compelling/repelling drive for his characters got tired a long, long time ago. If Tom Robbins was a humorless German surgeon instead of an aging hippie, you'd get a close approximation of Ballard's hang-ups. In Ballard's world, all forms of sexual expression are deviant, creepily desperate, and universally abundant. Ballard no longer seems like a literary provocateur, but more like a pedophilic, self-important older uncle that your family would rather not discuss. "Super-Cannes" is Ballard's rewrite of "Fight Club", with the rich and powerful assuming the roles of the disillusioned and powerless 
 My pump just up and quit after several years...and it didn't always work great, but when it did, it was ideal. So I'll replace it, but with some other product, not the Cuisipro again. 
 I found this book to be disappointing. The reason may simply be because The Killer Angels is such a hard act to follow. 
 Tony Morrison is an excellent writer. I simply anticipated more out of her before reading this book. Maybe it is my problem as a white male, but I expected more raw emotion from her characters or better insight on the people she wrote about, or, alas the plight of the African-American woman. Maybe that was the point of the book to show that all of these human emotions have been locked up due to terrible circumstance and treatment 
 I found this book to only be okay and boring it needs zaz not blaa..That is what it is blaa. I would pass it on or give it to a in-law then to keep it.It has good reciepes but no more then the other ones and it is a basic book. I think ,if this is to have a bang it needs more then what it has. 
 I found this book through a newspaper review and eagerly bought it. I was very disappointed. It is overly academic, dull, poorly organized and excessively wordy. As a journalist, I understand the powers of brevity and clarity, but the author does not. Even the organization, by month, leaves a lot to be desired as the author still skips between months. The political background becomes so laborious that it is impossible to follow a chain of events or personalities. I would definitely skip reading this book, even though I forced my way through all of it, hoping that it would get better. It did not 
 I was disappointed in this novel.  I was expecting science fiction and got fantasy.    Morrow seems to want to be Kurt Vonnegut.  His plot twists, unfortunately, don't measure up to those of Uncle Kurt.  The Lewis Carroll references were overdone.  I can't see this being recommended along side THE LAST SHIP, ON THE BEACH, and similar books.  If you are looking for apocalyptic fiction, look elsewhere.  
 Ok, so the song playing when Brian goes and we see mia for the first time is a song called "Deep Enough (Urban remix)" by Live.  I have the other songs written down, including the one played between the two buildings, so I will find them and tell you.  If you all want only the songs that were actually in the movie, rent the dvd, and take about ten minutes to watch the credits and write down the song names and artists.  That's how I have only the songs that are in the movie 
 Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length.  (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. Ick. Self-induldgent.  Boring.)  Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject's wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations.  I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming.  Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars.    John McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story 
 I'm not sure Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel.  I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point.  The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes.  But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'.  Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations.  I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers:  this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers.  It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then.  Yuck 
 I decided to give this book a chance, but wish I hadn't. The author has a hateful attitude toward animals that is simply offensive.  That, combined with his extreme cynicism, really prevented me from enjoying the book. Not recommended 
 See my review of his other waste of time for more detail.  I have met his guy and know that he is just a terrible trader.  Everyone made (and lost) in the late nineties into 2000.  The key to successful trading is having a set of methods that can work in any market, or at least keep your losses limited during tough times.  This book niether provides any insight into profitable strategies that work today or lessons on how to keep losses to a minimum (in fact I KNOW that his guys averages his losing trades...losers average losers, mark).  Avoid this waste of your time. Spend toime reading the educational resources on your own brokers website instead.  Its free 
 This author recommends eating raw meat, raw milk, and raw eggs for some of her 'miracle cures'. Raw meat and dairy can kill you (cooked meat and dairy can too, but that's another book!). Don't take my word for it, click on the book cover and look at the index- you will find 'egg yolk for arthritis' and 'milk, raw' and 'milk for weight loss, raw'.   [...]  Ph Miracle and Ph Miracle for Diabetes are pretty good books. But one thing to keep in mind is that you need to be Ph *balanced*. Don't take alkilinity too far. Just as there are negative effects from acidosis, there are also negative effects from alkalinosis, though it is much more difficult in western society to be over-alkaline than it is to be overly-acidic.   The Ph of your saliva and urine should be slightly acidic at 6.4. That is what is balanced for humans.   Read about acidity and alkilinity in the book "Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, and Food Supplements". This book is a wonderful reference for health and has never lied to me. After reading about those 2 topics in this book, you will be better able to tell the truth from a crock of raw meat in any Ph book. 
 Let's face it folks this is not a rock album that everyone believes it is. I will start by saying I didn't play the 30 second snippet for "All I Want To Do" because I knew it was already a lost cause, the rest were all just as bad. There are only 2 songs that may be a little bit o.k. and they are "Can't Cry Anymore", and "We Do What We Can". I just feel that this was a pop album all the way even though it has a rock edge don't be decieved. I don't know what she's like, or anything like that, but I do know she's beautiful, but while talented it's not the music I seek to listen to. 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 This version does not have voice prompts to tell you directions or some of the other features you might expect. Microsoft now provides voice messages in version 2006 and it is cheaper than this version ($59-79 depending upon timing). It is worth the price if you have a laptop. Pocket Streets is disappointing. By the way, it is illegal to have your laptop open in the front seat in some states so don't get a ticket (they allow a normal GPS but not a laptop serving as a GPS...go figure).  By the way, Microsoft does not give a discount to upgrade from version 2005 to 2006 so your only choice is to purchase a new product at full price 
 I was hoping the focus would be on planning an outdoor wedding. I am a very detail oriented person and thought this would give me all the details I've established and then the ones I wouldn't even think of, being I've not planned an elegant outdoor event. Unfortunately my own details far surpassed what is written in this book. Most of the advice mentioned in this book is common sense. I would have appreciated a bit more info on seating, on sand, deck, grass, a mountaintop...decor, and what will work where, and what to use in place of candles (being outside can be windy), Outdoor foods, maybe some budget ideas thrown in...a disappointment, sorr 
 I bought this toy for my son who LOVES bubbles.  I put it together and can not make it work.  I checked it several times and the solution will not go all the way up.  I gave it to my brother-in-law to check out and he could not make it work either.  I can say that the Gazillion bubble solution is the best I have ever used 
 This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up 
 Though the title sells the book as the sexiest thing in Latin women writers and readers yet, the reality is that they fall very short of meeting expectations. Being Latina myself and in the United States, and even if I do get to identify with some of the themes and stories in some of the essays.. please, what a yawn. We are all depicted as martyrs, huge success stories in comparison to our parents and generations before us, and/or unable to speak English without saying one Spanish word every three sentences. I want to think that we have much more of an edge, much more of a sense of humor, (much better writing skills!) and much more of a story to tell others. "Latinas dish on sex, sass, and cultural shifting"? That must be in the second book, because this one is nothing but a flat collection of high school essays. Nice attempt though 
 Works OK lights up the page a little, but not great Doesn't work well enought in the dark 
 The performances included are good, BUT one CAN NOT HEAR THE MUSIC that the performers are skating to.  The music is at a very low volume with some female talking very loudly over it telling that they just did a "triple something".  That amateur commentary was not necessary and is very distrubing.  The audio "engineer" (if you can call him that) and the producer of this video should go back to high school and enroll in freshman audio-visual 
 This book starts out with 120 pages of fluff C - mediocre at best and NOT why I bought the book.  Then it discusses briefly what microcontrollers are - seemed more like a bunch of scattered notes on the topic thrown together - again NOT why I bought the book.  Then it dives into Motorola chips and spends many pages talking about them - NOT why I bought this book.  Then the author uses really useless examples like sort routines (like that happens in microcontrollers a lot - better examples would have helped here) to illustrate whatever it was he was trying to illustrate.    Over all the book had the feel that the author tossed a bunch of lecture notes together, some poor cut and paste C examples in the beginning and then just simply got lost in his mission to show us how to program microcontrollers in C.  The reason I bought this book was to learn what I could and could not do with C.  I wanted to find out where C ended and assembly code "had" to take over.  I wanted good in-line programming techniques, addressing schemes, code techniques, the best ways to implement monitors, slick ways to manipulate registers.. This book was about Motorola chips and some strange examples of how to program them.  The book should NOT be called Programming Microcontrollers in C - maybe something like, Some Touchy Feely Intro To C and Motorola Chips With Sort Functions 
 Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER 
 I can't get into this book nor can I find what I'm looking for because it's not broke down well. "Make up Don't Break up" is WAY better and explains why people are "scared" 
 This book goes into the hearts and minds of the ancient Greeks led by Odysseus and Achilles, who are guided by their gods. The Trojan War is brewing for the Greeks and thoughts of slaughtering their enemy, The Trojans are very strong. Can the Trojans survive? Will they all live to tell the tale of the Trojan War or will they all be killed?  On both sides, it's life or death on their minds. Have you ever heard of the Trojan horse and the victory for Odysseus? This book includes the story of Odysseus and why his son set out to find his father. The journey of the ancient Greeks to the Trojan homeland is included. Will they return or will they lie in the blood stained desert of the Trojan homeland? The book also includes Odysseusis treacherous journey home past a six headed serpent and right across an evil king's door step. Will he survive?  Personally I didn't like the book at all. The way it was written it didn't really pull the reader in very well and the battle sequences are O.K. but not the best. Personally I don't really enjoy some types of myths and legends. I think if you are just about to branch out and read Greek myths you shouldn't read this book first because it really turns you off to Greek myths in general, so don't think all Greek myth's are like this.  	 	 	 
 This book along with MM's first work is a fake.  Listed below is a time-line indicating this authors recent admission.  Please do not buy this book and support anyone that would exploit indigenous people.  MM is a disgusting human being.   Just "google" the topic if you have any doubts.  1996   Morgan apologises to the Aboriginals - book support retracted January 26: A delegation of 8 Aboriginal Elders leave for the United States to defend their religion and culture and to block the move by Hollywood executives at United Artists to turn Marlo Morgan's claims into a major motion picture [9, 26]. Morgan sold the film rights for U$1.8 million [11].  January 31: The elders receive an apology. "Morgan admitted for the first time to the eight elders that her work was fiction and a fabrication" [5, 26]. She said: "I would like to say that I'm terribly sorry and my sincere, my sincere apologies to any Australian Aboriginal person if I have offended them in any way." [10] Dr. John Stanton (Berndt Museum of Anthropology, WA) "said the book contained misleading and damaging information about Aboriginal people" [5]. He was not sure, he said, "whether the damage the book had done to the overseas image of Aboriginal culture, which was complex, diverse and vibrant, could be ever undone." Morgan promised a written apology, which she actually never produced [6].  March 4: Burnum Burnum retracts support for Marlo Morgan [7] in a letter to the Dumbartung Aboriginal Corporation [8].      1997   Aboriginals protest during lectures in Japan March 25: Eggington calls for "Mutant Message" and the books of two other authors to be taken from all Australian bookshelves and destroyed [14].  April 7: Dumbartung coordinates protest against Morgan's lectures in Japan. Eggington and a Bardi Elder travel there, give press conferences and appear painted and with didgeridoo and boomerangs at two venues. Morgan comments that "they represent all that is bad, and I represent all that is good". Eggington and the elders leave Japan on April 21st [26].  August 18: Burnum Burnum dies [8].  In this year another interview is published in the Golden Age (New Age magazine). Lorraine Mafi Williams, "a traditional teacher and custodian of Aboriginal culture and wisdom" talks about whether the journey was authentic and how the Aboriginal community reacted: "I honestly don't think this woman ever took a walk with anyone except perhaps as a tourist on a tour into the outback." [20]      1998   Morgan publishes a second book June 1: Harper Collins publish "Message From Forever, A Novel of Aboriginal Wisdom", by Morgan, which she claims "is really written by Aboriginal friends telling me to please do this".  October: phenomeNEWS conducts an interview with Marlo Morgan [16] in which she claims to "have gone back periodically" to the tribe she claimed to have travelled with in the first book. Despite all the uproar there has already been up to that time, phenomeNEWS claim they "were unaware of the controversy surrounding Ms. Morgan and her book" when they did the interview...      1999   Aboriginals outraged again January: Morgan seems not to have learned from the experiences with "Mutant Message". Her new book again outrages the Aboriginals in Australia. Morgan describes a woman giving birth, but "that is private women's business. For someone to (describe a birth) is insulting and offending to people and their cultural beliefs," says Ms Jo Willmot, chairwoman of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta board of management [13].  May: Film producer Michael Taylor is said to have "entered into agreements for the production of 'Messenger', based on the best seller Mutant Message Down Under" [15].     
 This was big on my 8 year-old son's Christmas list, mainly because of the Ben 10 game. He even wanted it more than any other game system. Although I wasn't about to pay full price for it, we got it at about 60% off for the main console. So we got it, paid for an extra controller, the Ben 10 Game CD, and a couple of Ben 10 Booster Packs.  The unwrapping was a hit, and the excitement of the first play-through went over great with my son. But I noticed right away that it was not going to last. The game itself contains graphics from about 10 years ago. The game play is difficult, and both my son and I would find it easy to die, thus restarting the game for both of us. You can only play with the characters that happens to have come in your game or booster packs, and that's not many. (Want more? Fork out more $$$ for more booster packs.) And finally, it takes so long to load from the CD (and it has to load EVERY level) that it must be a 1x drive. Seriously slow.  Although my son still loves the IDEA of it and has not admitted he's disappointed, he does comment on how slow it is, and how he wishes he had other kids to trade the cards with so he could get more. Apparently we were the only suckers to buy it around here. It hasn't been played but maybe 4 times in the one month since Christmas.  If you notice it to be on a HUGE discount, it may be worth it. But remember, you have to pay extra for more cards. Personally, I wish we'd bought a used GameCube with a few cartridges. That has way more staying power than the HyperScan will 
 I have listened to this CD twice now and will gladly put it away in the back of my CD cabinet.  I found the performances to be fairly good, but the material was dreadful. The music was mediocore at best and the lyrics were uninspiring. I'm not against using foul language if there's a good reason for it, but in this show it didn't seem necessary or very meaningful to the plot or character development. Most of what they are trying to accomplish here has been done better in other shows, like Forbidden Broadway. I would take a pass on this one and spend your money on something else 
 I bought this book after seeing Mr Florida talk on CSPAN-2. He does have some interesting things to say about creativity, but...  I found it very difficult to finish.  Mr Florida claims to be politically independent, but he doesn't even hesitate to engage in the sort of casual Bush bashing one see's only in the extreme left, and along with this he repeats almost every silly platitude of same, including the ridiculous "pentagon holding a bake sale to buy a bomber" bit.  If he's politically independent, then I'm the King of Siam.  And his solution? right out of the leftists playbook, we have to spend more, lots more, way more than we ever have, "several orders of magnitude more" on "education", "culture" and "the arts."  Anyone interested in buying a used book? Only read once.. 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 The author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet-related happenings. His intent seems to be to say --  The internet changes _everything_, becomes a social leveller. Youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things, but also new processes, new paradigms, and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so.  He uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by SEC, another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast, yet another writing programs to napsterize everything.  He indicates "flattening" of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations, and has this concept of "insiders" being unseated by "outsiders" due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined, developed and brought to market, thanks to the internet.  There is some truth to his observations, but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend. It is of course true that the internet gives "access" and "freedom" renewed relevance. I like to think of it as "digital democratization" of society.  
 The last review I wrote must have been in-appropriate so Let me make a final more proactive attempt at reviewing this book for the reader and purchasee of this book.  Reasons This Book Is Misleading and Not Worth $0.01 cents   A) This book was sold under misleading title and purpose.  explaination:  You thumb through the book and think, WOW! Everything I ever wanted to know about everyone else's beliefs.  The facts are not all there.  It was geared toward teenage kids who's families are big Jesus supporters.  In other words, it's going to be Pro-Jesus and ever chapter or religion will be slightly misrepresented.  The cover should say "Why So Many Gods When Jesus Is The Only One?"  Examples: Confusisionists, Buddists, and Taoists are all atheists and don't believe in god.  This is not true.  Some of them even believe in Jesus.  The fact is that they don't believe in Jesus so the author stretches the truth a bit to make this religion less appealing to teens who may choose to follow those beliefs and aiding scared parents who want their children to choose Jesus, AKA making this book the Jesus bomb scared parents want to keep them away from learning about the world by themselves.   Oh my favorite is the section on Satanists!  According to the author They have human sacrifices.  Real Satanists don't even believe in the devil according to other more Academic books about world religion.  They believe in indulging in sin and mocking christianity for believe it a business and form of control.  Writing these fact would have been more enriching.  B)If the author is too coward to put their name on the cover, There must be a reason.  Example:  I didn't find the author's name anywhere but the editor Sure was brave.    C) The backgrounds in the book are fun and make it easy to find what you are trying to relocate when you want to re-read something.  However I find it offensive they included Machine Guns when they were speaking about Islam/Taliban!  Please!  Everyone knows that radicalism such as this is not good but if you have the bravory to misrepresent ever world faith and you know not to include your name on the cover of the book... Do you really have to push that button.  You never know if your neighbor is ex-taliban... I suppose the author expected that thus chose to put the editors name on the cover  Important Note: Author Tim Baker,  Page design Mat Lehman.   I hope you didn't use real names guys, in this case I definately would not have done so, then again I let people have opinions.  D) The final reason not to buy this book. THE TRICK!  explaination:  They go as far as to treat faith as a card trick!  These are beliefs that came far before Jesus Christ.  They must have come from somewhere!  Even if they came from man, the mind has a mystery about it.  We typically use 10% of our brain although our author seems to use only 5% plus horror films and fear tatics to convince you Christianity is the only way.    Example:  The Trick Buddism page 24 "There is no god.  Then who brings them back when their dead?"  Buddism doesn't believe this.     Reincarnation is not their only belief either.  In fact I stood in the middle of a buddist temple in China that had depictions of heaven and hell.  The author's problem is that it's not christianity.    In Full... If you want a mature view on the world faiths and history the author has done a great job of making the information easy to read, enjoyable and fun for all reading levels.  The major problem is that they know they were being so biased they didn't even put their names on the cover.  The worst thing was that 75% of the people who do buy this book are going to be buying it because they saw one of the non-christian religions and the way the information is presented and thought it would be a great learning experience.  I beg to differ when you don't even research what you're writing enough to represent it fairly.    On a Final note, I fully argue that I returned my book because I made this discover within 24 hours of purchase and I will not purchase a book containing propaganda and lies about other faiths.  I will not support those tactics on anyone although the first amendment protects that right for everyone, I will not pay money to someone who does.  If you can stand the biased propaganda within there are still things to learn.  
 Fredro Starr is a good actor.in fact what ever happened to the group Onyx? but this film is cliched and Predictable.Rhea Perlman looks out of place.this is a 2nd tier Above The Rim 
 To the same level that "Silent Alarm" was a refreshing burst of high octane original post punk rock n' roll "Weekend in the City" is a disappointing pyre of overproduced electronic ennui.  I appreciate Bloc Party's artistic ambition in making such a radical departure from their previous sound, but not the art.  Even the standout track, "Uniform," which if taken as seriously as it takes itself, demands comparison to the much more subtle "Smells Like Teen Spirit," and in that context it leaves one with "a sense of disappointment. 
 I was very dissappointed in this book.  I rec'd it for Christmas and actually asked my wife to send it back.  It a pictoral of 'showrooms' (not garages) of the filthy rich.  Cars that nobody but the owner can afford. Hardly a tool can be found.  I was looking for a book that would help be design or build a very 'usable' functioning garage for the space I had.  There is nothing normal or useful in this book.  Sorry 
 I bought this book and opened it thinking that it wil be the strong version of The Animator Survival Kit, then after just 5 minutes I realized that it was a serial loose of my money because it not worth the money I paid. It has nothing that helps you to animate , is just the story of some Disney old animated movies. And the rest of it is to read a full scale of bla, bla, bla, bla that don't help in anything. But if you are a collector of Disney old stories it will be ok, so before buy it just think if you wanna draw to animate or just collect a big & heavy book with a Disney name on it 
 I started reading this book with an open mind but tossed it aside pretty quickly.  In the first dozen pages, Milton shows that he either doesn't understand that mutations are the source of variability and that it is variability that natural selection works on, or he is deliberately trying to mislead his readers.   He says on page 10/11 that Neo-Darwinists believe that species evolve into other species "not because of the trivial variation that occurs between all individuals but because of chance mutations in their genetic makeup..."  Surely most people who have an iron in this fire know that it is variation that natural selection works on, and that mutations (according to the theory) provide the variation.  I find the word "trivial" variation to be misleading, as well.  It's a word ploy.  I don't personally think of the differences between a Saint Bernard and a Beagle to be trivial.    Charles Gramlich 
 I thought I was ordering the book that the movie was based upon.  I quickly discovered that I had not.  However, I decided to read it anyway.  This book is a sequel to another Patterson book.  The book was not the usual Patterson quality and was likely an attempt to capitalize on the success of the preceding one.  
 "Tribulation Force" is not as good as the first book in the "Left Behind" series.  The authors seem to be doing so much maneuvering to get their characters into the right crucial positions around the Antichrist, that there's almost no time left for the story.   I was amused by the authors' description of the Two Witnesses and their miraculous protection by God.  If God could do that sort of miracle, why hasn't he been doing it all along?  A few incidents of such miraculous protection of missionaries would have sufficed to convert millions in countries like China and Japan, not to mention unbelievers in the U.S. Instead, missionaries sent to non-Christian nations have routinely been killed or expelled.  Why would God permit such a thing?  Does He want people to go to Hell?  Rabbi Ben-Judah's speech in "Tribulation Force" about how he's changed his mind and decided that Christ is in fact the Messiah struck me as absurd.  The Bible prophecy that "a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son" does not even appear in the original Hebrew of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word translated as "virgin" would be more correctly translated into English as "young woman."  "Virgin" is nothing more than an ancient mistranslation that has been copied and recopied over the centuries.  As for the rest of the 109 prophecies that the Rabbi claims were fulfilled by Christ, to say that Jesus Christ is the only person who could fulfill them is silly. Most of the Biblical prophecies of the Messiah are vague; with many, it's hard to say whether they even deal with the Messiah or not.  The Book of Isaiah has many of these prophecies, and it can be mighty obscure.  As we have very little solid evidence for Jesus' actual life history, it's very difficult to know if he actually fulfilled any prophecies. Certainly his followers wanted to think he did, and accounts written by his followers are the only ones we have.  The power of wishful thinking is often underestimated, in my opinion.    The "Left Behind" series takes prophecy in general much too seriously.  The Book of Revelations is essentially a collection of predictions, mostly of disasters, worded in highly symbolic language. This is the same trick that Nostradamus used in his prophecies. Since the language is so symbolic, the predictions can be applied to nearly anything. Wait long enough and bad things are, of course, sure to happen. Vague disaster predictions therefore tend to come true all the time. Since the day Revelations was written, people have popped up constantly claiming that now, at last, the predicted events are all happening, and Christ's kingdom is at hand. Is the Rapture coming this time? I don't think so. Are we likely to have some bad times ahead? Yes, but not because God planned it that way. It is humans who are now causing the biggest disasters.  As an atheist, I find the fundamentalist brand of Christianity, which loves to focus on the Rapture, even less appealing than the more ordinary kind. Fundamentalists seem to assume that "God will provide" and that we don't need to think about humanity's future.   If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.   If you are inclined to believe in the Rapture, I beg you to at least consider some contrary viewpoints. Christ said He would come as a thief in the night. Consider the possibility that He might not come for 500 more years, or 1000. Remember the parable of the talents. Do you want to face Him having ruined the planet He gave us to live on? As far as other fiction, I would suggest Heinlein's book "Job: A Comedy of Justice," which takes belief in the Rapture to its logical conclusion.  
 This guy couldn't write his way out of a Russian tea room, namely because he doesn't know Russian.  However, as a novel, I could barely keep my eyes on the TV set. What a distraction.  Please, keep your day job as a doctor. As a top diagnostician, you have touched and saved many lives.  How many novelists can say that?  I hope that you will continue to write as a hobby but please leave the publishing for your estate after your death ... which I hope isn't soon as I love your reality show about your medical career. PS: sorry about the leg. I worry you might be self-medicating 
 OK, I know people will disagree with me, but this book became unbearable somewhere in the middle & I just gave up by the time I was 3/4's done.  Historical mysteries are pretty tiresome if they are not extremely well-written & there are a few very good ones in here, but they drown in the mediocrity of the rest of the stories.  How many various time periods can you honestly claim to have believable detectives working when oftentimes the culture & history of the period would make it completely impossible for anyone to be a Holmes-like figure?  It's just too hard to suspend my disbelief long enough to get into the stories & most of them are so simplistic & easy to solve that you can turn to the end to confirm your guess & then move on to the next story.  If you're into this genre, go for it, but otherwise, pace out the stories over a long period of time to avoid burnout & try not to let the crummy ones ruin the good ones for you 
 I found this book extremely boring. Worse than a Mills and Boons novel. Your money would be better spent on anything else 
 The mouse worked great but the keyboard was very erratic. After my efforts to make it work failed, I called customer service. They do not have a toll free number but they handle the call as if they have one: there are long lists of menus to navigate through and they put you on hold forever. When someone answered the phone, I described the problem and he immediately said that the keyboard appeared defective and I should exchange it. The conversation lasted only 30 secs. Moreover, they only work from 10am to 7 pm M-F. So, I had to come homw from work to make this call.  The customer service person was nice but the whole setup is very poor and reflects badly on the company.   If the person in charge of customer service at this firm reads this, then please realize that your efforts to save money by not having toll free numbers and limited working hours will be frustrating to most customers who have come to expect a better service. With the nature of products you make, a person has to be with the product when they troubleshoot and for working people, that means having to go home during working hours.  On the whole, the wireless mouse was just awesome. I haven't worked with a functional version of their wireless keyboard yet 
 Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of fiction, but regardless, good fiction is engrossing with dynamic characters and a well-told story.  With that said, Maguire has a strong command of language and is a great writer when you examine his technique.  However, I DESPISED this story...I am familiar with the original Wizard of Oz story, and the potential of turning a classic on its head was alluring to me in addition to all of the attention that the musical is getting.  In spite of my better judgment after the first 100 pages, I kept reading.  I hated this book.  It is one of the worst stories I have read in years.  I am so mad that I paid for this.  Even worse, I wish that I had not given it a chance and saved myself 400 pages of a warped, pretentious story that attempts to question the nature of good and evil.  It fails miserably 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 The book talks too much about the author's life and his father.  Very little about the games.  Some of the material is based upon interviews with former Colts that were conducted for the author.  Some of the information about the Colts before 1952 (when they were the Dallas Texans), and particularily the Colts of the AAFC I had not heard before, but it makes up just a few pages of the book 
 This vacuum looks great and promises a lot.  But it doesn't deliver.  The unit is heavy, stiff, and awkward to move around---this applies especially to the wand.  The powerhead is too big, making it hard to maneuver into smaller places.  The dust cup is rather complicated to detach and empty.  WORST OF ALL IS THE SUCTION---there is very little suction (unless my unit was defective; a possibility, considering how crappy the suction was). I often had to pass over the same crumb multiple times to get the thing picked up.  I was so unhappy with this vacuum that I practically gave it away 
 When i saw the cover of this book i thought this would be a great book. I wanted to find pictures of beautiful decorated houses,nice gardens and offcourse the habitants of the mansions. Well, that's not quite what's inside this book. For the most only pictures of houses taken in the 50's and 60's and a lot of text!! I want pictures of Aerin Lauder and the Miller sisters! 
 I loved Steel's early works.  I read them all and they were great but have stopped reading her because her books are repetitive now.  I decided to try once again just to see and this book was maddening!!  It was 178 pages long and could have been all been said in 100 pages.  It was obvious that she was stretching it to make it a hardback "novel" length to sale.  Skip it.  
 The most frequent advice the author seems to give, is "Take a sabbatical". Iberra ofers little advice for the person who is ready for change, but simply can't afford to make it. If you make less than six figures a year, you'll find yourself asking "Uh... what am I going to eat while I do that?".     Beyind this, though, the book does deal with how to emotionally navigate the hurdles of being "between two worlds" while changing careers, so it's not a total loss.     Myself, I find that I fell into a career track that I never wanted, and know I want out. I need the financial and navigational help to move back towards where I wanted to be originally, or find something new. This book doesn't provide that, as much as the emotional support needed to convince yourself you really have chosen the wrong path.    If you're wealthy, this book will work for you. If not, you may want to look for another one, as this one has some items of use for you, but you'll have to work to find them 
 This soundtrack was a little disappointing.  I am a huge fan of James Horner's scores generally but this one failed to hit the mark.  In listening to this cd I didn't really feel it conveyed the themes of both the movie nor the Mayan culture.  
 I don't like the fact that somebody can take a horror movie and turn it into a joke!I couldn't even get through this movie once.I just don't like films that express monsters as four-legged dog creatures.The Relic is a story about a ritual gone wrong when some foolish explorer actually drinks this weird concoction from a tribe of Indians.Mysteriously enough,the liquid turns him into a beastly creature that lives in the sewers under a mansion.Don't get this movie 
 I think Heffernan may be a capable writer.  He, perhaps, captures the language and actions of the usual police department in any given city.  However, he seems to enjoy burying his readers in lots of f'ing profanity every other f'ng word.  Also, the disgusting diatribe about gays and lesbians is way over the top.  This is the second of his I've read and it will be the last.  For those who enjoy down and dirty police stories, you will like this one.  It doesn't get more down and dirty than Tarnished Blue 
 First:  the majority of the content is not compatible with the current TIVO system, series 2 *** I got SKUNKED! Second: This book is really for someone with very strong technical skills, particularly a Unix background.  I am fairly technical with a Computer Science degree and would not attempt to do anything with this book and passed it to another fairly tech savvy friend and he gave it right back to me.  There is a page or two that has cute shortcuts for the remote but you can get that info off a TIVO user group site.  I regard this purchase as a total ripoff.  I'll be happy to send you this book to you for $5 + shipping.  email: funbeach6@yahoo.co 
 I used this book for a networks class in college.  It does cover all the material that we went over in class.  Although this book does contain a lot of useful information, it is also stuffed full of some complete nonsense.  There's a lot of stupid stupid examples when they try to describe something technical with real world situtations.  Sometimes the examples don't even relate well but are just in there because the authors felt they had to force an example into the book.  Because we had to read the book for class I spent a bunch of hours reading through 500 pages of text with only 200 pages of real information.  The main problem with this book is that it's really a 200 page book expanded out to 700-800 pages and I really can't appreciate that cause I have to read so much more 
 I did a little calculating and I figure that if they sell all 20,000 (LIMITED EDITION??) of these for $40,000 each, they make $800 million.  But, the free shipping is killing them. IF they only charged $10,000 shipping, they could make a billion dollars on this book 
 There are quite a few things that I did not like about this book. Luckily I borrowed it from my Spanish teacher in 8th grade and did not have to continue my life knowing that I wasted my money on a bad book.  Some people will tell you that learning vocabulary is the hardest thing in learning a language. This is most certainly false. With proper learning techniques learning vocabulary is not difficult at all; I did, however, feel that this book introduced far too many vocabulary words at one time.  The author attempts to retard the importance of the study of grammar while learning Latin. To be successful in your study of Latin, however, you must have a very _clear_ understanding of the language's grammar. The explanations in this book cause one to develop a very fuzzy understanding that is insufficient for clear thinking, reading, translation, and composition.  I highly recommend that you do not purchase this book and instead purchase Wheelock's Latin. I am going through that book right now, and everything is very clearly explained; the number of vocabulary items introduced in each lesson is perfect in my opinion -- not too much, not too little -- and I do not ever develop that "fuzzy" understanding that came from reading this book 
 I have never played a game that crashed so often. Very frustrating. it was fun until it would crash the first time in a one hour session. But the second time in a one hour session is just Ridiculous. dont know if it is the programing or starforce but its frustrating. The game was fun for a while then became very repetitive  
 Ms. Jones is delusional thinking Jesus was a capitalist (remember the story about Jesus driving the money changers out of the Temple).  I expect her next venture will be to sell snake oil.  Instead of wasting your money on this book, why not buy a good book on astrology or the bible and skip this hallucinogenic translation 
 Overall, the book covers relevant M&A material but it's difficult to read. Coming from a finance background, I was looking for a reference book to be used at work. There are other books that are more user-friendly. Recommendation: get Applied Mergers & Acquisitions from Wiley Finance instead; same topics but a pleasure to read. 
 13 Stories, 13 Epitaphs is the second book by William Vollmann that I've read and I still am not quite sure what to make of him. The first was Butterfly Stories, a sordid tale of a journalist and photographer in Thailand chasing hookers, looking for the one with a heart of gold. 13 Stories is somewhat similar with several people who are homeless, jobless, and addicted drugs, as well as several whores. It's hard to judge his writing without considering the content he writes about, which is usually derelicts and people on the fringes of society. It makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable, I can't relate with the characters and don't find much redeeming about his stories, it doesn't seems like he has an overall plan, it's not necessarily a morality tale.  I think I've had enough of his novels 
 This book may provide some info to the totally ignorant snapper, but any decent amateur already knows these things. Moreover many concepts are not even clearly explained, and all the photos are rarely linked to the text. The useful info could have been enclosed in 20 pages booklet! As an outstanding example of superficiality, 90% of featured photos are digital, and no consideration is due to the choice of film (while portraiture often requires medium and large format films) 
 Although fantasies were given by "regular" people, I found the descriptions of making it with dogs and dreaming of what you'd do to your baby neice, not only objectionable, but just plain gross. I don't think your average person would appreciate such fantasies. Based on other  reviewers here, I thought it would be about really erotic/possibly romantic  escaapades. I had no idea it would be bizarre and ugly. I think there were  2 I liked, but they were just so-so. I wonder about an author that provides  a forum for such material 
 I bought this coffeemaker 6 weeks ago and the burner plate is pealing.I also discovered after I had water and coffee grounds all over,that you have to place the carafe with the handle to the side slightly or it will not drip properly.Hopefully, I can get my money back,and try another bran 
 I bought this for my mom who enjoyed the series and I found that I actually enjoyed it also.  The one problem, and a big one, is that the dvds are defective.  I tried playing them on three different players and the results were the same.  The pixels were messed up on several of the shows and, in two cases, stopped playing altogether.  A couple of the shows could not be watched to the end because they would start and stop and then eventually stop completely.  Returning the item is too much of a headache so we decided to let it go.  I also purchased seasons 1 and 3 for her and have no such problems.  One I believe I purchased through Amazon and the other elsewhere.  We just decided we will be purchasing no more boxed sets in this series.   
 This book has fundamental information about crafting a business. I would recomend this book to all business students 
 Al Franken is an individual who has been mediocre at everything, this book is his attempt to take on radio giant, rush limbaugh.  All I can say is; it is a good thing Mr Franken used Rush's name on the title, otherwise this book would have been like every other Franken project: an abject failure.  If you are easily entertained by shrill, and hysterical name calling this book is for you.  I found it sophmoric, and superficial, pretty much like Al 
 Too much touchy/feely/wuzzly/buzzly romance in book.  For the first time in years, I will not be getting the sequel to a Lois McMaster Bujold book.  I'm more of a sci-fi fan than fantasy, but GOOD fantasy does have a place on my bookshelf.  This belongs on the romance shelf and not on mine 
 Newton has no concept of reality.  This collection is nothing but more feminist banter standing upon a foundation of pagan thought at a teenage comprehension level.  Whether you find yourself rooting with liberals or conservatives there is no level of scholarship to be found anywhere the truth has been subdued 
 Maggio's list of biased words includes many everyday words and expressions that are part and parcel of the English language. If everyone were to follow her lead, our language would be much poorer. In the quest to remove everything from the language that might give offense to anybody, Maggio ends up with a list of censorship guidelines. Publishers should avoid following her list, as it gives permission to censors of all stripes--whether from left, right, feminist, anti-evolutionist, crackpot--to say that something offends them and take it out of the language 
 i have read just about every popular book on horserace betting and the acid test is: does it help beat the races? the name of the game in betting thorougbreds is data mining and processing, which can only be done with software on a computer. i have software that allowed me to test some of the factors cited in this and other popular books. the bottom line... yes you get a high percentage of winners but unfortunately these horses are overbet, indicating that the info in this and other popular books is well known and used by the betting public. to beat the horses you have to think outside the box. so in conclusion don't waste your time reading this book. 
 how could someone who can't talk and see write a book? i don't get it at all. . . this book is black magic/ the work of the devil. my christian youth group told me that satan likes this book so I will go and read my bible 
 I know APR is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there, and I think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine, but it's more of the National Enquirer of poetry magazines. It's a large, newspaper-style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles. You'd be better off subscribing to Poetry, The Hudson Review, The Texas Review, Tar River Poetry, or any number of other journals 
 I was excited to see what all the fuss was about after hearing about kettlebells and what an effective training tool they are.  However, after  reading this book it was evident that it is incomplete and poorly conceived, of poor quality and lacking in too many areas to be taken seriously.  (Also, it has since been superceded by "Enter the Kettlebell" in which Pavel contradicts himself.)  I was confused by the many typographical errors with whole paragraphs being repeated out of sequence in non-related chapters and the lack of photographs required to do a good job of conveying how to properly execute the various movements.  This could be quite dangerous for the trainee who doesn't have the time, money or inclination to spend $1500-2000 to take a beginners kettlebell course.  Surely this must be a Russian plot to bilk hard-working Americans out of their money and send them on a mission of useless training programs?  I got the distinct impression that Pavel's books are written in serial fashion to either 1) convince you that you MUST take a "certified" kettlebell course or (2) get you to buy more expensive books or (3)get you to buy expensive DVD's.  "Take down that wall Gorby"...so those wacky Russians can experience the American dream by selling over-hyped books supposedly containing valuable Russian training "secrets".  As much as the kettlebell "cultists" would like you to believe how great they are, fortunately most of us are not confined to a Russian gulag or currently in exile in Siberia working out with balls of iron with a handle in the sub-freezing cold, performaing boring, mind numbing endless repetitions of snatches and swings.  No, here in America, a long time ago, someone came up with the idea of ADJUSTABLE dumbells and barbells with which you can progressively add weight and thereby grow in strength and muscularity.  Plenty of trainees around the world have built great physiques and strength without ever having touched a kettlebell.  Keep that in mind and try to see past the hype 
 this book is tiresome to say the least  what is the point?  we should all kill ourselves  then maybe there will be peace  for heaven sakes on the way to getting the sleeping pills  don't anyone have a contrary opinio 
 Richard Florida divides people into two groups, those in the creative class such as artists, musicians, and engineers and those not in the creative class, mainly people not engaged in so called "creative work". Based on his research into the characteristics of these groups he concludes that India and China are not the real threat in terms of high tech competition and it is the smaller European nations with more open political climates that are the real threat.  Obviously, Florida is not an engineer or a real scientist since anyone in the high tech field knows that India and China are the main competition for high tech jobs and the massive offshoring of engineering jobs is even lowering the number of students in college pursuing these fields.  The main problem is that Florida doesn't realize that an engineer with a 4 year university degree is not the same as a writer, musician or artist that may have no education at all especially in difficult math and science courses.  He mistakenly believes these two separate groups to be equal and the same in terms of contributing to high tech innovation and development.  For writers an open political climate is necessary to make a living writing controversial books.  However, for an engineer an open political climate is not essential in most cases but a stable  modern environment where he feels confortable living and working is needed.  Furthermore, Florida makes a huge deal about the "Gay Index" where high concentration of gays indicate a high concentration of the creative class and high tech innovation.    This may be true in western civilization but in China and India it is irrelavant.  Florida also seems to have given up on his "Technology" element of economic development for America because in his latest article for USA Today he states something to the effect that high tech innovation can be outsourced anywhere and America can only maintain its lead if it concentrated on "culture", "art", "music" and "improving retail service" jobs.       In conclusion, Richard Florida's creative class theory where "Talent", "Technology", and "Tolerance" is needed for economic development is fundamentally flawed.  Florida's writings lack the rigor and unbiased analysis of a real engineer or scientist but is designed to sell books to a socially liberal audience.    
 This is a wordy, diatribe on brain mechanics.    The best that can be said is that Dr. Goldberg is considering establishing for profit cognitive enhancements centers along side retirement chains around the nation.  In chapter 15, Goldberg gives ancedotes about the aging who benefit from attending his cognitive center.  He does not describe the contents of the computer programs they use.  (trade secrets?)  This center offers, "personal cognitive fitness trainers and a broad, all inclusive cognitive cocktail." (whatever that may be?)  All this and a 'bag of chips' are sure to be expensive.  My pattern recognition system has seen this sleaz before.  It used to show up on television in the wee hours of the morning.  The 'informercial' has now hit the scientific community and book publishing 
 Absolutely one of the worst books of all time.  It took at minimum sixty pages to realize the heifer was missing and then it was downhill from there.  I had such high hopes for this book, but it is not worth your time, so don't bother.  I was mentally ticking off all bayous convenient to NOLA so at least half of the characters could be dumped.    I will give the author another chance, but if her main character is as snotty in the rest of the books, forget it.  That goes for the rest of the characters.     
 Having invested heavily in a single stock - WorldComm - Paulos laments his financial loss, and embarks to write a book where he takes the reader through a spectrum of equities analysis methodologies, and disproves their apparent success as attributes of illusions and perceptions. Through the use of thought experiments, he attempts to re-wire the readers to comprehend the true nature of randomness, which is more ordered than most people's expectations.   The good stuff aside, I am very disappointed with the book for two reasons. Firstly, the publisher's marketing of the book is highly misleading. It hints that the author used his professional skills as a mathematician to beat the market. As such I bought the book hoping to understand why the author failed, and hope to avoid his pitfalls. Instead, the author did not have any first hand experience with any of the techniques discussed. He simply did not apply any mathematical methods, or any method for that matter, during his compulsive purchase of WorldComm shares. So anyone hoping for case studies would be let down.   Secondly, Paulos' arguments are not all that convincing. While he successfully presents an alternative hypothesis based on the incorrect human perceptions of probability, he makes no attempts to disprove established theories. All he has achieved is simply to offer another explanation. The section on technical analysis is particularly poor, as his arguments were rather superficial, and amounted to simply saying technical analysts have not provided convincing prove - he does not feel he needs to go any further. What is confusing to me, is that he rejects technical analysis despite giving a marvellous introduction, and goes on to explain how and why technical patterns form, as well as admitting throughout the book that the psychology of the market is what moves prices - one of several core principles of technical analysis.   Having said all that, "A Mathematician Plays the Market" is an eye-opener in lateral thinking for the non-mathematically inclined, and is a recommended read for financial novices. Professionals in either fields can give this book a miss 
 This is the cheesiest music ever. Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Chaka Khan? Are you kidding me? These were the worst artists of the 80's. Where's U2, REM, the Pixies, X, the Pretenders, Tom Petty, Prince, Springsteen, the Replacements, Husker Du? Does anyone like Rock and Roll? Phil Collins writes songs for Disney and Pixar now! What did Glenn Frey know about 'Smugglers Blues'? Do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart? These are the worst artists, songwriters and performers of the 80's.  Enjoy the nostalgia, but the art which is song is seriously missing on this CD.  
 It has good information, but if you are looking for an in-depth more complete book, this may not be the way to go.  
 Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened 
 I was hoping there would be some new info in this book, but there was none. ZIP!!! I still find it interesting that after running a stop sign and killing an innocent driver, that she still has NO comments. None of her friends think it was "a big deal" - that they all just "moved on."  Moved where? In the State of Washington she would be charged with vehicular homicide. It's a serious charge here. I can't help but wonder had it been Hilary Clinton, what the thoughts would be. Lots of reference to her "sorority sisters" - which was annoying. But in a way it helped me to understand exactly where she came from and why she is the way she is today. Don't buy this book 
 Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead 
 What a boring love story - I wasn't impressed.  Bizarre plot, long tedious read 
 Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed 
 The opening sentence is the only thing I found interesting about this Novel. After the second chapter I get sick of the Qestions followed by almost next to no answers. I will try this book again when I am 30. 
 This latest translation of the Chinese Taoist Classic is a dry and lifeless specimen, not surprising from a man whose translation of the I Ching was praised for "having no truck with 'timeless wisdom.'" (back cover blurb).  This volume's claim to fame, beyond its slim and attractive appearance, is the complete translation of Wang Bi, a 23 year old commentator from 3rd century CE China.  To determine whether this translation is for you, you should know that Wang Bi had a strong inclination toward political interpretation, a proclivity probably due to the "high official status and prestige" of his family and their role in government and politics [p. 9], a trend furthered by his great-uncle's "Treatise on Keeping One's Person Safe"-which begins by making government secure [p. 10].  (Now there's a Chinese virtue, eh?)  Consider also Wang Bi's answer as to why Confucius never spoke of nothingness while Lao Tzu spoke of it incessantly (as the Mother of the Ten Thousand Things etc.):  "The Sage [Confucius] embodied nothingness so he also knew that it could not be explained in words....Master Lao...constantly discussed nothingness...for what he said about it always fell short [p. 12]."   Now if you believe that someone who could say that actually knew anything firsthand about the Tao, then this book is for you.  And if you are interested in Wang Bi, see Ellen Chen's superb translation/commentary which puts it in perspective.  Otherwise, this is a book on Te-social virtue-where the scholarship is impeccable and the feeling is weak.  And that's the Way it is 
 While I don't enjoy writing unfavorable reviews, this "book" deserves it. The so-called advice is mostly nonsense. I was hoping for some insight from some industry superstars, but instead I got filler that anyone trying to fill space could have written. This razor thin book has over 50 pages of Real Estate Glossary words and "Power Words and Phrases." Nonsense.  Also, advice like, "The negotiated contract typically goes first to the buyer's and seller's attorneys for review." (page 102)...is total BS. Where oh where did the author get this nugget! Not in the real world, but probably from some other RE advice book she researched that was is also wrong. If you are uncomfortable reviewing real estate contracts for your clients, then maybe you should consider another profession.   Other, much more informative, realistic books on the business of real estate sales that you might consider are: Real Esatate Marketing and Sales Essentials, by Dan Hamilton, or Mastering the Art of Selling Real Estate, by Tom Hopkins 
 Yep, this cd sucks. That Depeche Mode guy is really random, what makes you think anyone who is looking at the punk-o-rama review would be interested in Depeche Mode? REM sucks too, Michael Stipe is the most self absorbed old bald guy ever. 
 The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money 
 It is obvious the makers of this film were trying to create some kind of action-comedy hybrid, however it just doesn't work. The action scenes seem tacked-on and the gags just don't work.  
 Scott, working with Andre de Toth, who worked with him in Stranger Wore A Gun, finds himself in a film that does not stack up against the Budd Boetticher Western he made around the same period.  Scott plays a rancher in a range war against a bigger, powerful rancher, who has married the woman Scott loves. Scott tries to refrain from violence, but when the other rancher hires gunmen to kill Scott, Scott has to defend himself.  Westerns often feature a plot that has been done many times before, but are distinguished by great writing, great action, and great performances, and this film features none of these things. It is great that this film has been released on DVD, but it will not be remembered as one of Scott's better films 
 If you're a horse lover then you will like this story. It's a fun, unchallenging read, however, it's contrived, cliche, and Miss Leland has no confidence whatsoever in her reader's intelligence. Everything is pointed out to you, "She smiled because she was so happy," etc. The plot leaves something to be desired as well as most of the book is Beth and Conner "Brett" Hall, continually rehashing how much they like eachother and want to have sex with one another, with little else going on except the random accidents that are supposed to suffice as plot twists. Personally, I'm tired of equestrian fiction being held to a lower standard of writing than the basest high school novel. The Saddle Club has more interesting story lines than this book 
 I have had my MSCE+I and CCNA certifications since 1999, and I am an experienced Windows network administrator.  I purchased this book when I decided to round out my resume with an A+ certification.  I just want to voice my agreement with those who have given a similar rating, especially with respect to the O/S Technologies Exam and networking in general.  This text is full of errors and emphasizes legacy technology.  Regardless of whatever potential value it might have as an aid to pass the certification examinations, this text could very well do more harm than good as a general training tool for a novice technician working in a real-world production environment due to its many errors and a novice's inability to tell a good text from a bad.  In my humble opinion, one should simply not buy this book 
 First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book 
 A very medicore musical selection.  Only 39:11 minutes of music and a 40 second chop on Amie, the best song on the CD, makes this less than worthless 
 I got this book to make petit fours.  The recipe is the pits.  The genoise came out like a garden tile.  I tired it twice 
 This recording is just ok.  I didn't see why she needed to do a cover cd patti is so much better than this and it's not that she is singing the songs just ok it's just that she doesn't add anything different to them to make me say yeah thats it.  make the next recording will be the one i can enjoy until then i guess i will put "flame' my favorite patti cd 
 unable to view because of incompatible format (as you warned me!)However, my ancestor James McLintock of Barnsley, Yorkshire, England sent John Wayne an eiderdown quilt for making the film (which is why I wanted the DVD)so..... 
 man i wish they would make the round house for dvd , now that was the show right there that tought me everything i needed to know growing up 
 I'm not going to say I'm a long-time Death Cab fan, but my fondness for the band has led me through their entire catalogue, from Transatlanticism all the way back to You Can Play These Songs With Chords, my personal favorite being We Have The Facts... I tend to prefer lo-fi indie rock, though the sheer strength of Death Cab's songwriting kept me a fan up through Trans.   A lot of people will think I'm ridiculous for saying that this is Death Cab's worst batch of songs ever. Sure, the lyrics for Follow You Into The Dark flow perfectly from one line to the next and are even visually vivid, but it doesn't even sound like Ben Gibbard is trying anymore. It's the distillation of all the clever word-play he's been perfecting over the years, and this is the pinnacle, except the key ingredient - emotional conviction - is noticably absent. That seems to be the best way for me to describe Plans - perfectly clever and absolutely predictable songs that rely on studio polish instead of sincerity.  This is fiction, not fact, for the first time in years.   It's a trait noticable down to the CD cover. Something About Airplanes comes with a textured CD book with holes punched through so you can see the subsequent pages, where-as Plans comes with a glossy, plasticy booklet. It's an entirely different aesthetic at work than on the previous albums that seemed so uniquely vulnerable.   To be fair, there's only one other person I know who detests this album like I do, so odds are, if you're reading this review, you will in fact enjoy Plans. My guess is that most Death Cab fans have already purchased this and made up their minds, or have decided to steer clear altogether. If you heard DCfC on the radio, it's more than likely that big studio productions don't grate on your nerves the way they do on me, so you probably won't have the same qualms with the album I do. I just had to throw in my two cents and hope that some of you will check out Death Cab's earlier work, because this is far far far from their best. And if "lo-fi" scares you, check out The Photo Album. It's a good example of polished integrity 
 Judith Newman's memoir of becoming a first-time mother of twins in her early forties is more than light reading, but much less than it could have been. Newman writes well, she's funny and, yes, she's honest, but SELECTIVELY honest -- for one thing, how does a freelance writer, even for top-shelf magazines and newspapers, come by those tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars she almost casually strews everywhere in pursuit of Manhattan real estate, nannies, baby clothes and all the other accoutrements of modern living? You get the feeling that there is a lot she's not telling you.   Newman, a dyed-in-the-wool urban sophisticate who moves easily among Manhattan's media elite, is good at what she does and is nobody's fool. She is well trained to see all glasses as half-empty, and this is one media professional who turns a gimlet eye on the media; parents' magazines, kids' TV (save for 'Sesame Street' and 'Mister Rogers'), and even 'Goodnight Moon' come in for a pasting. Would that her critical judgment was as finely honed where her personal life is concerned. This book, amusing and a page-turner though it is, turns into a classic illustration of Smart Women, Foolish Choices. By the end of the book, you wonder why on earth she's stayed with her superannuated, selfish jerk of a husband (one wonders what his reaction was when he read his wife's extremely unflattering depiction of him, that is, if he bothered to read the book at all), not to mention the controlling Jamaican nanny (whose sister she hired for the twins' first three months at $250 a day!), not to mention her judgment in keeping a golden retriever in a cramped Manhattan apartment, even after the twins were born. Then again, perhaps Newman and her husband are more compatible than even she likes to admit -- her fundamentally self-indulgent nature comes through on every page.  Paradoxically, Newman, while she ably satirizes the schadenfreude-filled, absurdly competitive, ridiculously expensive lives of her peers, is unable to avoid falling into the same traps herself. This limits the sympathy you feel for her, even as it increases the sympathy you feel for her two boys (by far the most affectionately drawn individuals in the book).  The diary format,  which divides the 306-page book into easily digestible little clumps, is reader-friendly but ultimately limiting. There is no real conclusion; instead, it just limps to a close arbitrarily (publishers' deadlines, you know). You lament that she's still with her frequently absent husband, with THAT nanny, even still waiting for the renovation of her 'extra' apartment to be completed.   As a recent first-time father of twins, I find the ring of the familiar in much of what Newman writes of her children. However, most of America, let alone the world, lives in a far different reality than the author of this book, who has confirmed for me, once again, that the people who live in Manhattan are among the most screwed-up folk on the face of the earth. (As a native New Yorker, I'm entitled to say this.)  
 I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of 
 I did not get the plug in transmiter, I only got the collar, I would like to know if I make a mistake by ordering this product, I was waiting for the collar and something else to set the perimeter for a zone.  I got the collar but without the transmiter to set the zone this collar is not good at all. I would like to know why I did not get everything together, because it does not make any sence in buying the collar if there is nothing to set the perimet for the area. According to the direction this transmiter you plug in 110 volts outlet.  So please help me with this,  Thans Willyam Galve 
 Beckwith is a long-time Mormon-basher who has been shown to be so wrong it's a wonder he has the audacity to keep writing.  He was taken apart and handed his errors in the book "How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God."  That's why he's come up with this book.  He knows scholarly LDS writers are more than he can stand up to.  There is not enough space here to illustrate the errors of the classical theist and their mixture of Judaism, Greek and Oriental philosophy, and paganism.  Instead I will recommend two books: 1. How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God. 2. The Father is Not the Son.  The first book especially knocks Beckwith out of the argument over the Trinity. Very few people accept the classical theists view of the Trinity, which was a figment of man's imagination during the Middle Ages.  These books easily prove the errors of the classical theist.  Even if one is so stubborn as to hang on to the metaphysical beliefs of the classical theist, it would be good to know the other side, if just for the knowledge in talking with more enlightened thinkers. One example: The ancient Jews had no concept of metaphysics. As the Jewish Reviewer: Seth J. Frantzman (Jerusalem, Israel)has said here,"..just Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and circumcision". However, before he accuses Mormons of being viscious, he needs to look at the thousands of years of Hebrew wars and slaughtering that is throughout the Pentatuch. Where does he find that in LDS history? Oh, yeah, the Mountain Meadows Massacre, but that was by renegade Mormons, not the Church. The rest of the Mormons didn't even know what happened until they were told about it.  The Jews were realists and meant what they said even when figuratively speaking.  The Greeks dealt with just about everything using metaphysics, the more abstruse the better, it seems.  The scriptures were revealed to the Jews, not the Greeks.  Why, then, did metaphysics--i.e. the Trinity, incorporeality of God, incomprehensibility of God, etc.--creep into Christian doctrine?  These books will explain that.    Good, faithful Christians truly think they believe the Bible only.  Unfortunately, they do not realize the errors of their doctrines due to the metaphysics that crept in during the years of the apostasy after the original apostles died.  However, people like Beckwith should know this. But, then, what would they write on to make money from books?  How about the truth?  As you read this you will notice the "reviewers" who have read my review here will say this review was not helpful to them.  Of course it isn't.  When you are looking for "literature" to help you criticize and blaspheme other religions, you are not going to get much help from this review. Your mind is already made up,and it is certainly not open to any other idea.  This is also proof that they did not read the books recommended in my review here.  I challenge those that got "no help" (because they didn't want help (They were looking for "ammunition" to "shoot down" the Mormons) from this review to read those books, then come back and tell me where they are wrong and how they can support the metaphysics in "orthodox Christianity 
 Okay, so the purported author is a rambling old woman in her 70s, but that doesn't mean you will want to bear with this meandering narrative. There isn't much to pull you through--smashing idols with feet of clay? Yawn. Gore Vidal is so much more satisfyingly acidic. Concern for any of the characters? Not much. Fanny T. escapes what little peril she's in during one short chapter. White's descriptions of the characters who populate are marvelous but it's not worth the long sludgy haul to get to them. I'm fond of some of White's other work and thus am disappointed in this one 
 I ordered this A/V cable for a client showing since I didn't want to carry extra baggage.  The cable arrived in time, but on plugging it in I found the cable damaged by a short in the video side.  Since, it only cost $20 bucks, I threw it in the trash and bought a more expensive cable at my local Radio Shack.  I'm sure if it worked I would continue to use it with my iPod, but alas it's history 
 Based on the other reviews I must have read a different book. But seriously Payback bills itself on the ideas behind creating practical and actionable innovation, how else could you meet the promise of 'reaping the rewards of innovation.'  Unfortunately the rewards they are talking about are all in terms of cash and profits making this book a 101 finance book built around the authors notion of the Cash Curve with the following basic tenants:  - don't spend to much to create an idea because that consumes upfront cash - don't take too long to commercialize and bring the idea to market - get your idea into volume production as soon as possible - support the idea with a measured post launch investment.  Sorry but that's it. The book is heavy on the finance 101 side and extremely light on the idea of practices and ideas. Sure they say that you can play different role: innovation integrator, orchestrator, or liscensor but you pretty much know what the authors are going to say just by the role names.  The book does have an number of case studies, many that are available in the public domain, however these cases are more narrative telling you what happened without being analytical and telling you why the did this or that and the result it took.  Overall this book is very light on the ideas and actions required to deliver the rewards of innovation because it treats innovation as a financing event that is intended to generate cash. While that view is true, there is allot of insight, actions and practices that must happen before we can start thinking about how to get cash out of an innovation. I only hoped that the authors had taken the time to tell us that.   
 This is a truly amazing book! This is a book written by a highly uneducated person for even less educated reader. As the author says in the introduction, this book is designed for young people of all ages... Well, what's that, "young of all ages?"  Simple: those "whose imagination has not been stifled by standard educational process."  At the very outset, the author reassures the reader that the book is not going to be a technical or scientific one. He says with a poorly concealed pride "My brush with academia was a fairly short one:  I was expelled from kindergarten at the age of four... and have never managed to resume normal studies since, not to mention graduating from anyplace."  As a result, "I am a fairly stupid fellow who could not learn any mathematics at all."  This lack of really serious knowledge of anything does not prevent the author from making judgments, always with a sort of  "elegance of ignorance", regarding very big topics, like, say, theory of relativity, and holography, and brain functioning (through electromagnetic and sound vibrations), and Biggg Banggg, of course. So, my recommendation to those with at least K12 education: do not waste time and find a better way to spend $9.97.    The most surprising aspect of  this book is that Dr. William Tiller, a  respected scientist and writer, found it possible to write a preface for this book.  This preface is the best part of the book. 
 It is a pretty common thing nowadays for Russians to try and sell their "secrets" to the west now that the cold war is over. It is particularly interesting to learn what their "secret services" might have done, since they used to be our enemies and our government worked awfully hard to make them look evil. More than a few Russians are making bank by fabricating material to sell to an eager yet naive western population.  That is precisely what this book is. There is over a hundred photos of the author in this book, but he does not look physically fit. He looks like a former gulag prisoner. There are lots of quotes from famous communists in the book, but most of them are false and completely misplaced. They are false attempts to make readers think the author is the real deal.  Here is where he fails: First, nobody in their right mind wants to look like a gulag prisoner. The purpose in physical training is to look GOOD, to look fit. The author doesn't look good at all, except for his abdominal muscles. No, he looks like an Auschwitz (or Sukhanovka, the Soviet equivalent) survivor. And the author's description of the Soviet system of training is completely wrong. Nobody is going to be able to convince me that the secret of Soviet training was LIMITED reps, LIMITED sets, MAXIMUM rest between sets. That is what the author is trying to sell here, and it is sheer garbage. The Soviet system was built on the ability to survive incredible hardship. Their athletes did well because they were incredibly tough. I have studied the former USSR's national volleyball team's training methods so I know. Their was nothing "limited" about it: They would train all night long, no rest, no food, no water. 'Just like Stalin and his henchmen used to work all night, like Gulag prisoners would work until they died. And on the subject of Stalin: The author MISQUOTES Joseph Stalin saying people should do "limited sets." Joseph Stalin never said that, unless it was when he was drunk or perhaps on June 21, 1941 (when he refused to believe the Germans were going to invade the USSR). Stalin's system was built on excessive, extended physical punishment to EVERYBODY, friends and foes. That is the complete opposite of "limited" work, and what the author of this book is trying to sell. If the Soviet Union was built or run using the principles offered in this book it would have become part of Nazi Germany in 1941.   This book is a pretty good PR job, but misses the mark completely. 
 Not the best book to read on the subject, lacked a lot of information and found it to be not very interesting. Have read better ones on this subject 
 Seriously though, has anyone else ever realized that 90's punk in particular just... sucks? I mean all punk is pretty terrible, but something happened in the 90's that decided to make it worse than it already was...  Hearing 3 seconds of this garbage makes you just wanna go out and blow away any stupid jerk you see sporting a mohawk. I mean really blow them away, like the guy at the beginning of Robocop.  Well, that's pretty much all I gotta say.. 
 As someone who is very interested in oil and it's effects on the global economy, I looked forward to reading this book with great interest.   The Leebs go through a cursory analysis of the state of the current oil supply.  The question of when we will reach peak oil production is open to great debate with estimates varying widely depending on who is asked.  The Leebs assume that we will arrive at our peak oil consumption in this decade and predict $100/barrel oil by 2010.    They may be right, they may be wrong.  I am not troubled by their prediction of $100 oil; however, their conclusion that $100+ oil will cause hyperinflation is stated as fact with no real evidence to substantiate their belief.  In fact, many economists will argue that rapidly increasing oil prices could be deflationary or only marginally inflationary.  The Leebs assume that the oil embargo of the 1970s and the resulting inflationary spiral that occurred in the U.S. will occurr again as oil prices march steadily higher.  This logic is flawed for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that a steady, measured rise in prices allows time for the global economy to adapt to higher oil prices in ways that a sudden oil shock does not.    Furthermore, some economists argue that higher oil prices could be deflationary.  The Leebs ignore the fact that we are living in a globalized and highly competitive environment that is very different from the world of the late 70s.  If companies are having greater difficulty passing along higher energy costs to consumers; profit margins will contract, investment in R&D and new manufacturing capacity will slow, job groth will stagnate, and deflation will be as great, if not more of a threat, than inflation.  When manufactures are able to pass higher energy prices to consumers, the higher costs will tend to suppress demand thereby limiting economic and wage growth.    Personally, I think they got it wrong.  The Leebs do not support their basic premise that higher oil prices will lead to inflation; they accept it as received wisdom.  For this reason, everything that flows from their assumption of hyperinflation is flawed.  
 I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it 
   Grayling combines factual information with dubious assertions and a very incomplete picture of the killings of civilians during the WWII air war. The only strength of his book is the existence of detailed maps, as well as a table of all bombing raids. One of the maps shows the bombed German cities as pie charts, with the diameter of the pie representing the size of the city and the blackened portion of the pie depicting the fraction of the housing destroyed by Allied bombing. Another map shows concentric circles depicting the distances to bomber bases in the British Isles. However, this ignores the fact that many bombing raids were also carried out from Allied-captured Italy in the latter stages of the war.  Among the many dubious assertions of Grayling is the one regarding German bombers. Grayling rejects the contention that massive Allied bombing at least forced the Germans to build a large fleet of fighter planes at the expense of their own bombers. He argues that the Germans' use of V-1 and V-2 rockets eliminated the need for a large bomber fleet. This seems ridiculous. The total damage done by the German rocket weapons is dwarfed by the damage that would have been caused by a large and long-range would-be German bomber force. Besides, these never-built German bombers could have been used alongside, and not instead of, the V-1 and V-2 rockets.  The current Judeocentric approach to WWII depicts Jews as the only victims of the Nazis worthy of repeated discussion. Not surprisingly, Grayling follows this trend. He exclusively compares what he considers the lesser immorality of Allied carpet bombing with the greater immorality of the Germans' murder of the Jews. He not only ignores the millions of non-Jews murdered by the Germans, but pointedly ignores the MAIN civilian victims of German bombing. In fact, another reviewer has already commented on the fact that Grayling completely ignores the Luftwaffe activities on the eastern front. What an understatement! Grayling's criticisms, on both tactical and moral grounds, of Allied bombing raids that killed considerable numbers of civilians should start with the very beginning of World War II. Already in the predawn hours of September 1, 1939, the Luftwaffe was slaughtering tens of thousands of Polish civilians in indiscriminate attacks on non-military targets. Grayling mentions Warsaw only twice, and then in a very cursory fashion. He justifies the ignoring of Warsaw compared with Rotterdam on the basis of the fact that Warsaw was far away from the west, and thus its experiences were not well known. That may have been true during the early stages of the war but it is certainly not true now--least of all for Grayling.   In Warsaw alone tens of thousands of Polish civilians perished in three weeks of furious German bombardment. Not until some 3 years into the war did a single Allied air raid cost the lives of 10,000 or more German or Japanese civilians! Grayling ignores the fact that German attacks on such places as Guernica, Rotterdam, and London were primarily tactical in nature. In contrast, German attacks against the Poles, and later other Slavs, were motivated by genocide. Hitler himself stated at the start of the war that Germans should "Kill without mercy every man, woman, and child of Polish extraction." Three million Polish gentiles were murdered by the Germans during the German occupation. In time, Warsaw became the deadest city of all, nearly 100% destroyed as a deliberate act of cultural genocide directed against the Poles. No other European capital came close to this level of devastation. The Germans did not blow up the militarily-innocent cultural cities of Krakow and Czestochowa only because they failed to complete the laying of the explosive charges before the unexpectedly-early arrival of the Red Army.  Personally, and again after having read Grayling's book, I find it difficult to feel sorry for the Germans for at least two reasons. The first is their long history of aggression against the Slavic peoples. The second is the fact that 89% of the Germans voted for the Nazis in free elections, all the while fully knowing who Hitler was and what he stood for (after all, Hitler had written his infamous Mein Kampf a decade earlier).  
 Unfortunately, this application includes only a Mac OS 9 (not the Mac OS X as advertised) version.  I cannot review the cds in general, as I cannot run them.  Why did they re-publish the 1998 software in 2006, again in Mac OS 9?  Frustrating 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
 Okay so this review is a bit premature being that I've read up to the 16th page so far but I am highly irritated by all the complex words the author is using---especially for a story of BASKETBALL. The wording is making it difficult for the story to flow 
 Would like let you know that my below review is after listening to it only once. So if you have heard real good review and would like to give it a try.. then go ahead and buy.  I didn't like bit from the time I played. In fact I wasn't planning to buy this at all. I was buying "AniMusic" DVD after watching it on PBS and this was shown as a another good DVD to buy along with. I went ahead and purchased it since I saw the rating to be 4 and 1/2 stars. Now I wonder I shouldn't take the rating so seriously. I feel that its not worth to buy. When there are free music files available on net for free which sounds much better than this. Paying money to get this visualizations is useless to my knowledge.  Just to give you a hint, video is something like a visualization available in any multi media player software in your PC. BGM didn't sound great either 
 look, the secret to law school is finding the 1 hornbook you need to survive your class. this is not it. (sorry harvard.)  this is poorly written. most indications seem to be that gilbert's is much better. for what it's worth, the other things you need are: chirelstein for contracts; glannon for civ pro; there's nothing for torts, but i suppose glannon for torts is better than the rest; chemerinsky for conlaw; i don't know if there's one for criminal, but I used gilberts. this is poorly written and poorly explained. I've heard that gilbert's is better 
 This toy is fun... but a bit on the creepy side.  Also, it loses its appeal kind of fast 
 I happened upon this book in the bookstore, and also recently saw it mentioned in Harper's Bazar.  All they say is that it is a "comprehensive history of footware."  What they fail to mention is that all the pictures are illustrations.  There is not one single color photograph of an original shoe.  If you check the product description above that Amazon provides, it does tell you that it has illustrations, but many people don't know to look there.   While the drawings are nicely done, they didn't give me the same thrill that seeing an actual photo of an original shoe would have.  The pictures on the cover are exactly the same type of drawing and the same type of composition that you will see of other shoes in the book.  I can understand having drawings of shoes from hundreds of years ago, but not having any photos of modern shoes seems a cop out.  The book is informative, but I think it is in no way "complete." It gives an overview of shoes from different eras, but does not scratch much beyond the surface. So, you get a little of everything and some representative pictures of the average footware, but not a good sense of what might be unique about a particular time period beyond what you can see for yourself in the illustrations.   I've read other books on fashion history that do a better job than this book in covering a wide range of time periods (such as Decades of Beauty).  However, these books did not contain only shoes.  I have yet to find a book about shoes that has both good photographs and informative text.    So, due to lack of competition, some people may want to check this book out because there isn't anything else out there.  But, I would not reccomend buying it sight unseen.  I think that this book would be too elementary for a fashion historan or someone into the history of shoes, but too boring for the average person to want to buy.  I definitely would not recommend it for someone with a shoe fetish.  It was worth the time I spent looking through it at the bookstore because of some of the text, but mostly because of the lack of photos I did not buy it 
  OK so i got this gun for christmas and i open it and i'm so excited. Then i play with it, its working then i go to charge it boom. 8 hours later its dead the gun will not work. I checked the battery it has full juice. I had my dad and uncles look and try to fix this for about 2 hours they could not figure it out. Currently my uncle is going to take the gun apart and try to fix it. DO NOT BUY THIS GUN OR ANY OTHER TOYS OR AIRSOFT GUNS FROM THIS COMPANY! PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS IT IS A RIP OF AND THE COMPANY HAS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER REVIEWS! That is my review and i am a kid and im doing this on my moms nam 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 That so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me. Luckily, I bought this book used, otherwise I might be kicking myself for paying full price. Between her utterly uninspired "devotional dances" to things such as sex, wisdom, and the "Sticky One" (a term she made up for the astral body), and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to "anoint" it, I was unimpressed, to say the least. However, driving on a trip a friend and I got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book. It's very, very amusing if you don't take it seriously. The thing that makes me sad is that she's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth. There's nothing evolutionary about it, unless you consider being a wanton, idiotic freak "evolutionary". If this is what humanity is evolving into, I am frightend 
 Don't get me wrong.  I love Bill Murray and I'm so happy to see him get the critical attention he's deserved.  But these Wes Anderson "comedies" are just lame.  RUSHMORE started out with a lot of promise but fizzled out.  THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS was a two-hour set-up without ever starting any story (it felt like two-hours even if it wasn't).  And now THE LIFE AQUATIC.  All of these films feel like colossal wastes of great casts.  I don't think there's been a good comedy since A FISH CALLED WANDA in 1988 (although parts of THE BIG LEBOWSKI are hilarious) so I don't think we have a good scale of reference when it comes to comedies.  Most stink.  Maybe the current generation of moviegoers have no idea what makes a great comedy.  That might explain the glowing reviews here.  Although Anderson's films are competently made, they feel stuffy and pretentious.  Humorless.  I chuckled once per hour.  Not a good average.  I don't think this movie ever makes up its mind.  And I'm so sick of Owen Wilson that I wish Hollywood would give him a paid vacation.  Does he have to be in every single movie ever made 
 I could not get into this book.  The storyline was dull and so were the characters.  Not recommended 
 "To Rescue a Rogue", Jo Beverly's Rogue finale, has a promising beginning, with Lady Mara St. Bride showing her spunk in extricating herself from a potentially ruinious situation and enlisting Lord Darius "Dare" Debenham's help.   He discretely cleans her up, and suddenly, she determines that she loves Dare  and always has.  Alas, he sees her in a sisterly way ... though her cleavage impresses him.  But wait! he loves her, too!  Melodramatic conflict arises in Dare's attempts to conquer his opium addiction and be worthy of her love, and how she pines for him.  Rather than her own strength of character, Mara attributes her legendary Black Ademar St. Bride hair as the explanation for her grit.  Meanwhile all the Rogues swirl around and Mara is suitably impressed.  Can they rescue Dare from Society's censure?  Will Mara and Dare ever marry?  Will Mara ever stop whining?  And what about her tonnish stalker who attempts to rescue Mara from Dare's overly public kiss?  Sadly, I found myself rooting for the stalker.  Beverly is an otherwise excellent writer, but with this one she fell short.  
 I listened to the unabridged version on tape.  I enjoy audio books because I'm able to work at the same time (I paint).  So I get to feed my desire for great fiction, and get my work done at the same time.    Blair Brown did an incredible job as a narrator. She was able to create a unique "voice" for each character in the story,making  it easy for the reader to keep track of all of the characters from the get go.  However, by the time I got to the end of the tape, I was glad that I at least had painted those six hours instead of wasting my time reading this novel!  I was so disappointed at the end, and found myself really irritated by the main character about three quarters of the way into the story. From the beginning of the story, I was irritated by the character's daughters too.  Also, I was irritated that nothing outwardly seemed to change in Rebecca's life.  OK, she had an arc, but it was all in her head. I found it very unfullfilling.  If I hadn't been passively listening to the story, while doing something else, I probably wouldn't have finished the novel 
 This book is very interesting- some of the "facts" in this book were unbelievable! It turns out they were just that- untrue, such as...   *If you fart consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough gas is produced to create the energy of an atomic bomb.  *Humans swallow an average of 8 spiders in their lifetime during their sleep.   *The avarage sneeze travels at 600 mph.    I could go on and on... my point is, this book is full of unresearched claims that the author passes on as facts. If you want a book completely full of bull***, get this piece of trash. If you want the facts, get a book that actually at least researches claims before publishing them 
 Basically took a bunch of great songs, dumbed them down, made them all sound the same, and made them very boring in the process. There's nothing unique about any of the songs, they are really boring covers you might expect to see some 18 year old freshman in college who is obsessed with Belle and Sebastian cover at a coffee shop. Boring, trite, nice effort but try again please.. I think the worst cover is the slaughter of Guns of Brixton. The Undertones cover on here is pretty bad, too... I don't know, I didn't fancy this. If you like boring yet somehow hip music, this may be your cup of tea. You should probably get the Garden State soundtrack too, that would be great for those boring days in your dorm or at the coffee shop with your soy vanilla latte... That was a bad shot at irony 
 i can't really review the movies because the transfers are so bad I CAN'T WATCH THE MOVIES!!!!!!!!! i'm no prude about transfers,i own many of those 50 pack movie sets and for the low price i know the quilty isn't going to be good,but you can't watch this set. don't waste your money find these movies in oyher better collection 
 This book presents itself as a "basic worldview catalog."  While it does cover many of the major themes it is heavily tainted by the authors inability to see things from anything but a Christian perspective.  A quote from the end of the book says it all in my mind: "In terms of possible worldviews, our options are numerous but, as we have seen, limited.  Of those we have investigated, all but theism were found to have serious flaws."  While no worldview is perfect, to not see the flaws in theism requires a very blinkered view of the world and this shows its self again and again through the book.  If you want to read something that tells you why Christianity is the best worldview there is - go ahead and buy it.  If you want something more objective I would look elsewhere.  
 Like most High Priests of Academia, Stephanie Pincetl gets it wrong. Either she's a shill for the Nationalist's Left Wing of Officialdom or simply she does not know how things work.  In true socialist-speak, Pincetl writes,          "...individuals have responsibilities to social whole..."  Pincetl confuses socialist liberalism (levelling based upon whims of mobs -- see: horrific French Revolution, 1789) with individualism (even the Lockean type).  Pincetl opposes all of the safeguards of Freedom Californians have against Elitist Officialdom:       1. requirement of 2/3's legislature to pass a fiscal year budget       2. private citizen participation in politics through private donation and support of candidates       3. special districts designed to "get work done", e.g., library districts, school districts, water districts  Pincetl even takes underhanded swipes at our beautiful ballot initiative safeguard against the Politics of Corruption (everyday politics in California and America).  Worse, Pincetl supports all of these evils of Socialist Elitist Officialdom:         1. forcing taxpayers to pay for elite politicos campaigns        2. subsidizing land-use owned by elites within one administrative boundary by stealing cash from the residents of another region       3. exponentially increasing theft of income using the rubric of "ability to pay"       4. elitist regional control of land-use but without any control by the great voters of California [a sure-fire way to allow corruption to decide who wins and who loses, but on a much larger scale].   Pincetl fails to see that "Progressive Era" was a nationalist movement to gain control of 1) local politics 2) California 3) replacing Jeffersonian statism with Roosevelt-Wilson-Roosevelt nationalism, a movement that used the rubric of "scietism enlightenment" to trick and deceive the good common man.  This is the kind of poison that you should keep away from yourself and your children.    Transforming Californi 
 We bought four sets of the Victoria Collection 600 thread count queen size.   The fitted sheets do not fit on our queen bed.  It seems like that were made for a full size not queen size... list this as a reject.  We are VERY VERY disappointed 
 I didn't get it.  The more I read, I got more frustrated.  
 I concur with another reviewer: get Luigi Gambero's "Mary and the Fathers of the Church," and, I might add, his follow-up work, "Mary in the Middle Ages."  Read these two books alongside "Truly Our Sister. . .," then decide whether 15 or 16 centuries of organic, historically contiguous development of the Church's Marian doctrine by some of the finest minds and hearts the Church has ever produced--including Bridget of Sweden, or Johnson's glib, 21st century, feminist revisionism provides the better spiritual nourishment.    The Blessed Virgin Mary stirs us to properly love her divine Son, bringing us into the intimate recesses of the Trinitarian love itself!  Anything shy of that simply misses the point and leaves one painfully short-changed.        
 the 2 bras i ordered were they same style, it even said so on the labels attached, however, they both look and feel different.  the white has a lot more padding, a rounder shape, and the lining is tearing away from the padding (part of the design).  The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what I wanted in the first place) I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition, I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered.  not happy with my overall experience 
 I wish I could give this Zero stars.  It is a very dark book and I can't imagine why anyone would write, publish, gift it, or read it.  There is so much good literature written why do we lower ourselves to this junk?  Garbage in garbage out!  
 Somehow this book ended up being a required text in my full-time MBA program.  We complained so much that this was a 1st year 'college level' book and not appropriate at our level that my school discontinued it the following year.  Now I can't resell my 'unused' version on campus.  What a waste 
 Sorry SleepMD - we are not impressed.  Not only did SleepMD not work for me - but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too.  Today we feel worse for the wear - and a bit ripped off.  No - I did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed. More like we were run over during the night. I wanted to inquire to the company in person - but can't find a website to do so.  So I plan to write. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  It's a waste of money 
 Despite a fair amount of attention given to this book in the popular press a few years ago, it is not a book for a general audience.  It reads like a long term paper, using terms like "symbolic capital" for "ideas", for example (although to be fair, this English version is a translation).   It is also out of date, since even though the publication date is 1985, most of it was written in 1970.   As for how well it covers the subject stated in the title, I was disappointed.   Many times in the text, Mernissi writes "I will now examine  (a topic)" yet at the end of the section, I didn't feel that she had.  Especially missing in my mind was information on what the "liberated" muslim women are saying about themselves, about being educated to the same level as men, and working outside of the home for wages.  Mernissi reports having had unstructured interviews with six such modern women, but except for listing their ages, marital status, and occupations in a table, never mentions them again.  These are women who were breaking new ground in male-female relations in 1970 but we don't get to hear what their experience was.   Instead we get a series of  basically philosophical discussions on the roles of women, men, and the heterosexual relationship in Morrocan Islamic society based on Islamic texts hundreds of years old.  This book is really for political science or religious studies majors only 
 I would not buy this version of the old classic for very young children.  In this version two of the pigs get eaten by the wolf, and the wolf gets eaten in the end by the last pig. When the pigs ask for the materials to  build their houses, they do not offer to pay, trade or work for the straw,  sticks or bricks, they are given the materials. What kind of message does  that give our youth 
 This book may be written about a fascinating literary figure at an interesting time in our history, with a potentially atmospheric setting and an intriguing mystery to boot--but it all adds up to nothing when the prose is so bad. I listened to about half this book on tape, but found I just could not bear another minute of it. It was stilted, repetitive, and trite. The language used in dialog and at moments of high drama was just plain embarrassing. Some suggest that the author was trying to emulate the way people spoke in the 19th c, but I don't believe anyone in history would've been this ponderous or repetitive in everyday speech; if so, such conversations are best forgotten.  I love mysteries and historical fiction, but have read boilerplate novels in these genres which are far less agonizing and more entertaining to read. 
 Edward Said tries to portray the Zionism from its victims' point of view. He arbitrarily asserts that the Palestinians are victims of the Zionism. He never considers that perhaps they are victims of their own fanaticism and uncompromising policy that are practiced for decades that brought them into their pitiful situation.   Another leitmotif in the book is the idea that Zionism is colonialism. He tries to sell the story of the colonizing Jews against the native Arabs, never mentioning any connection between the Jews and Israel, as though it is comparable to the white colonialists out of Europe. Also, through selective quoting, as he did in his famous previous book, Orientalism, he tries to show that the Israeli Zionists have scorned the Arabs. He boldly ignores many Zionists who admired the Arabs and saw them as the new man they are trying to create, and the antithesis of Jews of the Diaspora: proud person, who lives in his lands, defends it and farms it.   He also criticizes the Zionism because it is made for Jews and not Arabs. But Zionism is the Jewish nationalism, and there is no reason why it should promote the rights of the Arabs. Just like the Arab nationalism is not about Jewish rights.   The terrorism issue is another colossal failure of this book. He conveniently blames the victims: he asserts that the terrorism is forced upon the Palestinians, as though they have no choice. He tries to have it both ways, but it's impossible. You either condemn the terrorism, or justify it. You can't be both pro-Palestinian enough by avoiding a whole condemnation and in the meantime be liberal enough by condemning murders. There is no middle way.    The book is also full of other mistakes and distortions that come handy in telling his message: the Balfour declaration was considerate of the Palestinian rights, in contrary to his writing, and explicitly declares: "it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine". He also considers the Jewish resistance against the British as terrorism (although it was against military, not civilians) and suggests that the brave Egyptian peace with Israel harms the Palestinians, and that Saadat has made many concessions (in fact, he did got all the territory that Egypt loss, except for Gaza strip which he didn't want).   The few good things that have to be said on the book are that its conciseness and fluency make it an easy read, and that his points that the Palestinian people exists and that their right to self determination must be fulfilled are precisely right. 
   I can't agree with . Shih "M.Smith"'s review even more. I just can't stand the arrogance tone shown in this book. I got a feeling that the authors simply don't like the progress in China. It seems like the authors are simply trying to minimizing the progress China made and relishing the problems China has.   I seriously doubt the authors ever read any Chinese sources or talk to any Chinese scholar. The authors seem to imply that if the Chinese to follow the American way, then they will never succeed. True, China has a tons of problems. But the Chinese leaders and Chinese people are trying their best to solve them. What annoys me is that some of these authors seem to relish over the fact that China has so many problems  You won't get that much new info about China in this book. Yea, China has tons of problems. Who doesn't know. The authors are trying to answer the most complex questions of China with simplistic answers. 
 Good if you have lots of time to kill, because it has some pages devoted to useless information such as the stupid poem on page 1022 that has  nothing to do with accounting. It appears the authors placed lots of  "real world" trivia that is boring and useless. Entire page of  964 talks about the reason why Coca-Cola will not do business with Lakers  because they signed Pepsi spokeman Shaq O'Neill, it has nothing to do with  the subject but  the extra pages makes you think you got something for the  high priced book. If you absolutely need this book, go borrow it from your  public library and save your money.The book manuscript was NEVER approved  by a CPA or business owner but a long list of college instructors. It does  cover all the basics 
 Bonavoglia examines the modern Catholic Church and women that are making great strides to change the woman's role in the church.  This book highlights a number of different women and the actions they have taken in an attempt to influence the Church's hierarchy to be more inclusive and accepting of women in significant Church roles.  It also emphasizes the multitude of examples where women have been blatently excluded and discouraged, if not prevented, from taking a more active role in the Church.  Topics addressed include the Church's position and reaction to pedophilia, rape, contraceptives, abortion, sex, and women's ordination.  What had potential to be a stirring and thought provoking book turned into a chore to read.  I found the writing to be disjointed and personal stories slammed into the middle of some fact and some author opinion.  What this book was able to do was highlight some of the actions of the Church that are truly disappointing revelations in today's modern age.  However, the impact of these revelations was lost in the boring writing surrounding them.  The epilogue is the only part of the book that really flows and stirs some emotion.  But for the last two pages of the book I would have rated it with 1 star only 
 Was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting, indepth coverage, etc.  Then, starting about 1-2 years ago, the magazine started to take a "left" tilt.  (I do not consider myself "right wing", am registered as an independant, but do like fair balanced coverage in my news)  Since the beginning of this decline, the Atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine.  The bias has also led, as it always does, to less in-depth reporting, since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent. 
 "Internal Combustion" by Edwin Black is an entertaining but uneven history about the control of energy with a purported emphasis on the ascendancy of the gasoline-powered automobile. To his credit, Mr. Black has managed a substantive research project that has uncovered a great deal of arcane historic information about the automotive industry. Unfortunately, this preachy book suffers from an acute lack of focus, where it is suspected that the large amounts of extraneous background material was added in an attempt to obscure the book's shortcomings. Indeed, the author ultimately fails to prove his central thesis, thereby casting doubt about the validity of both his research and his conclusions.  Mr. Black opens the book with a scene depicting the burning of Thomas Edison's research laboratories in December, 1914. Mr. Black's conspiracy theory proposes that sinister forces aligned with the gasoline-burning automotive industry may have intentionally destroyed the world's one and only hope to mass-produce an electric car. Unfortunately, Mr. Black provides no evidence to prove this allegation.    Mr. Black attempts to buttress his case by explaining that electric vehicles were once utilized as taxis in New York and other major cities in the late nineteenth century and, therefore, could have and should have been mass marketed to an appreciative public. We are supposed to accept Mr. Black's thesis that success would have been an inevitable and logical outcome despite the severe weight, cost and range limitations of the electric car when compared with the gasoline automobile. In fact, while Thomas Edison and Henry Ford were still tinkering with an electric alternative a full thirteen years after gasoline-powered vehicles had already been in mass production, it is evident to the reader that internal combustion vehicles prevailed because they were affordable, the first to market and could traverse longer distances than electric cars. That all of this was not a good development for people's health and the environment is not in dispute; rather, it is Mr. Black's contention that the white-hatted purveyors of electric vehicles could have prevailed save for the obstructionism of the black-hatted petroleum industry that remains in question.    In the end, what is conspicuously lacking throughout the book is a credible attempt at analyzing and critiquing the history of governmental and popular struggle with the fossil-fuel industry. But instead of scholarship, we have a vainglorious author who is determined to salvage the barren results of two years' worth of study by substituting analysis with a highly questionable work of narrative. The end result is little more than a masquerade of nonfiction; at best, it is a book that might have limited appeal to readers who crave pseudo-historicism at the expense of intellectual rigor, consistency, insight or coherence. 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 ...and adversely affect the posture of students because of heavy book bags.   To describe this book in a phrase: "Information Overload".   This book takes one sub topic and delivers, at most, around one and a half pages of information packed dialog.  It's these kinds of textbooks that are filled with wordy dialog that make me want to puke.   It's easy to fall asleep reading this book or become depressed.  This book promises more than it can deliver, namely "...to know-and love-history..."  What we need is a new positive, yet productive, attitude towards understanding our history.  It's hard to love "our" history after reading of the horrors that whites inflicted on African-Americans and Native Americans.   ....Is there any reason that American students are behind? Try reading their books, try hauling their book bag across campus and putting up with their slacker teachers(who,spare a few, demand more and deliver less). There are a few good teachers out there but they find themselves moving up to administrative positions and out of the classroom where they're needed.  -Buc 
 George Page is a journalist, not a researcher. Unfortunately, that does not save him from taking the posture of one who knows better. He dismisses whole fields of discourse with offhand remarks, for example: "Eventually behaviorism melded with the equally notorious sociobiology as formulated by E. O. Wilson." (p. 29) For an accessible yet scholarly exploration of animal cognition, I recommend Marc Hauser's "Wild Minds." Hauser is a scientist, who specializes in primate cognition. His writing is more lucid, and less affected. He addresses the same questions as Page, with an appreciation for subtle variaritions in the possible interpretations of evidence, which is lacking in Page's presentation. One comparison between the books: Page's bibliography is 3 pages long; Hauser's spans 30 
 I bought this book after see the movie as a child still great loved every minute of it 
 I have owned many radios and purchased this received short wave stations and to get better reception for local stations.  This radio did neither. This radio performed worse than a $10 cheapy radio which received station more easily and much clearer.  I returned this radio shortly after trying it. What a waste! Do not buy this piece of junk 
 I've been a subscriber to this for over 10 years and I've loved getting this, but it has undergone changes recently and NOT for the better. Specifically, I hate what they've done to the graphical design inside. Whereas they used to employ several different styles when it came to things like fonts and artwork for whatever subject was written about, now they've adopted a uniform style where nearly EVERYTHING looks the same. It looked better BEFORE. The writing isn't as witty or sharp (have longtime staff departed?), and there are "filler" pieces in the form of moronic sidebars and boxes - useless attempts at humor that simply don't work. The strength of the magazine continues to come from the critics, especially the movie and dvd section. Sadly, typically, when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like I'm going to have to consider letting my sub expire 'cos I don't let my mailbox fill with crap like this 
 I was a little disappointed. There were a few tidbits that I liked but other than that, nothing I didn't know. Kind of a "preaching to the choir" kind of book in my opinion. 
 First I will say that JAK was not previously on my must buy list and judging from this book she will not be there any time in the near future.  For me, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting and at many times annoying.  I didn't even like the dog and I have now been informed over and over that jogging will ruin my knees.  The mystery part of the book seemed almost like it was thrown in as a second thought and made absolutely no sense.  I thoroughly enjoy a well-developed romantic mystery but this is certainly not one.  I might give JAK another chance sometime but hopefully I have helped save someone's time with this title. 
 Well, I was excited to see that this book held my attention for the first 80 pages.  Then thumbing to the back I noticed a couple pages at the end of the book selling devil worship.  These books are authored by the person that gives the forward to The Mastery of Life.    At that point I realized that this book was not for me and I gave it away.  I can't base my life and decisions on where the moon is or what day of the week it is.  It might work for some, especially since Satan has been given certian powers, but I refuse to go to him for security in my life.  I know that he will always let you down in the end, and there is only One that can defeat all enemies for you in the long run.  This is my personal decision and feel that others that make a different decision in their life have the right to do so, and I don't degrade them in any way.  I support their right to choose 
 I'm a fundamentalist Christian who loathes this book. I'm about as theologically conservative a person as you're ever likely to find. So why do I hate this book so much?  Well, for one thing, it encourages people to chase after things after God says no. This woman waited for five years for a man who said that she was kind of attractive (to her face!) even after her family and HIS family told her to let it go. God opens the doors he wants opened. She kept pounding away until she got HER will done.  The most important thing, however, is that this book is intensely religious. Religion is antithetical to the spirit of Christ. It is, in fact, demonic.   So why does Elisabeth encourage us to follow her example exactly? Why does she intimate that it's wrong for a person to touch his beloved's cheek? Is God not dynamic? Are His mercies not new every morning? Does he want us to act exactly like someone else? Does he want us to be deprived of the glorious liberty that exists within obedience? I'm just sayin'. 
 I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans 
 I read Exile all in the space of a 24-hour train ride from NYC to Chicago (via DC) on New Year's Day, and was left thoroughly unsatisfied and bored by it.  While Mark's wanderings from the East Village to Portland were sort  of familiar to me, and his less-than-heroic sexual escapades seemed  honestly told, there is little sense of perspective or meaning in the  novel.  The novel documents the minutia of the day-to-day life of a writer  of bad poetry, his sexual indiscretions and the people who he purposely and  inadvertantly hurts along his path.  It was like reading journal entries  which document a particularly uninteresting period of someone's life.   Really annoying, also, was the tacked-on now-he'll-see-the-light ending,  which took all of ten or fifteen pages and brought absolutely no closure to  the plot.  A lot of books like this have popped up recently; novels that  don't seem to have much to say or much of a plot, but which kind of string  you along with the promise that there could be something underneath all the  meandering jive; finally when you finish, you feel stupid for having wasted  all that time on characters you don't care about and a plot that has taken  you nowhere 
 I bought this book on the basis of a National Public Radio story which promoted it in an in-depth study of the devestating 1900 hurricane that killed thousands in Galveston, Texas. The radio spot spared no expense with the sound of hurricane force wind surrounding the historic taped voices of survivors describing a night where death pounded on the door. It made a much better radio show than it does a book. The problem is, the eyewitnes accounts are all in cloudy retrospect, some were taped seventy-plus years afterwords and are shaky historic accuracy. The book is a compilation of various communications from victims and survivors; personal letters, weather reports, diary entries, newspaper headlines and the mighty storm soon becomes as redundant as a 'Weather Channel' report. If the authors had found a grocery list of a victim, it would be included. Surely this hurricane which killed over 5000 people in an American coastal community in 1900 was more horrific than the drab, hearsay accounts given here. There is no journalistic quality. Even the photographs show page after page of what appears to be the same pile of wooden rubble 
 Not a single screw, bolt, allan wrench, etc. enclosed with this desk.  The wood looked nice but getting it back into the box to return was like unscrambling an egg.  Hopefully UPS will pick it up although I've been waiting for more than a day now.  Amazon is paying for the return and that's a good thing 
 Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually HURTS to watch it. From the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters (odd, considering that in interviews after the first movie, all of them said they'd want/ be willing to come back for a sequel), to the horrible (even by 1997 standards) CG effects, to the cliched fight scenes (gee...two women in a mud pit.  I bet it took them all night to come up with that one), virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie DID go wrong with this movie. Loosely based on the story of the Mortal Kombat 3 video game (and set immediately after the first movie, which, while not great, looks like Citizen Kane compared to this stinkburger), the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting Shao Khan (played by Brian Thompson, the alien bounty hunter from The X-Files) and his army (shown in most scenes as a small band of extras.  Oooh...scary.) as they attempt to take over Earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as Outworld.  This merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity. With only a week to do anything about it, Lord Raiden (played by James Remar, replacing the, and I can't believe I'm saying this, much better Christopher Lambert in the role) once again enlists the help of Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Sonia Blade (Sandra Hess), and Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto), along with help from a select few other characters from the video games' crowded lineup, to prevent this from happening. The story in and of itself is not necessarily bad.  However, given the film's obviously low budget the weak screenplay, the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film, and most jarringly, direction even more inept than that of Paul W.S. Anderson, it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high, only to have practically everything come crashing down. The only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack, featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie, as well as music by KMFDM, Megadeth, Rammstein, Juno Reactor, and others. If ever you're looking to punish yourself for something, then by all means watch this movie.  However, if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself, you will avoid this movie like the plague.  Believe me, you'll thank yourself later. 
 I had to read Wise Children for my A-level English lit class. I'm not fond of this book to say the least and it pains me to think I have to reread it sometime soon. It's unnecessarily filled with incestuous relationships written in the most dire and ponderous narrative possible from the view of a 75 year old woman reminiscing her long gone heydays.  Carter's language has the potential in creating something of a worthy read but the structure and content of the novel diminish and incinerate every possibilty. As if the narrative isn't dire as it is, the chronology of events are manipulated and Dora digresses a great deal. We're soon left wondering What The Hell Is Going On? and need to re-read the same paragraph to grasp hold of the labrynth like links between each events.  This book lacks in a plot with any substance and ends exactly how it started. What a waste of time. 
 I simply do not see any point in mixing Crime Fiction with Crime and Punishment.   
 I DIDN'T ORDER THE BOOK AFTER READING THE REVIEWS AND THE TABLE OF CONTENTS AS I AM AN AVID READER OF ROY WILLIAMS WORKS. IF YOU READ HIS BOOKS HE MENTIONS "A LITTLE BIT" ABOUT HOW TO USE PRINT; HOWEVER, HIS PRIMARY FOCUS, IN MY OPINION, IS HOW TO USE THE POWER OF SOUND IN BROADCAST ADVERTISING. THE QUICKEST WAY INTO THE CUSTOMER'S MIND IS THROUGH THE EAR AND BROCA. I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD FIND THAT IN HOW TO WRITE BROCHURES, HEADLINES, ETC 
 This DVD is terrible!  All the songs are from the Buena Vista Social Club but are butchered.  The musicians are constantly missing notes, they bring on "special" guests who can barely play their instruments.  Save yourself the expense or at least rent this botched effort before you buy it.  
 First Bill has never nor will he ever be a jazz musician. It seems that those who branch out and play multiple styles are often lauded for expanding the vocabulary. Here's what chaps my hide the most. Bill has somehow captured the attention of hordes of budding guitarist with their effect pedals all strung out as if they were getting ready for a space shuttle launch. It burns me too no end when a person calls himself a "jazz" guitarist, but doesn't really have any chops. I know Bill has been called anti-technique, but what does that really mean? Would you want a heart transplant performed by a surgeon that means well, but really isn't very good at what he/she does? This guy is getting built up as something new and it seems every time I turn around someone that knows absolutely nothing about jazz guitar is throwing this guy in my face. I've been a professional jazz guitarist for 12 years and teaching for 8 years. When I have guys that actually debate me that Bill is somehow doing more interesting things than say Pat Martino, or that Bill could somehow hang in a jam session with someone like Pat Martino, I have to shake my head in disbelief in how twisted and mixed up this world has become when charlatans are giving more credit than someone like Pat who has been on the road for years and paid dues that Frisell couldn't imagine. Is Bill Frisell a Jazz musician, No! Maybe if the guy could woodshed for a dozen years he'd come up with something. For me I'll stick with the guys that really know how to play......Johnny Smith, Peter Leitch, Jim Hall, Pat Martino, Kenny Burrell, Billy Bauer, Tal Farlow, Lenny Breau, Jimmy Bruno, Jimmy Raney, Wes Montgomery and so on 
 This is the first time I have written a review.  In this particular case, I felt it was my responsibility to forewarn potential readers of the disturbing contents of this book.  I've read several "self help" books on subjects ranging from introversion to optimistic thinking.  I found this book to be of little help and quite disturbing.  The book is filled with tests and self evaluations.  I do not believe it is necessary to know where one falls on the optimist/pessimist scale.  Often, such tests can only further depress or make anxious an already vulnerable reader.  In Chapter 5, the author uses an extremely horrific and disturbing story to illustrate a five step process to forgiveness.  I was further sickened by the author's list of "bodily pleasures" in Chapter 7.  Rather than feeling uplifted by this book, I found myself feeling upset and outraged by the author's egotism, ignorance, perversion and insensitivity.  I caution anyone seeking advice on optimism 
 My first Nora Roberts' book....with only be persistent did I complete the book....found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline...shallow characterizatio 
 This more I think about this book, the more thought provoking it becomes.  First, I find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that's widely known (practically a cliche), add nothing of substance to it, and actually write a book about it.  Second, I find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the Golden Rule applicable to business.  Third, and perhaps the most amazing of all, is the fact that I actually spent my own hard earned money on this book.  What amazing insights did I think would be uncovered?  I'll save you $9.72 (+s/h) and the 45 minutes it'll take you to read this.  Here goes... Unless you were raised by wolves, it's pretty likely you've heard of the Golden Rule.  Ok, now think about how this rule can be applied to all of your business dealings.  That's it - you got it!    Whew!  Now that you have an extra $9.72 in your pocket and 45 minutes of free time, go practice that Golden Rule by treating your kids/grandkids/neighbors to some ice cream 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 I was looking forward to hearing this CD after everything I had read and heard about the production, but I found it a major disappointment. The premise of a fusty old show queen liking a show this bad just didn't work for me. The songs are more TV jingle-like than anything that recalls music from the Roaring '20s. I gave up trying to wade through the synopsis to figure out why Sutton Foster is singing that dull--and LONG!--song about the monkey. Cute is not a substitute for witty--the writers of this show must not know that. Don't waste your money on this one 
 Read the Unbox terms of use CAREFULLY before choosing this route over a regular DVD purchase.  It is not your usual set of "blah blah" legal jargon.  For example, 3c: "Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you."  If you ever remove the Unbox software, Amazon may revoke your ability to view the Firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine!  Amazon, I've ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience; why did you let Unbox create these anti-customer terms of use?? 
 This book contains a gross error of an incident about me that was widely, and accurately, covered by other media, most notably the Washington Post and Columbia Journalism Review. (See "Blasting the Boss in Boston", Stephen J. Simurda, Columbia Journalism Review, September 2000.) I contacted McChesney when I discovered it; he apologized and said he would correct it in any future editions of this book. There have, however, been no future editions and it would be good of him to uphold the journalistic responsibility about which he so passionately preaches by providing an insert to any copies sold. I have no knowledge that he has done so. Readers should therefore be forewarned of the scholarly deficiency of this work 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 Imagine asking a lawyer to read your favorite news story from the past 50 years and comment on it.  They'd complain about the "lack of accuracy" or the contradictory reporting (when someone got both sides of a story).  This is what Bart Ehrman did with "Misquoting Jesus."    I was interested in this book because I had read other reports about the accuracy of the New Testament.  Many scholars said that this was the most well documented historical event in the ancient history of mankind.  However, Ehrman provides excruciating analysis of about 30 phrases and then implies that our creator should have done a better job of inspiring those first century authors if he expected us to believe them.  For example, he berates early Christians for their anti-Jewish sentiments (primarily in Acts and the epistles) as if this was typical anti-semitism in the early church.  He forgets that prior to those events, Jews rejected and ultimately persecuted early Christians, going to the point of including a curse against all heretics in their temple services.  Unfortunatley, the one sided criticism is routine in this book and makes it hard to believe that the author is being objective.  In another case, he goes to great length to say that errors could have crept into one of Paul's epistles, even though he signed the document at the bottom.  Even today, someone is expected to read and correct a document that they sign.  Apparently that's too advanced a concept for Paul of Tarsus.  Additionally, he claims that Paul "dictated" the epistle to scribes when there is a perfectly plausible alternative.  We know that Paul actually wrote many letters.  However, we also know that many of the letters he wrote are copies that he appended sayings to to show his authorization for the work.  Ehrman ignores the possibility that Paul could actually have written the epistle in question and simply had others copy the written text verbatim.  Instead, he relies on the idea that the epistle was actually "dictated" as John did with his gospel.  That's one of the explanations he uses for the POSSIBILITY that errors crept into the text.  This kind of myopia is a greasy film that covers the otherwise scholarly research in his book.  Unfortunately, if he looked at all the plausible alternatives for the possible errors, his book would have to be renamed "Possible minor inaccuracies in the greatest book ever written."  You can imagine what that might have done to book sales 
 I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.   While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.   He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them. 
 Shiseido is known for creating top quality products that do not irritate even the most sensitive of skin. My mother and many of my friends mothers swear by their Benefiance line.  I cannot tell you how disappointed I am in their Pureness line. It is for oily/problem skin.  I have been using this for about 10 days and while it goes on nicely and has this wonderful, light, clean fragrance, it had made my skin even oilier.  I thought my skin just had to get acclimated to a new skincare regimen but this is not the case 
 I've bought a number of Oxo kitchen accessories, and found them to be sturdy, remarkably well designed, and easy to use.  Unfortunately, this timer is an exception.  It has the usual features typical of timers at this price point: clock plus timer, ten number keys for input, memory, etc. But instead of being flat with a magnet on the back so it can fall off the refrigerator like other timers, it's round like a traditional wind-up kitchen timer. It's solid-feeling and has nice non-skid feet on the bottom.  The problem is the display. It's horrible. For three reasons:  First, the numbers are small -- smaller than any other timer I've seen. They're about 1/4" high, half or less the size of those on comparable timers.  Second, the numbers are recessed 1/8" or more beneath a clear plastic cover, not on the surface -- it's dark in there and feels like looking down a well. It desperately needs a backlight, but there is none. Unless the light source is shining directly into the display, there's a large dark shadow covering part of the numbers. But that causes the third problem:  The clear plastic cover over the numbers is both curved and highly reflective, and it's virtually impossible to arrange things so that there isn't a reflection shining back into your eyes .  The bottom line is that I have to fiddle around to get the timer, the light source, and myself into a position where I can read the small, dark, shadowed, and reflective display. Not what I need when I'm trying to cook.  It's just not worth it. Since I have several other timers with displays I don't have to strain to read, I use this one as a paperweight. I'd have to say it works very well.  I just don't understand how Oxo managed to let such a flawed design out the door 
 Not that good, simply put. The first three songs are all great, as well as "Satellites and Astronauts", but almost everything else is rather bland. "Swim" employs an obsolete '80s riff on the verses, a vibe that unwelcomely pops up throughout this disc, even in the chorus after the mighty verse riff on "Pinball Map".  This CD is okay, but it just pales to compare to the overpowering songwriting and intricacies of The Jester Race and Soundtrack To Your Escape 
 Stale, painfully obvious information from the so-called internet gurus. Full of "what-to-do" instead of the more useful "how-to-do" information. If you really must get this type of info, go to the authors' websites. It's just get rich on the internet by telling others how to get rich on the internet. For beginners in ecommerce, there's very little in the way of detailed step-by-step instructions. For people with more experience, there's nothing new here, just a compilation of articles with the author's website address at the end of each one where you can actually buy the information they're telling you about 
 I listen to Enya's music and all I feel is this empty sadness...that's what Enya's music IS sad music with plain arrangements, mechanical choir(s), and mostly lame melodies.  I like a few of the songs on this album.  "Hope Has A Place" is kindof a highlighted song I hope to use in a movie I'm writing a script for.  "Tea House Moon" is OK; kinda sleepy-sounding, though.  "The Memory of Trees" opens with a promising group of melodies, then gets caught up in finishing too quickly or SOMETHING that causes the song to fall short of its intentions...I can't even remember anything else that I really like off of this album or almost really like.  And, like any Enya album, this one has at least one really dark midevil sounding song.  Perhaps the only reason people like Enya is b/c she's a more gentle sounding artist, as opposed to guitar-clanging janglers like Sheryl Crow and Alanis Morissette, who seem to be liked by the same crowd 
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 As an introduction Zen, what has been presented in this book is fine though it could have been done with lot less elitist overtone. I agree Zen and its true comprehension does not come easy (I am talking of regular mortals such as myself here) and words as mere symbols for concepts are distorting when conveying Zen.   I do not propose that I am an expert on Zen or even Buddhism in general but I have read a few books on Buddhism by Thich Nhat Hanh, Dalai Lama, Chogyam Trungpa and others. Though an agnostic who does not care for much for organized religion, I do believe the most fundamental benefit of any spiritual/ religious framework is to instill a sense of compassion toward other beings. You need some kind of cultural creation (religious or otherwise) to counter act the natural tendency of a human to be self-serving. In this aspect, I have high regards for non-theistic Buddhism and the inclusiveness of Vedanta (Hinduism) that proposes all religions eventually lead to the same attainment. From this viewpoint I was surprised with this author.  This author may have been one of the leading authorities on Zen in his time, but unfortunately he comes as an arrogant, elitist, full of prejudices. He does not miss any opportunity to put down other religions or even other sects of Buddhism. Only Zen as practiced by the Rinzai sect is pure, strong and generally worthy of pursuit. Any form of spiritualism from the West is of course hopeless since the western mind cannot escape the conditioning of logical thinking.  Any spiritualism from India is complex, ceremonial and not practical. Other sects of Buddhism generally do not have true comprehension, lost their way focusing on non-essentials etc. He reserves his most disparaging remarks for Indian religions and monks (and does his best to show that though Buddhism originated in India, it is really the Chinese and Japanese due to their practical nature made something of it).  Is this just the standard fundamentalism/ misplaced racism?  I will definitely read other books on Zen and go beyond this author. 
  It's the polar opposite of good writing.  It's so familiar, so conversational, so unturgid, and so padded with fluffy stuff it's unreadable.  Even worse than I figured it would be.  Oh, well, now i know after wondering all these years. 
 Peter Chalers Hoffer announces in the preface that he will spend the second half of his book discussing the misconduct of four renowned historians (Michael Bellesiles, Joseph Ellis, Stephen Ambrose, and Doris Kearns Goodwin).  By examining their cases, he hopes to explain "how the history profession has fallen into disarray and controversy."  Hoffer undercuts his own stated intent by largely excusing the plagiarism of Doris Kearns Goodwin. Kearns, Hoffer says, made mistakes only "inadvertently and infrequently and when confronted with them tried to repair the damage. . . ." This conclusion is only half accurate.  Although Kearns admitted and promised to correct her mistakes, the Los Angeles Times uncovered dozens of examples of copying in her Pulitizer Prize-winning book No Ordinary Time. One or two instances of plagiarism would arguably constitute "inadvertent" and "infrequent" copying; dozens of cases reveal a deliberate pattern.  If as Hoffer contends Kearns essentially did nothing wrong,  once must wonder why he included her in a volume about misconduct.  Of course, Kearns did commit academic fraud. If Hoffer wishes to expose and correct the disarray that (supposedly) currently plagues the historical profession, he should hold Kearns to the same high standard that he does Stephen Ambrose, the other notorious plagiarist in this volume 
 I've loved this movie ever since I saw it on CBS years ago so I was really excited to own it on DVD. Unfortunately the experience was ruined when I discovered that there are big sound problems on the second disc. Loud popping sounds completely cover up the dialogue in an entire scene. I was very dissapointed.   The movie is great but the sound problems aren't worth the purchase. Stay away 
 This is the first review i've written and I just wanted to let people know that this in essence is a  good book....but only if your looking for drugs/medications as a priority to dealing with your hormonal problems. I ordered this book along with another book called "hormonal balance" and there's no comparing between the two. The other book talks indepth about exactly what your hormones do...and how they control your body. This book gives a short explanation followed by prescriptions that your doctor might advise...it has alternative treatments...but they are not very detailed...and focus more on "get more sleep....exercise....etc". All in all it's not a bad book...but there are definetly better one's out there 
 Great price for this audio collection but i think the delivery did not quite do it for me. You also get the feeling you have heard it all before. Also the material does not sound original enough even though mr hopkins is an accomplished salesperson 
 I looked forward to reading this book after so many good reviews. But.. I'm not sure, if this book is meant for pregnant women, mostly, I believe, for midwives, cause it describes story of midwifery in US. Besides, it contains some not happy ending stories, which sounded really scary to me (dead babies, severe brain damaged babies..) I hate reading this stuff while I'm pregnant. I wasn't scared so much until I read this book. I don't recommend it for preggies! 
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 Though the illustrations are cute and the content is fine, these othersized and lightweight flaps rip VERY easily.  We've not even had them 1 month and the book is in poor condition from regular use that other flap books do fine. Cannot recommend this one! We are very disappointed 
 I don't mind using bisquick or jiffy mixes but packaged soup mixes and canned soup have so much sodium.  I'd have preferred to see use of fresh ingredients, they don't take long to prepare 
 this book did not define any good portrayal of anything. it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about $30.00!!!! THAT IS REDICULOUS.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS A F 
 What a disapointment! the book is not at all sufficient to operate small repair on leicas. it assumes too much knowledge and lacks step by step explanations and diagrams. I have found much more usefull dismantle description and repair instructions for free on the web. moreover, the subject treated are not systematic at all. restoration is treated on one camera, speed tuning on another. most of the pictures are useless as they descibe dismantle stages without showing the parts been discribed in the text for better clarity. This book is the output of someone who apparently is a good repairman but completely lacks any comunication skills 
 If you read the outside cover of the CD Audiobook, you get the impression that the volume strongly will deal with the manner in which FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt led the country during World War II.  However, what you get is more often innuendo about FDR's fascination with women other than his wife, whether his prviate secretaries, a visiting princess, or his mistress of many years.  Eleanor is covered in more detail than was expected, but she comes off pretty well, her husband's wandering eye notwithstanding.  Goodwin does provide some insight into the challenges of running the United States during the critical war years, but the amount of time devoted to private pursuits was not what was expected.  I had hoped for a lot more detail on the warimte effects of the economy, and the challenges it served the president.  I had hopes of more on FDR's handling of race and labor issues, but did not get it.  I had hopes of learning more about FDR's partnership with the Congress to achieve the nation's goals, but was disappointed there as well.  This was the first Goodwin book I picked up, and it didn't put me off enough to avoid her amazingly good Team of Rivals, about Lincoln and his cabinet.  Still, I remain disappointed that the book's cover and inside clearly focused on other issues than what was projected 
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
 The majority of interviews are with performers and bands that established themselves in the 1990's. More importantly, the majority of interviews are with bands that were already circling the perimeter of corporate-sponsored "indie-rock". With the exception of Jello Biafro were never given any real insight into the workings of truly underground, hardcore political punk. Where were the interviews with MDC, Nausea, Toxic Reasons, Youth Brigade, Lydia Lunch, Foetus, Filth, Gangrene, the Squat or Rot crowd etc.? Daniel Sinker does a good job covering middle-class University-friendly phenomenona like the Riiot Grrl movement - but does little in the way of real research. Sinker missed the boat by about a decade and what we're given is his interpretation of what "punk rock" is 
 If I could give this book zero stars, I would do so. There's barely a plot: the protagonist, Janie, marries three men and kills the last one because he gets rabies. The end. Janie is the ultimate antiheroin. She comes off as this oppressed little wife who takes forever to speak out against her husbands. It would have been better if Alice Walker had not "found" Zora Hurston and brought this awful book back into the public. 
 What started out as a pleasant experience became a bit of a let down. The foreword by Charlie Papazian gets you all geared up. The book reads well although some of the tips are questionable. The book is definitely more for the extract brewer. Some recipes look interesting and some are out there. However comments that are degrading or offensive to certain people should have been omitted. This is supposed to be a reference book not a soapbox. Overall I found Designing Great Beer (Daniels) much more useful 
 I read all 12 of these things. Armageddon has it's moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking. Nicolae and Leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil.. Nicolae acts more like a spoiled 11 yr old with the world's arsenal then the antichrist.  And Leon (was a buffoon and lacky) rather then "the False Prophet")   People either love or hate this series.. I for one do buy into the Dogma the series teaches. It is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs I hold dear. 
 This book has some heartbreakingly beautiful photos and I love the title, but watch out, especially if you're buying a gift for a sensitive dog lover.  There is a page where a yard-dog, the kind who lives his life chained outside, is wondering why he's always chained up.  It is too painful for a lot of people to see this 
 The dust jacket of this book boasts that it is "the first comprehensive photographic record of the bombings". However, its idea of comprehensiveness - while finding room for a film poster of the 1952 Robert Taylor movie "Above and Beyond" - does not include *a single one* of the tens of thousands of corpses littering the ground of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   That's right. As far as the 500+ photographs in this "objective, informative volume" [quoting the dust jacket again] are concerned, our two atomic bombs - while producing a lot of rubble and five mild burn victims - did not cause a single fatality.   The chief author of this book is identified as "a retired U.S. Air Force officer". Make of this what you like 
 This is a cursory introduction to gambling and I've very skeptical about it making anyone a lot of money. Yes, David Sklansky is a great man, but no, this is not a great work. I agree that it is rather shallow and an illustration of a little bit of knowledge being dangerous (which is what it provides readers with as opposed to the knowledge of Sklansky and Malmuth which is quite deep). Anybody dumb enough to pursue a career in sports or horse handicapping after reading it is in serious trouble. The first fifth of the book is devoted to blackjack but I don't think it has much application to the current state of the game as the six to eight deck shoes are very hard on counters and the continuous reshuffle machines will leave anybody relying on blackjack to pay their bills destined to an address in debtor's prison (lol). With the poker section, there are about a million sources better than this one and I would hope that prospective gamblers read them carefully before embarking upon careers as professionals. Dated and superficial is a good way to describe this book and I wouldn't bother with it personally. I'm not surprised that they plug so many of their 2+2 books in these pages because they're all superior to this one. 
 I bought this book based on its description, thinking it would be a great little story about accepting people's differences.  However, after a couple of times through, I gave up trying to put a favorable spin on it for my little girl.  While it is a fairly entertaining little story, it is marred for us by the message that David's father is acceptable because he is so big and frightening that he scares people into giving the children what they want. David's father is cool because he's a bully?  It seems to me we already have too many "might makes right" stories 
 This book totally sucks. The book uses very confusing and not to the point language. Instead of learning, one gets lost in the text. Do not buy this piece of junk!! 
 The author makes a lot of clear statements about what is acidifying and what is alkalizing.  However, some of what he says is the exact opposite of other sources of information I've found.  Unlike the other sources, Vasey never ever (as far as I could tell) explained how he knew what he said was true.  He never mentioned doing any testing on the foods (as far as I could tell).  He never mentioned any sources of his information.  We are just suppose to assume he is a font of all wisdom on this subject for no reason that I could understand.  I believe it was Bertrand Russell who said that insight untested is no guarantee of the truth.  As he never explained his source of knowledge on this, I don't trust him 
 This is the worst book I have ever read.  The entire book is filled with made up statistics and made up people, giving made up quotes.  The author was not subjective at all in her research and is extremely biased towards men!  I think that this author had some serious self issues while writing this book!  I would never recommend anyone to read this garbage!  The author basically spents the entire time, telling how women always forced to starve themselves to get anywhere in this society, which is far from true!  And then places the blame on men for the women that do starve themselves, and then insists that men are very subjected to the pressures of society!  To prove this point tell me that last time that a male was in the medai, that has body hair on his entire body!!!  DON"T READ THIS BOOK 
 Until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave-ins:  It made my dry, curly hair soft, shiny, and smelling great!  But lately something has changed. The once thick, silky liquid has turned thin and watery, with a distinctly alcohol-like smell.  It's so disappointing... this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book.  Don't bother with it anymore, unless the original formula comes back 
 The paper used to print this worthless screed was wasted. This is a typical geographical put down based on regional stereotyping. Drufresne assumes everyone in a given location is totally ignorant and comical. What an insult! How did this manuscript ever get accepted for publication 
      In his most recent attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the Da Vinci Code, Bart Ehrman presents Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene.  Most of the Amazon reviewers of the book seem unaware that the book is a skillfully disguised anti-Christian polemic--in the Tubingen tradition--which is based upon a number of historically and philosophically flawed assumptions.  I mention this at the outset because so many reviewers continue to praise Ehrman for his objective historical scholarship and lack of theological bias.  This is laughable.  He is about as theologically unbiased as John Gager, Elaine Pagels, and the other post-Protestant, anti-Christians of the PTS.       In this book, Ehrman very craftily juxtaposes a number of late second century Gnostical texts with passages from the Acts of the Apostles in an attempt to convince people that the Acts were fictional, legendary accounts of Peter and Paul, devised for theological purposes by non-witnesses of the late first or early second century.  This Tubingen theory has been thoroughly debunked for years.  Can Ehrman please explain to his agnostical cheerleaders why the historical data in the Acts ends abruptly in 62 A.D. with Paul's two year imprisonment in Rome?  Why does Luke not mention anything about Nero or the Neronian persecution in the Acts?  How does Luke--as a non-witness--give such a detailed description of Paul's shipwreck near Crete, and why does Paul specifically mention Luke as a travel companion in his epistles of the late 40's?  In short, what sound historical evidence does Ehrman present to support his central assertion that Luke did not write the Acts as a sequel to his Gospel prior to 70 A.D.?         This brings us to the next, central Ehrman-Tubingen assumption: positivism. F.C. Baur and the positivists of the Tubingen school simply assumed that Luke's gospel had to be written after 70 A.D. because it couldn't possibly have prophesied the destruction of Jerusalem.  Big assumption!  No possibility of prophesy, the supernatural, or other spiritual phenomena in the cosmos.  The problem, of course, is that positivism is, itself, taken on faith, and it is the "faith" of Mr. Ehrman, his own theological bias.  Like John Gager, Ehrman is trying, with very dubious analytic success, to make sense of spiritual phenomena using positivistic assumptions.  He is forced to assume that the witness of the "Seventy"--including Luke, the obvious author of the Acts-- was fictional.  Hence, Ehrman's second most basic assumption is that the Hebrew standard for verifying the truth--the testimony of two or more witnesses--is simply erroneous.  Big assumption!      Finally, Ehrman demonstrates in this book a complete lack of knowledge of the mystical theology and praxis of the Orthodox Church.  He attributes the "gospel of asceticism" to Paul, forgetting entirely--if he ever knew it-- the Sermon on the Mount and other explicit teachings of Christ on fasting, prayer, overcoming anger, etc.  He later pontificates about the definitive "passion" of the Orthodox in contrast to the otherworldly asceticism of the Gnostics.  Absolute nonsense!  A central focus of Orthodox Christian spirituality is the development of dispassion and detachment from the material world.  He should study the Apothegmata Patrum, and I should stop reading Ehrman.  His errors inspire too much passion in me!         
 i should have previewed the selections on this collection more closely.  the quality of the recordings is fair to poor and the actual selections are uninspiring, considering the wealth of classics generated during this period of history.  in sum, there are much better anthologies out there than this one 
  The Million Dollar Baby was a bummer. I mean if like long dry stories that may put you to sleep then read this book. The only story that is filled with action and will keep you on the edge of your seats is the short story Million Dollar Baby. The only reason why that is good because it's just like the movie and the movie is great.   The Monkey Look, Black Jew , Rope Burns etc. are about 25-30 pages a peace and they don't keep you into the book as others.The Movie is the only Millin Dollar Baby anything i would waste my time on.   
 So does the author work for the RIAA?" Was my first thought when poking throught this book. Nice content overall, but I simply cannot recommend this book based on one thing alone : The author uses the term "stealing" when discussing copyright infringement. Get it straight! There is a clear legal difference between 'stealing' and 'infringement'. To state things in this manner is not only misleading, but an out-and-out intentional falsehood. Just because the author feels a certain way does not make it law.  In this day and age, there is absolutely NO EXCUSE for using incorrect terms like this in a book specifically about the legal aspects of music. Thumbs way down:( 
 DO Not buy this product...it is not for multifunctional printers.  Linksys just launched the WPSM54G at the Las Vegas Electronic Show 2007.  Go to Linksys for details....and Google the produc 
 I quit reading the book after about ten pages.  I didn't understand most of what I read.  Sentence structure too strange for me.  I don't claim to be really smart, but I do have a college degree and I can read Ameican english.  This is my first posted review.  I usually don't comment.  But, this book was a waste of my money. 
 I bought this cd some weeks ago, its a really good cd if you dont know much of mobys work or for people who collect mobys cds. If you do know mobys work and you want something new this will not help, you can buy "new york new york" single cause thats the only new song. And as for the artwork, the cover is nice but the booklets inside pictures are a bit disappointing. Oh well, moby rulez anyway 
 I'll tell you the truth - I purchased this film only so I could say I now own every movie Alan Rickman has ever done.  He, as any fan will tell you, brings vivid life to every character he does.  His portrayal of Ed the Artist is absolutely what I expected - well done, although the part was small.  Now, for the rest of the movie.  I have never witnessed overacting like this in my life -- not even on the high school stage.  The plot was thin and disjointed, (what do Virgo, prime numbers and Neil Sedaka all have in common?  Did I miss something?) and the scene where they finally catch the murderer is some of the worst acting I've seen.  I've given it two stars strictly because of Alan Rickman's involvement in the film and because I did stick it out until the end.  If you are a fan, rent this just to hear him say, "Don't molest anything-".. 
 This book has little story and a lot of bad porn. Read only if you are into fairy sex 
 I travel a lot, and I am a planner, so I am no stranger to guide books.  This is the worst guide book I have ever used.  The one positive is that it is well written and easy to understand.  But that is, truly, the only positive.      Pricing information was woefully inaccurate.  Hotels that no longer exist were listed.  Hotels that do exist weren't listed.  Multiple website URLs that are no longer live were listed.  Driving directions were not only wrong (e.g. to the Williamsburg Winery), but obviously wrong when a rudientary map was consulted.  The basic fact-checking one would expect for a current guide book had obviously not been conducted.  That leads me to blame the publisher, not the author, and as result I will never again purchase an "Insiders Guide. 
 I ordered this book with the idea, based on how it was advertised,that it was a summary of Esther Wilkins book. Instead,it was a workbook, without answer keys. It requires that you also have the book " Clinical practice of the Dental Hygienist" by Wilkins, for it to be of any value. I was very disappointed as to how it was represented by amazon.ca and the editorial review is not correct for the product 
 I used this book for a global operations class.  It contains both text and cases in one book.  However, cases in some chapters do not directly relate to the content presenting in those chapters.  Moreover, some cases are  really difficult to read and understand the context of the case for  analysis.  However, there are some good HBS cases 
 This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.  Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly  nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading.  Regardless, the second  part, the chapter on "Ways and Means" in particular, is composed  of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state,  replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to  be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.  In truth, he is actually one of its worst  enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression,  revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy 
 I cancelled my subscription to this magazine 6 months ago with a letter to the editor stating that I loved to see nude woman, but subscribed to learn from the masters about photography.  I cannot tell you how disappointed I was when I resubscribed after not taking the magazine for years... it used to be a wonderful magazine chock full of insightful articles, lighting techniques, studio setup diagrams, lots of great stuff... I subscribed to a 2 year deal through an online subscriber and asked them to quit sending it after only 6 months and to keep the money.    Not worth the paper it is printed on- period.  Apeture I hear is pretty good, and I also hear Popular Photography has gotten much better and now only 95% about advertising and product reviews and at least 5% helpful tips and tricks.. 
 The only reason I finished "The Transit of Venus" was the hope of any improvement.  This book took away two hours of my life-two hours that I can never earn back by reading true literature.  The story (is there a story?) is dreadful.  The sentence structures, the paragraph performances, the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if Ms. Hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self-perceived insights.  I will never recommend this book to any audience.  Ms. Hazzard and her publisher should refund my money 
 Why, oh why do you advertise the 1979 version of Crime & Punishment with John Hurt, using the pictures from the 2002 version starring the sublime John Simm. I would download the 2002 version all day, everyday but the misleading pictures are really unfair. Either offer me the version I want, or get the pictures right 
 What this book has is an interesting way to solve problems but I found that using bill handley method. Is wrong and has an error. 8x3=19 using his method. Because 10 is your referance number and you put a negative 2 under 8 and negative 7 under 3 they are negative beacuse there under the numbers of 8 and 3. You add diagonaly to get (8+(-7)) or (3+(-2)) they both equal 1. 1x10=10 multiply the referance number to 1.Then you add the bottom numbers as a positive numbers to get 7+2=9. 10+9=19.  Anyone could figure it's 24. Don't depend on his ability because it's not perfect!! look for a different book!!! 
 I was shocked by the poor quality of the writing from such a well-known author.  Though published in 1995, the reader is expected to ignore the then-well-known realities of DNA testing -- for instance, that shared parentage can be proved by comparing the DNA of siblings, not just from putative sibling to parent.  We're also asked to ignore the realities of fingerprint identification when it would have been immediately helpful in revealing an imposter's criminal record and actual identity.    Adding insult to injury, after ignoring the technique when it logically would have come into play, Sheldon brings in fingerprinting at the very tail of the book, in a complicated scenario involving latent prints to identify not the missing heiress, but rather, a private detective!    Every plot development was telegraphed in advance, and the decedent went from being rather interesting in the first few pages to a one-dimensional (and repetitive) demon throughout the rest of the too-long tome.  Even the vocabulary and sentence structure were overly simplistic.  If you want to read the identical plot but done WELL, try "Amanda" by Kay Hooper, also published in 1995.  Hooper has her character do some marvelously stupid things (again, failing to exploit DNA to the fullest in a timely way), but Hooper's vocabulary, syntax, character development and settings are vastly better than the careless work Sheldon provides in "Morning, Noon, & Night."  I read the books only a week apart.  Hooper's work was engaging, though somewhat predictable; Sheldon's was irritating, and ENTIRELY predictable. 
 We all know to expect the worst at this time of year and to prove our fears were valid here comes dear Jessica's latest attempt to milk the most out of the festive season. As one commentator noted, Jessica has spent the last year or so writhing around on the bonnet of a car wearing next to nothing and now she's asking us to buy her devout Christmas CD! And it's called Re-Joyce for her recently deceased grandmother - well, as she's already exploited her marriage on reality TV, why not turn to dead nana? To be honest, Simpson once had a powerful and pure, if unsubtle, voice but on this set it's all breathiness and coy sweetness. For those who want to listen to seasonal music outside of the shopping malls, there are plenty of legitimate Christmas CDs around. But not this one. Avoid at all costs.   
 The snooze bar doesn't work with the nap timer. Otherwise, this is just an average piece of junk alarm clock 
 We went through the process of cleaning the tank and sterilizing the water, adding the package of sea monkeys, and finally feeding the sea monkeys and NOTHING happened. (...). Hope these are not dead 
 ...Being a new Premiere (and DV) user I picked up little bits and pieces from various sources and just want to learn some topics that are relavent to me, one at a time.  In other words I want to "skip around" topic-wise.  This book is terrible for that.  You open up a chapter that has a title similar to what you want, and right off the bat he is [talking] about the project you were supposidly building up in previous chapters and referring to that.  Also, somehow complex topics are reduced to a few pictures and even fewer words....[In my opinion,]  Adobes "Total Training" tutorials (if you have the $$$) or the "Visual Quickstart" book are much much better 
 This movie is somewhat difficult to rate in my opinion because there are some good things about "Clownhouse" and some bad things about it.  The movie starts out with a young boy named Casey who is for somereason very afraid of clowns...he wets his bed when he has nightmares about them.  It appears the boy is about 11 years old and he has two brothers named Geoffery and Randy, probably 13 and 16 respectively.  Geoffery is sympathetic towards Casey while Randy is a total jerk and seems determined to torment them both.  Well, a carnival comes into town and Casey apprehensively goes along, but his fear of clowns is incredible.  In this movie, it turns out that his fear was well warranted.  At first, I thought this movie was going to be another "The Funhouse" but it was not.  That being said, "The Funhouse" is superior in every way to "Clownhouse".    As "Clownhouse" moves along, the viewer notices three individuals who appear to be quite malevolent in nature.  Indeed, these three men kill three clowns and dress up in their clown costumes.  The killing scenes were below average and not very effective at all.  What takes place afterwards is a long and sometimes boring chase scene where the clowns follow Casey back to his home.  The chase scenes are quite ridiculous to be honest with you...there is no way that Casey could have outrun these grown men and there is also no way that Casey would not have heard them running behind him.  Ultimately, the scenes move to Casey's house where the horror in this film really takes place.    Frankly, the clowns did not appear to be that scary to me at all...in fact, at times, they looked stupid!.  When one considers the great horror movie villains of the past, the clowns looked pretty weak as far as horror movie villains are concerned, and as a result, these clowns were not very effective in creating horror in and of themselves; but, that being said, Salva does a good job of putting the clowns in position in the house unbeknownst to the boys and that is where this movie is effective as horror movie and becomes quite creepy.  However, this is not enough to put this movie over the hump as a really good horror movie.  I thought the moving around and the boys' lack of knowledge of the clowns in the two story house was quite effective and at times, the movie was quite chilling in this respect, but this is really all the movie has to offer.   Once the clowns were discovered however, the movie declined in the level of horror that it had created and this is a sign of an inferior horror movie in my opinion with respect to the classics at least.  Moreover, I thought the times when the clowns actually engaged the young boys in combat were pretty lame...the three men would have easily killed these boys, but I suppose it wouldn't work if that happened, but I think that the movie would have been more effective and credible if the three boys in this movie were older...say, 17, 18 and 19.  Then, one as a viewer, might be willing to "buy" how the young boys disposed of the clowns.    Another flaw of the movie is the acting in this movie is clearly below average and there is little character development except for Casey.  The characters did not provide the movie with enough of a foundation by which the viewer can actually appreciate the movie as a whole and not just based on it's horror values...in other words, the movie just wasn't very well done or directed as a whole.  Indeed, I did not think that the choice of three brothers was very effective as far as characters are concerned, especially being as young as they were.  I thought it was a little much trying to mesh the personalities of the three brothers into such a short movie.  But, like I said, it is hard to rate "Clownhouse" as there really are some chilling moments when the clowns enter the house unbeknownst to the young boys, but that being said, this movie is not without major flaws and all and all, I can only reluctantly endorse this movie as a horror movie worth renting,but cannot really suggest that this movie is worth owning.  2.35 STARS for this flick which in my grading system is about average.  I hope this review is helpful for you in determining the pros and cons of this movie while also explaining the plot without giving away too much of the movie.  
 This book should be avoided by young people.  My sister was given this book by her teacher and still has problems with anorexia... 
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time 
 It was interesting to read a review that commented " It is still true, you can not find any study in those countries about Christianity".  That statement is absolute fiction of course - especially in the 33 Jesuit schools in Syria. Perhaps in the west, it has slipped our minds that Jesus was born in the middle east, and we adopted this middle east religion from them.... The eastern Churches very much study Christianity, and many Muslims around them in the Levant, since Jesus is reverred in Islam. John the Baptist's head is maintained in a memorial monument in the middle of the Ommayad Mosque in Damascus.  The most noted manuscripts used for our common bibles today, were discovered in Alleppo (Syria).  Cursory research reveals Lewis's connections to Intelligence, and that speaks for itself. This book should be read, to balance it, in conjunction with 'Hostage to Khomeini' and 'Venice's War Against Western Civilization', unless one wishes to be taken for a very sophisticated ride. Better still, one could reside in the middle east for a while and see for one's self instead of amplifying other people's writings without the slightest ability, credential or experience to determine whether or not they might be accurate. But be ready for shock - it has little in common to the Psy-Ops portraits we have been spoon-fed with by western media, moronic television porgammes (suchas Fox), and artful books such as this.    It's still a fine read, and awfully convincing - it hit it's mark in that respect. Much knowledge on Christianity - one wonders of the author hails from Christian ancestors ?   Continuing the other review - that people in the middle east would supposedly benefit greatly from reading this book was also amusing, to say the least. People from the Middle East would benefit best from a good lawyer and a truth serum, given the looting and plunder of their resources.. 
 This book is only for those with no math background who have an interest in the Riemann Hypothesis.  I would imagine this to be a small group.  Unfortunately, those from this group will be in a nearly similar state after having read the book 
 What a disappointment!  I ordered PASSIONATE HEARTS as a gift for  newlyweds and must return it to AMAZON because it is so weak.  A very few  good poems surrounded by many unimaginative, cliche-ridden, excusses for  poetry.  This book needed CPR from a editor who hears the vigorous  heartbeat and ecstacy of fine literature instead of the fragmentary  palpitations of 2nd-rate amateurs 
 I was reading this book again the other day and after initially being sucked in, I was vividly reminded of how much I disliked it.  The history is accurate, the writing style is both gripping and crisp. What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.  Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.  The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's naï¿½ve and unique generosity.  That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.   For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!  In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.  She wants readers to get an "insight into the psychology" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.  My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.   I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is "The Virgin's Lover"... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel "The Queen's Fool" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful "Earthly Joys" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)  So, get "The Other Boleyn Girl" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).   But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's "Legacy" 
 I bought the Dirt Devil a few months ago. I read the reviews on it and despite some bad ones, I decided to go for it. How bad could it be...as long as it sucks up the dirt, right??? Well,                                                                                                                                                                                                     guess what? It doesn't even do that! Its awful on my rugs...I just want it to pick up the cheerios my children eat...instead, the vacuum takes the cheerio, breaks it up into smaller pieces and then spits it out the back! I have the same problem on my tile floors. If I vaccum the kitchen while barefoot, I can feel the dirt getting spit back out towards my feet!  I strongly strongly recommend NOT buying it. I am so disappointed and angry that I spent my money on this vacuum 
 The first 8 chapters of this book are in your owners manual. Chapter 1 (what is a serger), Chapter 2 (which one to buy), Chapter 3 (thread and threading), Chapter 4 (cutting your pattern) chapter 5-8(curved seams,securing ends, sewing order and, tension balance) all already in my manual.  Chapters 9-20 get a little more interesting but seems a little dated.  There are tips on how to make a leotard, stirrup pants and leg warmers. First copyright is from 1985 not its not improved much in the third edition.  I would have enjoyed some better pictures too.  If you have a decent manual this really isn't the book for you. For me it was too dated and too basic. 
 Steltenkamp continues the tradition of looking at Indians through the lens  of Christian prejudice.  The book neglects to explore the fact that Black  Elk's daughter, Lucy, was kept from any knowledge of Nick Black Elk's  medicine training and practice.  Nor does the text examine the shame and  shock inducing behavior of the Christian priest who barged into the middle  of Black Elk's healing of a patient, discarding the healer's tools,  ridiculing him and depriving the patient of healing, literally yanking him  out of practice, nor the other priests who continued to badger this  medicine man, (a man revered by his people) until he gave in for the safety  of his family.  The book also fails to give the details behind the fact  that Lucy's brother was knowledgeble about and supportive of Nick's  practice as a medicine man.  For those who are willing to give the text a  close reading, you'll see how the author unwittingly reveals the methods of  Christian clerics' destruction of an ancient culture, the results of that  destruction, and how Nick Black Elk, deposed and put in service of the  priests, was at least able to tap their pockets and provide for his family.   As an example of yet another writer's Christian bias toward the Indians  with examples of their brainwashing and coercion, so thorough, that even  the child of this famous healer was kept in the dark about the truth of her  own father, this book is worth a read 
 What makes this book such tough sledding for the amateur historian? Is it because the book was translated from German to English? Whatever the cause, reading the book is as captivating as reading a similar account from an encyclopedia. It is more like reading a technical report than a book. Now the good news; the book is logically constructed, flows well, and has a dauntingly thorough bibliography. If you muster the self discipline to stay with the author, you will be rewarded with a deep knowledge of the Goths. It is a book by a historian for other academics. Frankly, there are more readable books on the subject available from other authors.   
 I'm a great fan of Joe Vitale's so I was eager to get my hands on his latest book.  But once I did, I was sadly disappointed.    This book is a disjointed collection of contributions from Joe's friends and colleagues, padded with Joe's own contributions.  It's not the manual that it purports to be.  There's is no common thread running through the book, no process to be implemented.    It all comes from Joe's approach to writing many of his books.  He emails his friends and colleagues asking for contributions to his latest book, collects them together, adds his own content and voila there's a book.  Now I have nothing against this approach - it's worked well for many of his ebooks and for 'The E-code' - but it's the wrong approach for this book.    If you're looking for a true manual for living your life this isn't it.  It you're looking for a multitude of views - some contradictory - of tools to implement in your life, it's okay.    But roll on Joe's next book!  
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 Who's idea was it to put Jessica Alba as Sue Storm?  Chris Evans's portrayal of Johnny Storm was somewhat disappointing too, although not as bad as Jessica Alba's portrayal of Sue Storm.  Why do they cast Hollywood big names in these movies just for the sake of having big celebrities in these movies?  They really need to cast people who actually fit the roles and have talent for portraying the characters.  This movie was somewhat good, but it didn't feel all that great.  So far, this movie is just another of Marvel's somewhat disappointing movies along the lines of Elektra, The Incredible Hulk, Xmen 3, Daredevil, and The Punisher.  I was so happy to see Marvel characters getting their own movies, but after seeing what Hollywood does to them, I would rather see Marvel's chracters go back into hiding.  Special effects were good in this movie, and so was the story.  Michael Chiklis as the Thing was great, and his The Thing character makeup was done very well, and he played the character well too, as did Ioan Gruffud with Mr. Fantastic.  Jessica Alba and Chris Evans definitely demoted this movie 
 It is fiction of course. It can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is IMPOSSIBLE! Many reviewers are upset. Upset perhaps but they should not be worried. The Church is protected by Christ's promise that it will not err. Any person of faith sees this book as FICTION. It is a poor attempt to disguise Greely's left wing theology as fiction. The message to those liberals who find "hope" for their cause in this book: IT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. Recommended reading: "Women Priests And Other Fantasies" Greely and his followers are delusional 
 I just read this short story and I didn't like it is just to hard to read and their is really nothing that makes you want to keep on reading this story.  It is verry (not my type).  I read better stories by better  authors.  A good author is Dean Koontz now he has good books and stories.   You would probably like Dean Koontz  more than this Edgar Allan.  Without  having to be confuse at any moment while your reading 
 Shadows on the Rock was a really really boring book! It didnt focus on any one subject and kinda just drifted from story to story. Why, a lot of the words were written in french. I would feel sorry for a person reading this  book that has no french knowledge. I kept finding myself reading the same  page several times before i realized that i had read it already. It doesnt  capture your attention. I have one word for this book. BORING 
 Hoping for more insight on one of my favorite talents and finding nothing new except for Mr. Braun's relentless stream of consciosness on everyone from Vera Lynn to Gladys George and anyone in between. Some times, because of these tangents it was hard to keep straight just who he was talking about.  Possibly the worst written and least researched book I've ever read. let's hope the next bio on this gal is better. Would love to hear more about the making of her best film "Love Me Or Leave Me." she deserves more scrutiny as an artist.  
 Don't get me wrong mellow cds can be great as shown by Jerry Cantrell's Boggy Depot and Pearl Jam's No Code.  This one's just boring though.  There is no varience in the songs except in "Charm Attack" whick could never carry the rest of disc 
 I'm studying for the CPA. I bought the book because it's required for a course in school. But to actually learn for the CPA exam, I'll toss this one aside for one that provides a solutions manual. Authors who withold the manual for the instructors benefit miss a fundamental point about economics - who the customer is. It's the student that the book is written for and it is the student who pays for the course. Breffni University of Chicag 
 My teacher read this book to our class today. It was hard too follow because there were too many things going on. I do not recommend this book for kids under 10 
 when i first got this album and heard it i was dissapointed.its not what i expected at all from mike,dan,and jennifer charles.admittedly i'm more familier with mike pattons faith no more work than i am with the other artists.after hearing people talk about it i was expecting some type of expiremental R&B/Soul album.what i got was some half baked attempt at a parody album of sorts.yeah theres underlying respect for the genre their parading but its verry well hidden.first and formost the album isn't funny.....AT ALL.also dan's productions are repettetive as hell.  most of my perception is from my own ignorance in not knowing what i was getting.so yeah you can probably disregard this review,but my dissapointment still remains.especialy after hearing mike pattons vocals an a track called evidence off of faith no more's "king for a day,fool for a life time" cd.but nope theres nothing like that on this album.wich is sad cause i really do belive mike can deliver a r-kelly like album like someone else mentioned.or atleast something in the same vein as R&B/jazz/soul singer "kem"....but oh well 
 I can see by the abundance of good reviews that the formula of using template beats is alive and well.  Any one of us could have made this album.  Just go to a neighborhood teenager with a drum machine pay him $100 to purchase 11 minutely variant beats and you have this album.   This album has absolutely no originality.  We have heard this album many times before and I'm sure we will hear it many times in the future.  I give it two stars for the fact that it does make for adequate generic r&b background music for a lite dinner party 
 My shuffle suffered the blinking green-orange lights so I took it into the Apple store. A salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn't do anything, and said I would have to sign up for a appointment at the "Genius" bar. At that appointment, the "genius" said he couldn't fix it, and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple "genius" doesn't involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut. The 'genius" then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing.  Perhaps it should be retitled the "idiot bar. 
 There are just some trilogy's that should not be made - and the Wild Things trilogy is one of them. This is not really a trilogy per se, since each of the films carries with it the same story, with the same twists. If you have seen the first, you have basically seen each of the sequels... except the sequels are both much worse. Take out the big name actors and make a direct-to-DVD release... and you have Wild Things: Diamonds In The Rough.  I am sure you all know the story by now, but here is a brief synopsis... "Things get steamy in Blue Bay, Florida, when Marie, a 17-year-old beauty, gets caught in a tangle of deceit and double-crossing after meeting the promiscuous Elena, the new girl at school. Will they get away with the perfect crime or is someone else behind this scheme?  If you have seen one of the Wild Things films, you have seen them all. This film lacks the quality of the original - mainly because we already know the twists and turns to come. This disc does look great, and sounds pretty good, but the film takes away from the overall DVD presentation. If you want your Wild Things fix, the original version is the one to watch 
 This book was really hard for me to get into. If you are like me and read a little and then dont pick a book up again for another few days, this one is too confusing. Just when you get to know a list of characters, the book starts a whole new story that is within the current story with all new characters.  Also I felt there was just too much useless side information that was just filler. I am really busy and dont have much time to read so I want to be entertained (plus I have a horrible attention span).   If you are the type of person who will read a book from start to finish without stopping this might be for you. But otherwise this is just too much info and too many characters 
 What a magnificently high brow review of the subject of pruning.  If you can understand what these highly educated folks are talking about then you will not need this book.    The wonderfully proper English manner of only indexing by Latin names, colorful use thereof throughout with only minor mention of common names renders this tome utterly useless to the lay gardener.  An advanced degree in botany is required to fully grok what they attempt to convey.  Shun this item.  Wait for a revised version that makes this a useful book vs. the current flogging of hard won degrees 
 First of all, I did not exactly 'read' this biography. Instead I purchased the CD version which I distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (I have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way, and still been able to read many more technology related books).  I had great expectations from this book, having recently enjoyed three biographies of Lincoln. I have to confess that I was sorely disapointed. I found the research of Mr McCullough to lack the kind of details that I have enjoyed in biographies from Walter Isaacson, Richard Carwardine, or Doris Goodwin. I do not seek a beautiful story in a biography, but rather a reliable source of facts that I can use to form my own opinion of a character. In this context, I find Mr McCullough's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of John Adams and his contribution to America. I also enjoy direct quotes from letters, speaches, autobiographies, as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period, the relationships to contemporary characters, ...) surounding a promonent figure. Usage of the English language in politics has dramatically evolved since Mr Adams' time, and I missed 'hearing' the voice of John Adams. Instead, this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author. Finally, having read other biographies of the founding fathers, I was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between Adams and Franklin.  All in all, my lasting impression is that Mr McCullough did a great job at bringing John Adams and the early American Revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions. Had I known that, I might have passed on this biography and instead explore Mr McCullough's fictional work 
 I don't even remember why Brazilian Duos was recommended to me here on amazon. Perhaps it is because I enjoy Bonfa, Deodato, Gilberto, Gismonti, Nogueira and some other Brazilian musicians that amazon's computer decided I would probably like this as well. I don't. I bought this several years ago and listened three or four times before deciding to shelve it. Then recently, I listened again hoping to find something I missed. I didn't. It remains underwhelming. There is nothing special in her voice, in the music, or in the arrangements. Despite that I am more than willing to try something new, I just can't find anything on this CD that inspires me. I'm not saying its bad music, I'd rather listen to this than a lot of other music that's out there. All I am saying is that it doesn't speak to me! Perhaps there are other Luciana Souza albums that I would like more, but after my experience with Brazilian Duos, I would have to hear them before buying 
 This book should has little to do with repairing computers. If you want to know how a monitor works, how to take a digital image, or set up a computer surveillance system it does a good job of expaining this and how the stuff inside the computer works. If you've been around computers a while you probably will know a lot of this.   The book has 20 pages on diagnosing and repairing computers and 25 pages on building one; this is explained very vaguely.  If it didn't cost so much to ship it back, I would return it.  
 Charlotte.... oh God! what a change!!! that's pretty sad. I didn't liked this album, just one tune... the one of Even God.... but i hope youll gï¿½t back to sing like an angel 
 This book promised humor in the manner of a girl chick book, the type I usually like.  Within 5 pages, the main character's dad dies.  Not only was this a bit morbid for a comical book, but it also occurred way to soon.  I didnt give a rats --- about her father dying.  I didnt feel like I got to know the character enough to care.  I didnt; consequently, I put the book down after about 20 pages.  Which is why I wouldnt even rate this item at all 
 This is one of the most useless Java books. I am a professor teaching JAVA in a state university. From my teaching experience and the feedbacks from students, I do not think this work is even worth reading. This book intends to introduce data structure through JAVA programming, but it does not achieve either goal. First, it is not a JAVA introductory book. If you are new to Java, the Just JAVA 2 (by van der Linden) is the best choice. If you want to know more about java, Core Java 2 is the good choice and can also be used as reference. If you want to learn data structure, there are many better books available on pure data structure or data structure with C++.   This book is too expensive for students, and it does not deliver the content that is worth 1/10th of the book price. The only reason I use this for my class is that it is required by University and I cannot change that :(   P.S. if you just want to learn more about Java, Think in JAVA is a great book and is free. The author (Bruce Eckel) did a great job in writing a great book and sharing it free on the internet [...]. 
 Mackinnon's more theoretical discussions are based on Marxism and Freudianism.  She doesn't really bother to offer any sort of "Epistemology of Method" or "Prolegamena," so the many philosophical issues that surround her approach are simply left hanging.  This raises serious concerns in light of very critical, devastating attacks on both Marx and Freud over the last 10 years or so.  Marx's economic and metaphysical theories, while all the rage among certain quarters in the Humanities, are embarassingly simple-minded and reductivist as anyone can determine who has actually spent a good time reading him.  Freud, thanks to Patricia Churchland's excellent book, has finally been shown to be the pseudo-scientist quack most reasonable people always knew him to be.  As such, MacKinnon's book is based on two thinkers whose theories have been completely discredited and dismissed.  What does this say, then, for her work?  If you want a serious, philosophically substantial work on modern political theory, read Habermas, Rawls, Nozick, Onora O'Neill, etc - 
 that Marabel Morgan divorced her husband.  I'm not sure if that is true or not 
 Mr. Chowdhury's writing is quite dry and I didn't get much out of reading this book.  I was quite disappointed after hearing so much from others 
 I had to buy this book for a college course that I was taking. I suspect that the only people buying this book are those who must do so in order to pass a college course. This book is trite, cliche-ridden and not at all objective. Bederman is to the far left of the political spectrum and her politics are found all throughout this book. I've learned virtually nothing new from reading the cliches that Bederman merely repeats in this book. Bederman wouldn't know an original idea if one fell on her 
 This has got to be the worst film version of an Austin story I've ever seen. The plot is only tenuously connected with the book; as for the characters, hairstyles & costumes, it should be subtitled "Fellini Does Austin" because it most closely resembles the "Satyricon" IMO. The makeup, costuming, & hair on all the characters is not only not even close to reasonably accurate historically, but downright grotesque & bizarre - and that's just the lead character, Catherine. The rest are worse. Bad acting, too. Very lame film. The Austin estate should sue BBC for turning out such a turkey & using her name 
 I just finished Scratch the Surface, my first Susan Conant book, and was very disappointed.  Perhaps Ms. Conant is more familiar with dogs, since she certainly does not do well with the two cats featured in this book.  I also found the writing to be childish and almost amateurish, more suited to children than to an adult audience.  The plot was nicely convoluted, but the writing style could have definitely been more elevated.  This is not a book I would recommend to cat mystery lovers. 
 I enjoy food but most of the recipes in this book are things I wouldn't eat in the first place 
 My daughter got this for Christmas from her Grandma (who worked long and hard to get this for her)and she was so happy and excited when she opened this Christmas Eve. She was only able to enjoy it for 1 month when it decided to only play certain CD's. It will soon be on it's way back to Amazon for an exchange. Hopefully, the new one will work and all will be well. It is very, very cute and my 7 year old just loves it. We are keeping our fingers crossed that there won't be any problems with the next one. We will keep you posted. 
 One of these days the YA publishers will stop using actual YA writers for their tomes. Sure, the young adults are the same age as the readers, but that means nothing when character development and insight are sacrificed.  This book is about a nerd creepy loser whose given a nanocomputer to train him to be cool. So he becomes a jackass creepy loser. Most of the supporting characters are types and the non-teenage characters are either boring or ridiculous. There's even some homophobia thrown in as the English teacher swishes every which way saying MAAAAAAAAAA (I'm not sure what that means either).   While the book centers on the narrator's attempt to go out with a girl in his drama club, you never get why he likes her. In fact, she never seems to be a coherent human being. Almost every time she's in the narrative she's doing something off-kilter that makes no sense to anyone. The only reason why you sympathize with her is because she's got to deal with this jerk, and even then you really wish she'd just put a restraining order on him.  While there are moments of insight, where the author and the narrator come up against the fact that they aren't the only people in the world with problems, they are few and far between.  Overall, this is a horrible book with horrible characters and lousy plotting. The only good thing that you can say for the book is that it's not half as irritating as the audio CD 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.  This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.  I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.  I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.   If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect 
 I read this book while studying both contemporary North American and cross-cultural weddings and marriages.  Ingrahms book describes the "white wedding" a white upperclass affair as discriminatory and exclusive.  She focuses on the institution of marriage being perpetuated by old white folk and major corporations.  Unfortunatley she does not expand into the universality of marriage.  I do not recomend this book.  It is narrow and inconclusive 
 I cannot stress this enough, this book is very boring and longwinded.  Only if you are doing research on this time period do you need to even consider this book.  It book talks very little about the Declaration and more about famous people that you already know about 
 Without a doubt, one of the worst breakbeat CD's ever recorded. The mixing is terrible, the track selection leaves an incredible amount to be desired, absolutly no mood is created, and the mastering is even done poorly. Seems somebody got on her knees for Icey to put out an album.... we already know she sucks 
 Ok, the only reason I saw this movie is because Jeremy Sisto! is in it. Him and his performance is the only reason I rated this movie 2 stars. Elizabeth Hurley does give somewhat of a good performance but overall, I found this movie both boring and confusing at times. Not a horror movie. Only worth the rental fee if you are a Sisto fan 
 Beware of this book.  I purchased it believing I was getting a paperback copy of "The Professional Chef".  I waited over three months before finally getting my copy.  What a disappointment.  Instead of receiving a book filled with great tips on how to become a better chef, I get an outline of a CIA course!  Not one suggestion.  Not one how-to.  Nothing that would be of any help to anyone who was not sitting in a CIA class 
 Wasted talent.  None of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying.  Some funny stuff.  Craig Ferguson can do better.  Charlotte Church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte.  Every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters 
 After reading this title in an undergraduate philosophy class, and reading it carefully and thoroughly, I feel confident giving it a bad review.  It was selected by the professor, who I assume is a fan, but I know I, and all my friends in class, extremely dislike this book.  I'm a very strong student, an environmentalist, and whatever else you think I need to be a credible reviewer, but this book is very un-engaging.  If you're a professor yourself, I urge you not to use it in class.   The arguments are at times internally inconsistent (the author feels comfortable negating opponents for using the same argument structures she later uses), hyperbolic (the author creates extensive yet repetitive lists of victims of various injustices, redundantly reclassifying the same individual in several ways to make the list longer), and on and on.   The nail in the coffin, from a student's point of view, is that it does so in an extremely boring manner.  I feel bad that the first review is such a negative one, but from the eye of a undergrad, it's a really bad book.  Hopefully a professional philosopher can be more constructive, but undergrad students (its a class for majors and non-majors, to fill a core requirement) are not an appropriate audience for this book 
 I recently read this book for a ELAN class @ UGA. I thought it was terrible and pointless. The characters lack depth and the theme of the book is not developmentally appropriate for 7th or 8th graders. The book was around 100 pages and leaves the reader wishing he had done something better with his time. My professor scolded me for not wanting to read this book to my future classes. She claimed I was scared to read books to my kids. (I guess she is refering to the religious implications in the book) She is absolutely right. I am terrified to read bad books to my students. 
 After reading about Ambrose Bierce and his fierce wit this book was a real  let down. Too many stories, all of a similar vein. I should have gotten the  Devil's Dictionary!! 
 If you look at the March 2004 issue of the International Association of Bloodstain Pattern Analysts, you'll find a very negative review of this book. Given that the reviewer (Herbert Leon MacDonell, the Director of Laboratory of Forensic Science  Bloodstain Institute of Corning, New York) and all members of IABPA actively work in the field of forensics, I'd take their word for it. Here's an excerpt from the review, which can be found on the web at http://www.iabpa.org/March2004News.pdf  "Many fine books have been written on the general subject of forensic science but this is not one of them. It only takes reading the first page for the reader to discover that this book is not going to be a source of accurate forensic information."   The reviewer goes on to say:  "...the frightening aspect is that lay persons who purchase such garbage are unaware of how inaccurate the things they are reading really are. It is unfortunate that there are publishers out there who will print a manuscript without having some form of peer review to determine whether there are a few minor errors or is it so bad like this book, that they should trash it. 
 Lots of nice bungalow pictures if that's what you want. Doesn't appear as this book had an editor, so many typos and errors. If you need a book that will help you decide on colors don't waste your money on this one. The color photography although nice, does not come close to matching the actual colors named in the text. On top of that the colors described in the text are often just plain wrong. The Sherwin Williams Color Chips in the book are totally off when compared to the actual color chip card from Sherwin Williams. The icing on the cake is that the book binding was so poor it disintegrated after about a week of limited usage. The good news is, this book is now serving a more suitable role as part of a landfill. What a waste of money 
 Let's explore Young Jeezy and ask a few questions.  Can Jeezy spit 16 bars that rhyme? NO  Can Jeezy distinguish between a verse and a hook? NO  Does Jeezy explore other topics other than trapping, pimping, and killing? NO  Has Jeezy ever killed anybody? NO  Does your little sister or brother rap better than Jeezy? YES  Can Jeezy battle with Nas/Jay-Z/Eminem and win? NO  Can Jeezy battle a brick an win? NO  Does Jeezy provide a negative influence for kids? YES  Will Jeezy ever be a legend? NO. There are far better artist in the South 
 I am furious with this book. It's 300 pages of advertisement you have to pay for.  What it says is this: "Hey, the Quigong exercises by Chunyi Lin will heal the planet, but you'll have to buy our $250 self-study course to learn it." There are two exercises included in this "book", half-assedly explained. The rest is Chunyi's story and page after page of testimonials (yes - TESTIMONIALS! Like the cheesy ones on those webpages where people are desperately trying to sell you things). Ye Gads! Why did I buy it?  Bottom line: If you really want to learn this system, don't waste your money on this book - rather, get the self-study course from learningstrategies.com or attend one of his classes 
 In reading Girlfriend in a Coma it struck me that it was Coupland's attempt to find meaning in life. The ending of Girlfriend in a Coma was a disappointment and Coupland never seems to have recovered. All families are psychotic, but this book is so fanciful that it lacks the power to invoke feelings of reality. The power of Coupland's early books was in their ability for people to see themselves as GenX or as Microserfs (although this lacked something). All Families is three parts slapstick ridiculousness and one part hyperbolic soap opera family.  Douglas, if you're reading this - keep looking for truth, because you have settled for mediocrity just like the characters in this book 
 While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.  I'm extremely surprised this is a "best seller". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.  Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear 
 I bought this cd without listening to it because I love Nickel Creek so much. What a big mistake. MAS is just dull. In a world of exciting and glorious music, what a disappointment it was to buy this cd 
 I came to this book with a truly open mind. Knowing little about Islam, but believing that a billion or so people can't ALL want to blow me up, I was looking for an understandable explanation of the roots of today's problems. I didn't find it in Ms. Manji's book, I'm afraid. Like many journalists, I think she had trouble moving from the snappy, quick analysis of issues that is probably her journalistic trademark, to the more thoughtful exploration readers of a whole book might want.   Just peek at the titles of her chapters--How I Became a Muslim Refusenik, Seventy Virgins?, When Did We Stop Thinking?, Thank God for the West. Good headlines, no doubt, but a bit too cute for a supposedly serious book.   Manji's cleverness simply gets in the way. For example, she says Muslims portray themselves as monolithic, and won't apply critical thinking to their fellow Muslims' actions. Her example is the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban in 2001, a few months before 9/11. As an excuse, a fellow Muslim cites the treatment of Muslims in Palestine. Manji's response:   "Excuse me?! Somebody return me to earth, or transport my butt to a part of the solar system where we distinguish between justice and justification." She admits some connection between the injustices in the Middle East and Muslim extremism. But, she asks, "how did that textured relationship justify Muslim silence in the West toward the scripturally supremacist, Buddha-bombing, woman pulverizing, kite-banning, execution-enamored Taliban?"  This isn't analysis--it's flippant journalism.  I wearied of all this around page 100. I'm still looking for the book that will shed some light on the deep divide between Islam and the West--this book isn't it 
 I wish I had read these reviews before I bought the book.  I would have saved myself $26.00.  As an American who has traveled and now lives in Europe part of the year I was continually appalled at how she maligned other travelers. She writes of being invited to be a guest speaker on a cruise ship and insults in print all of the other passengers. She had a free trip while others paid, but she ridiculed everyone. I was totally horrified of the things that she said about her former Father-in-law. Those statements had no relevance to the book and they do not belong in public print. This man is the grandfather of her daughter.  I am astounded at how she thrashed him publicly. Her book consisted mainly of telling the reader what town she was in, what was wrong with it and the rest of the chapter boring us with what books she was reading and quoting other authors, and relaying in detail every morsel that her and her husband ate.  I have visited and even lived in several of the towns she wrote about. Of the ones I have not been to unfortunately, nothing she wrote made me want to visit them. I am an avid reader of travel books and essays.  I will never again read anything by Frances Mayes.      
 My daughter asked for this movie and I agree with most of the children's reviews. The movie was not entertaining and too mature for its intended audience. And last but certainly not least, why are there no other races represented in the my scence crew?! No wonder your sales of barbie and crew are down. Matel needs to wake up! I am now a faithful BRATZ customer because they make a point to include more than one race in all of their dolls and movies. And the bratz movie is better 
 Buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe. The real shoe has an ankle strap. Also, the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller. I had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs 
 I thought it was good and sad. Sad because she didn't find her real mom. I think people should read it because it tells a lesson and it tells a happy ending 
 This is one book about Howard Hughes that should be returned to the book seller if bought without reading it first. The author, an Englishman, apparently tries to be "popular" in America by being clinically dirty. His "shocking" revelations have no references, and he seems to be a grand master of the "he undoubtedly said..." school of research. The book certainly does not belong in a family library, and as far as university libraries go, it has no scholarly value 
 Mark's clever as a wizard but just as cold.  For fans of technique only, those to whom concerns for the characters don't matter, but being post-modern and just plain edgy is as good as it gets.  Steve Vai plays more notes than Mozart, but never played a memorable tune.  Costello's so wound up in "being a writer" that he forgot to make his readers give a damn.  Maybe next time, because a good book's probably in there somewhere 
 Max Byrd's novel contains more research than drama, and unfortunately not all the research is accurate. At the end of Chapter 12 and the beginning of Chapter 13, he has his heroine Selena, a daguerrotypist accompanying an expedition to make a record of an eclipse in the southwestern US in 1839, make a demonstration of her work. She exposes her plate for ten minutes, which is accurate and then removes the copper plate from her camera, preparing to develop it. Unfortunately, the plate is miraculously transformed into a glass plate (not to appear in photography until the advent of ambrotypes, some years later)before the image is formed. I hoped very much to be informed and entranced by this book, with its cover blurbs promising involvement with Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, inventors of the first computer. Unfortunately, Babbage and Lovelace make only cameo appearances, and the novel's main characters tend to blur together, except for Selena, a product of a French father and American mother. The research was, as I say, ambitious but flawed 
 I am always looking for easy, but delicious weeknight recipes and picked this up because it was on sale. The running lists of brand names ingredients in the recipes gave me pause, but since the Semi-Homemade series appears to be very successful, I thought I'd give it a try.   This book disappointed on many levels, primarily because the recipes are so unhealthy. I'm not a health nut but any means, but most of these recipes are deep in junk food territory. If I made them every night, I'm quite certain I'd have a family of butterballs in no time flat.  Given the choice of so many other quick and easy cookbooks out there, I can't see why anyone would choose to go down the Semi-Homemeade road. I can easily recommend books like "Half-Scratch Magic", any of Leslie Revsin's "The Simpler, The Better" books or many of Rachael Ray's 30-Minute Meal books, that don't rely so heavily on cans and boxes to produce delicious, healthy dishes with a minimum of fuss. Eating Well's "Healthy in a Hurry" has some very good recipes in it, too.  I finally saw Sandra Lee's show, after buying the book, and could barely watch it. Perhaps I'm being unfair because I only saw one episode, but she seems extremely weird and I found it hard to watch her "cook."   By and large, I found that the recipes in Semi-Homemade Cooking are most similar to those found in some of the more obscure community cookbooks which you can get in bundles on eBay for less than a dollar 
 This book was a very organized.  That is one of the few things it had going for it.  The problem I found was the added zodiac, and the fact that it had no real place.  There wasn't even enough information to tell you about what time of year it was.  And where did the information about this New zodiac "Arachne" come from.  There was good information on the Dark aspects of the moon, But is still can't grasp Arachne and when exactly this happens.  My advice is to take it with a grain of salt and enjoy some tidbit 
 I own all the the Chicago albums that Terry Kath participated in.  I avoided subsequent albums because I just *didn't like* what I heard on the radio.  After all this time I thought "that's silly", and bought this album.  Ugh.  When I say "this band" in the review title, I of course am referring to post-Kath Chicago.  The band that includes Kath is one of my favorites.  Too bad 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 I had rented this movie on VHS awhile back and thought that even with it's slightly "B rated" style it was a very good movie for the genre. Good acting, great special effects, and a top notch storyline make this a classic in my collection. I have purchased the DVD through several online vendors and have yet to find one that will play in any of my DVD players or computers. I highly recomend this film, but suggest the VHS version 
 Boy, was this a bunch of trash and waste of money!  It's obvious that Joan  is trying to hang on her little sisters coat tails but she just doesn't  have the writing skills and someone out there who told her "your books  great darlink" should have been a real friend and told her what a  bunch of garbage it is.  And she continues to write which I just don't  understand!  This book is boring.  Don't waste your money!  Buy the  Enquirer instead.  It'll be more entertaining 
 Unfortunately, instead of an thorough analysis of the genesis, justifications, and problems with overarching property rights, DeLong acts as a mouthpiece for other property rights activists.  DeLong covers some of the same ground as Congressman Richard Pombo in his 1996 This Land Is Our Land, simply emphasizing anomalous examples instead of practicable solutions.  DeLong's denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill-founded.  DeLong's politics overcome his analysis.  This book is similar to his condemnation of industry for their recognition to the denial of carbon dioxide emissions.  (...)  His political agenda overwhelm his rational 
 Make sure that you want to buy this type of book.  It was not at all what I was expecting 
 A great adventure story, but beyond the courage of the Astronauts and the intense devotion of NASA controllers, (as literature,) it is of interest only to those with special knowledge, in the field. I found it heavy going when the authors focused on the technical aspects of the mechanical failure. And there is alot of this from beginning to end.   There have been books which are centered on my area of expertise. I found them fascinating throughout. Many of my friends were bored.   
 Klutz strike again only they miss. I expected clear instructios that even I could follow. I have notmade one thing only half a dozen messed up beginings. Sorry Klutzes won't learn hear 
      This book is not very exciting. The main character, Angelica Chapee has six days to lose her virginity in order to inherit the money that her grandfather has left her since he has recently passed away. The funny thing is that Angelica's grandfather just happens to be rich. This leaves Angelica surprised being that she never knew her grandfather was a millionaire.      This book is extremely boring with no surprises or action at all. It lingers with the fact of Angelica losing her virginity within six days. I don't like how the author stays on the same topic, meanwhile taking forever to get to the point! This makes me not want to continue reading the book. Although I am still reading the book and also hoping there will be some action somewhere throughout it. My opinion is that if you want to read a romance, don't read this one. It will only be a waste of your time!!!!!! 
 Have to to go extreme steps to get it to play back on my Mac. I f***ing hate crappy DRM 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 I am fat, and I have always been fat. I have never hated myself. I was a fat child, nobody ever made fun of me, called me names, molested me at recess or in the movies, and while my childhood was not a bed of roses, it was not because I was fat. This woman hates herself and I feel sorry for her, but it makes me angry that she blames all her problems on food. Her mother was abusive, told her she wished she had never been born, that she was useless and ugly. She slapped her and cursed her and made her life miserable and she blames it all on being fat. But if she had not been fat, her mother would have found another excuse for the abuse, because she had a problem, not the child. This book just perpetuates the idea that all fat people are miserable and it simply is not true. Too many people blame their misery on being fat, but most fat people are truly happy...At least this one is....Leave this book on the shelf.. 
 I most of Ofra Haza's other albums, and like them quite a bit.  My dislike of this album rises from the cheesy sounding, tinny music.  I like older pop, like Abba, as some reviewers compared this album to, but this thing sounds primitive by comparison.  I was seriously disappointed and no longer am surprised that this CD didn't make it to the U.S 
 I recently ordered Pat the Bunny In the Garden Board Book for my daughter.  She had the paper editions of Pat the Bunny, Pat the Cat and Pat the Puppy and has enjoyed them so much they are tattered.  When I saw the In the Garden edition I thought it would be a perfect addition to her library. We live in Germany so I must order all books off of the internet and do not have an opportunity to look at them before I make a purchase. Needless to say I was more than disappointed when the book arrived.  As it states on the back cover of the book "Pat the Bunny is recognized as the most important first book for baby's early development.  Its unique interactive and sensory approach helps stimulate a baby's developing mind." The only thing interactive about this book is the first page with the bunny fur.  There is absolutely no other type of interactive stimulation in this book. The makers of this book have taken advantage of the popularity of Pat the Bunny in order to make a profit on a newer product that does not even attempt to live up to the claims made on the back cover.  This is a pathetic excuse of "a unique interactive and sensory approach".  The story itself is nice but to pass it off under the name of Pat the Bunny just for the recognition factor is inexcusable 
 I loved "Wishcraft" when it first came out decades ago.  Then, it was relevant to my life.  Now in my fifties, retired from a physically-active job for medical reasons, and planning my future, I bought this book.  The next day, I returned it.  Barbara seems to think that forty is old.  Odd, considering she's older than I am.  Just please be aware that if you're over forty, this book is not going to be terribly relevant to your life.  It's probably terrific for people under forty, but if you're past early mid-life, forget it.  Another thing that made me question the validity of Barbara's more recent work was her insistence that once you've nabbed a partner, or settled into a career, or otherwise gotten your life together, you should put away your mirror and let yourself go.  Yes, I'm serious.  I'm paraphrasing, but that's the advice.  And it's psychologically unsound.  My advanced drama class used to put on shows for retirement homes and long-term care centers.  One thing I learned was that when a person (of any age) stopped caring for their appearance, it was a sign of depression and, in many cases, giving in and giving up.  I also know, from a personal experience with clinical depression, that the quickest way to lift your spirits -- even a little -- is to dye your hair or buy a great new outfit.  This applies to men as well as to women.  Yet Barbara Sher encourages us to just forget about our physical appearance.  I wonder how much longer she'll be writing (or doing anything else).  Angela Lansbury, on her wonderful videotape of several years ago, said that when she got older and was given more matronly acting jobs, she gained more than a few pounds.  And she decided it was all right.  She was older.  She didn't have to prance around in a swimsuit.  But Ms. Lansbury couldn't stand it, and lost that weight.  She respected herself too much to just let it all hang out.  From what I've learned, that's healthy.  What Barbara Sher advocates is not.  Again, this book is probably helpful to younger people.  But the "any age" she refers to in the title doesn't go much past forty 
 I wonder how long it will be before Frost's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. These are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed. How earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding. Bad poetry from a twisted man 
 Margaret Mead was my professor and advisor.  As such, when I read something attributed to her that doesn't sound like her at all, I want to know where it came from.  Margaret had among many other admirable qualities, the fundamental values of a consumate academic scholar.  Gurian's book bandies her name and her reputation and her purported ideas, without a shred of evidence--not a single reference to a single publication--to back up his misinterpretations of her  work and the exploitation of her honored name in support of his fundamentally ethnocentric preconceptions.   
 I really didnt find answers to anything regarding the meaning or essence of money.  Only the authors confused philosophy.  He is obviously brought up in a Jewish household which holds money tantamount to the highest esteem one can get from life.  Money is an energy, nothing more.  I dont want to hear anymore neurotic ramblings on about this subject from this guy 
 Initially I got into the book and began to enjoy it.  HOwever, my stomach and enjoyment of the book began to take a serious nosedive as the character of Candice began to be revealed.  All enjoyment of the storyline was removed once Candice found out one of her ancestors was black. The fact that she suddenly considered herself to be a black woman was beyond comprehension.  I cannot fathom what Briscoe was doing in writing such a thing or where she felt that this was going.  It is one thing to acknowledge that there was once a one drop rule, but to take it to this extent in a book written by a black woman no less was pretty disconcerting.  Perhaps there is something deeper here that I am missing.  I really hope so.  Overall I would say the book was lacking in depth.  It is one of those books that you might take along on vacation when you know you want something light to read, but not something heavy that is going to require lots of thought and analysis.  Perhaps others will enjoy the soap opera style writing, but I did not 
 This album has all the grammy winners but the best is Green Day's 'AMERICAN IDIOT' 
 Buy a Girls Gotta Do What a Girls Gotta Do instead.  Snortland's book is more of a feminist's political treastise on how males and females are raised and nurtured versus a pragmatic approach on skills to identify potential threats and strategies to deal with them.  She does hype Impact training which sounds like a beneficial program. I bought it for my daughter, but read it first. Actually, I tried to read it; halfway through the book I  decided to toss it.  
 Having owned several Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers over a 20 year period I can, with authority, say that this model is a big disappointment. The battery life is outstanding, but that's because the motor speed is so slow it's not using much juice. And with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor. The next time I won't pinch pennies; the higher priced models from Panasonic are worth the price difference 
 While the clock works quite well and resets as it should, the wireless outdoor thermometer is way off. I base this on two other wireless brands I own,an Acu-rite and a Oregon Scientific, along with the local NOAA weather broadcast, also WFIE TV. The Acu-rite temp=18.2 F, the Oregon Scientific+18.5 F, and the NOAA broadcast temp @ 20:09 Jan28/07 = 18F, Local TV station WFIE-TV=18F.  [...]  As I write this, The Weather Channel also reports it is 18 degrees F at 20:30.      The La Crosse WS-8256U-AL reports it is 23.5 F, more than 5 degrees off. In my opinion,a clock/thermometer costing this much should be dead on.  Buy it for the time, NOT the temperature 
 Grabhorn starts with the assumption that our feelings can change the course of events around us. While there is some truth to this assumption, Grabhorn claims that our feelings could even change seemingly "random" events (like getting rear-ended on the highway). One logical question is that if two people "ask the universe" (to use Grabhorn's terminology) for opposing events, who would succeed? The question belies the assumption that there exists a plurality of distinct and individual freewill. This assumption is conveniently discarded throughout the book. Claims that whatever one asks for will come to pass litter the entire narrative.  Grabhorn states that we need to "vibrate" at the high frequencies (i.e., those that make us "feel good") attracting the same kind of frequencies to us. Her analogy is that we are magnets attracting the same kind of frequency back to our lives. The Law of the Universe that she proclaims is: "Like attracts like."  One issue with Grabhorn's analogy is that we tend to appreciate a blend of different frequencies. Musical instruments all resonate at different frequencies. It is the combination of different frequencies that appeals to us. Music (spiritual or otherwise) incorporates a variety of frequencies and tempos to arouse our souls. Another is whenever in nature there are forces of attraction and repulsion, it is opposites that attract. In magnetism, we learn that opposite poles attract. It is sometimes posited that we are naturally attracted not only to the opposite sex but also to those with accents that are different from our own.  Fundamentally, the assumptions Grabhorn makes are more outlandish than what most readers are comfortable making. The process of "feeling good" does have medically and psychologically proven benefits, but is living "as if" something were true is an entirely different issue. Grabhorn's techniques of make-belief would be too Machiavellian for our post-modern outlook.  The book could have greatly benefited from the services of an editor. The text could have been more concise and the narration could have been more crisp and lucid. A good first draft, but more work is needed.  Armchair Interviews says: Hampton Roads publishes books for the evolvinghHuman spirit on metaphysical subjects including visionary fiction, complementary and alternative medicine, self-help, science, and spiritual. This seems to be a book you will either LOVE or HATE--depending on your point of view 
 Michael Gondry has followed "The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" with "The Science of Sleep."  Unfortunately, the film spends more energy on the fantastic way it tells the story than on telling a story.  In short, we go through all these dreamlike images of hands that suddenly become huge, a dancing donkey or Bernal flying over a claymation-like cityscape, but that don't further the story.  As an actor, Gael Garcia Bernal is such a nice looking young guy that you seem to want to root for him.  However, he became increasingly strange and unlikable as the film went on.  Bernal won the Best Supporting Actor Award from the French Academy of Cinema in 1999 for "La Buche" and was impressive in "The Motorcycle Diaries."  As Stephane, he's more neurotic.  Sometimes it's hard to tell if he's asleep or awake; or in which world the big change in his life is supposed to happen.  Apparently, that change is supposed to be that he falls in love.  The film teases romance with Stephanie who lives across the hall.  I think we have the male Stephane and the female Stephanie's names selected to show a kindred spirit connection, but it becomes a bit confusing such as the film being spoken in Spanish, French and English intermittently.  Emma De Cannes who will be in "Mr. Bean's Holiday" this year plays Stephanie's friend Zoe to who Stephane is attracted.  This is an odd complication since it's never clear which girl Stephane wants; and he seems never to be able to make a decision.  Then you have Alain Chabat as the obnoxious Guy showing up at work and in bars with his one-track mind.  Chabat was nominated for the French Academy of Cinema's Best Supporting Actor award in 2000 for "The Taste of Others," but it's hard to see why with this one-note role and performance.  Overall, the film doesn't go anywhere.  Yes, it does make creative use of fantasy and absurd cinematic elements, but unfortunately they don't serve to tell a story.  At the end, I was glad the film was finally over.  Taxi 
 Wild Card is the best song on this cd.  The rest just didn't do it for me and I didn't care for the Latin flavor.  This cd was a mess.  If the rest of the songs were along the lines of Wild Card, I would have kept the cd.  This didn't say Rippingtons to me. 
 This book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough French to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory.  I found "French in 10 Minutes a Day" much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook 
 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 In a word...disappointing.  On phono input, the treble is fine, but if you're looking for any kind of bass, two dixie cups and a string would work as well.  If you're thinking of purchasing this item...set your expectations LOW 
 For the first 15 or 16 chapters of Sole Survivor, I was intrigued and interested.  I found myself, as I usually do, trying to visualize where the story was going and continuing to read to confirm what I was feeling.  When the story finally got to the point of enlightening the reader about the engineered children at Technologik, I found myself thinking, "I didn't think of that one."  The main part of the story that disappointed me was the last couple of chapters.  The story just ended when I felt the was more that needed to be explained.  There were too many gaps from being chased out of the cabin through the woods and then all of a sudden on the beach when the story ended.  It left me wanting to know more.... 
 What a bunch of high school hallway gossip! The author does not know the difference between white and albino! The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' WHAT?? A waste of my hard-earned $. Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published! 
 I am a direct relation to Grace Loveless Doze and I was offended by the book, as was many members of our family including her son, Clifford who is now 80 years old. This book portrays Grace out to be a fluzy and she was not. Just an unhappily married woman.   This book has brought disgrace to our family and a lot of  heartache to Grace's son.   Grace was a lovely person and well liked by the Doze family. Her mother, husband, son and relatives loved her and were horrified by her murder which is still unsolved today. Our family feels Dr. Goldberg is profitting money off of our family's tragedy.  
 Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie 
 I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.   When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a "buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly" promotion and Amazon prime, so my "refund" would be less than nothing.   That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair 
 Two stars is the equivalent of a D in school.  D is for dumb, as in the language used in this translation.  However, before it sounds like a personal insult to anyone, the author explains that a more simplistic and less poetic style is what he intended.  and besides, the guy reads chinese.  he clearly isn't dumb.  Nevertheless, i like the poetic style that other translators have used.  Sun Tzu's concepts are timeless, and they could hardly be seriously damaged by an unorthodox translation, but i personally find the poetic style more accessible.  the primary reason for this is its beauty.  beauty is more easily recalled than blandness.  it is easier for me, and many others i suspect as well, to remember beautiful language.  the purpose of beautiful language is to express the ultimately inexpressible.  simple "how to" language fails to do this because it lacks beauty and is utterly pragmatic...that is to say, it lacks a personality and is usually forgetable.  Sun Tzu's work, as my reading of it goes, is less of a 'how to fight a war' as it is 'artful expression of power-relationships'.  the title says it all: "the ART of war"  not "war for dummies"        (though, come to think of it, that would make a catchy bumper sticker).  Artful expression was sun tzu's ultimate intention, and the spirit i believe he held when compiling this work.  "plain english" does a disservice to this spirit of artful expression.  Societies have always suffered when the sublime is sacrificed upon the altar of clumsiness.  Go for the poetry instead. 
 Do you want to print photos?  CAD images?  How about a multi-page PDF?  Well, if so, then avoid this printer.  Yes, such simple tasks will not be possible.  It has so little memory (just a guess) that it fails on nearly everything I send to it.  As well, the same trouble with paper misfeeds, etc. you read about below are entirely true.      
 The premise of this story started off smartly. I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away. But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache.   I have read one other Case book I think, his "Kingdome Come" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I'm not sure. But what I am trying to say here is that 'Kingdome Come' was much better than 'First Horseman.' Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum 
 I enjoyed this film , but it has nude childern and I did not think it was needed in the story  
 I have only made 2 desserts from this cookbook, but they both turned out HORRIBLY.  I have never had problems following recipes, so I was surprised and disappointed when the first two recipes I tried turned out terribly (Chocolate Turtle Tart and Chocolate Decadence).  The Chocolate Turtle Tart was inedible, due to the caramel being hard as a rock.  When my husband (a professional baker) reviewed the recipe, he laughed b/c the caramel recipe was incorrect!  I served this at a birthday party and was very embarrassed. What a waste of time and money!  I was really hoping to love this book, since I am a true chocoholic.  Maybe I will try one more recipe.. 
 This book is a very good comination of two of the greatest works by William Faulkner.  The Sound and the Fury is carefully written using stream of consciousness refering to a sibling of the family.  Even the very last sentence can easily take the reader back to the very first sentence.  It is beautifully written, as well as As I Lay Dying.  As I Lay Dying is written in many perspective's of each person in the family.  The full story is obtained through reading through each person's mind and opinions and happenings.  A suprise ending adds to the punch of this book.  Both of these novels (combined into one book) are stories that critics and others seem to love, cherish, and remember for a long time 
 So my girlfriend made me read this book. I almost broke up with her  because of it. I mean, come on people! Nothing happens in the book, the cats who are supposed to help solve the "mystery" don't lift a paw, the whole thing is so bad and convoluted that at the end, the author has to explain to you all the things that happend that she couldn't manage to fit into the book somehow, so there was no way for you to even have any clue at all what was happening.  Look, I love cats. They're cool. This book made me want to kick cats and the author. Don't waste your time unless you like falling asleep in the middle of scenes that are supposed to be "action" or getting really angry that you paid for this book. (I didn't...my girlfriend loaned me hers. I gave it back. Good riddance. 
 Hi! I'm a pseudo-intellectual and I dabble in obscure Eastern mysticism, therefore I am superior to you. Did I tell you about poignant passage where Az'herlhabeld casts a disenchantment spell on Saturn's rings? Oh that's right, you probably don't know who Az'herlhabeld is because you haven't read the beautifully mystifying KABBALAH 
 I think I paid way too much for this extremely slim and small book.  This paperback book measures approximately 3 inches by 5 inches.  About 1/10 of an inch think.  I paid over $5 from Amazon.  The pages can easily be torn by a toddler or preschooler.  It's just way too small to read to several children at once.  Everyone is complaining that they can't see it 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 This is the first and so far only book on technical analysis I have read.  Though I will read at least a couple more.  This book doesn't appear to be the easy way to get started.  You get some techniques, though never enough to really make full use.  Explanations are started, then ended with the promise to get back to it later.  Not a good way to learn if that is the rule, and in this book it is.  Is Ms Brown just stumping for her web site or what?  But I am not so sure it is all her fault.  Maybe technical analysis of the stock or futures market is the problem.  Everything about it smacks of self delusion.  Going by this one book, and some reading of the subject on the internet, technical analysis is the astrology of the 21st century the way it looks so far.    You get various systems for deciding.  The advice to get three indicators that agree.  Why three?  Why not five, and why not explain which three work?  Ms. Brown gives analysis, and then adds little changes over the standard.  But there is no rhyme or reason as to why this change now, and another at a different time.  Just something to make it fit, and seem to work.  Then the advice to pick a few indicators, oscillators, work with them, learn them.  Seems to me you are simply using them long enough in a earnest manner to build up your own confidence in them.  Ms Brown when talking about combining moving averages, mentions Fibonacci numbers in picking your moving averages.  And then makes the comment you can use which ever lengths of moving averages you prefer.  Whatever you choose and are comfortable with.  Now I am sorry, but if this is really technical and has something behind it, there should be some that work better for some purpose versus others.  If not, I think we are back to self delusional confidence building.    At the very least, even if further study of technical analysis proves fruitful and worthwhile, at least for neophytes, leave this book alone.  It isn't much good for you.  The fact an earlier of Ms Brown's works was chosen to prepare candidates for the professional certification exam for the Market Technicians Association doesn't exactly encourage me in regard to technical analysis.    You do get a taste for TA, and some of the terms, with some explanation of the more common type charts etc.  But it is poorly done.  It does provide some info, which is why I give 2 stars rather than 1 star.   I am pretty sure you can do better.  
 This book proved a great disappointment. It contains nothing new, and completely fails to interpret either Daniel or Revelation. The author comes across as blinkered, bigotted and arrogant - a self-satisfied member of the 'elite' who gives the impression he will spend eternity smirking from his guaranteed high place in heaven at the rest of us, who will presumably be burning in hell! He is mistaken in thinking Daniel and Revelation only have any meaning for the present generation - didn't they have any meaning to those for whom they were originally written? His theology appears limited and narrow-minded. Don't waste your money on this book. A more scholarly and balanced view of eschatology is given in Craig C. Hill's book 'In God's Time' 
 "Winter Rose" is the story of wild child Rois and her sensible sister Laurel and their obsession with the mysterious and cursed Corbett.  I tried to like this book, it took me three attempts to read the whole thing, but I did! I just found that I didn't really enjoy it and found it difficult to get into.  For me, the language was beautiful, in parts, but the pretty metaphors, similes and adjectives got in the way of the story and at times I felt I was lost in the description and was desperately trying to find an interesting storyline.  The storyline was interesting but I don't think it needed to be so long and there wasn't really enough to keep me interested or encouraged me to wade through the description to find it. At points I felt the author used so much description to thicken up the storyline which was lacking.   The characters also didn't come across as very developed. None of them seemed to really have any flaws (apart from Corbett's grandfather) and I think this made them seem very two dimensional and distant, even the narrator, and I didn't find myself caring about any of them.   I'm a fan of fantasy but I think this particular story is a bit too mysterious for me, and I'm still not sure what happened in some points, this wasn't due to my lack of reading abilities but rather a lack of interest in what happened. It just didn't have me hooked.    I've not read any other of McKillip's books and I'd like to because I've read that this isn't her best so if you're a fan of her writing style I'd give it ago. But if your like me, and prefer a really strong story to very pretty writing you might want to give it a miss. 
 I love Bentley Little - ordinarily - but this short story stinks!  Not too much more can be said about it.  Boy meets dead dad in closed mall, dead dad wants boy to kill mom, boy doesn't kill mom, that's about it.  Save your money on the 'real' novels, and if you haven't read it, start with 'The Ignored' for a book that is worth the money 
 This book is a joke.  It is written by a guy who has followed Colin Powell around and has taken a lot of notes on what he has said.  He then put together a bunch of Powell's stories and comments into this book.  The "secrets" are not secrets at all.  They are common sense to most people.  After the first couple of chapters I realized that I was wasting my time trying to read each word and just went to the summaries at the end of each chapter.  It's all summed up there.  Powell did not contribute to this book, he was merely a speaker who fed the author enough information to pull this book together 
 I purchased this toy for my son because as a kid Tub Town was my favorite toy in the world!!  I was so excited for him to use it.  From the moment I took it out of the packaging I could see how cheaply it was made.  So cheap that even the suction cups do not suction for more then a few minutes.  The parts that attach don't fit properally and pop off!!  The plastic used is flimsy and showed stress marks before it was even used!  More then anything, the Tub Town product was a HUGE disappointment! 
 If it was possible to give no stars, that's what I would have given this book. Halfway through the book, and I had to put it down. I was bored silly! The books age made itself known with how all the women and men were portrayed, in ways you only see now in parodies. They were either controlling/manipulative/emotionless witches (both figuratively and literally), hardened prostitutes who would willingly sleep with whoever was stronger (even if the person was a murderer), or spineless. Why couldn't there have been some fairly well-balanced females like the ones we see in, I dunno, the Pern books or the Valdemar books? The only male character I even partially enjoyed was Mouse, known later in the books as The Grey Mouser. The Tarma to his Kethry, is just aggravating. ::snorts:: Not that Fafhrd would have much a chance to be anything else with the role models he grew up with. Perhaps it gets better later in the book/series, but I couldn't stand reading it long enough to find out. I am highly disappointed. This book was highly praised and reviewed at both sites I checked, and I can't see why. The descriptions of the lands are nothing special, and neither are the characters. I do not plan on spending anymore of my money on this series 
 I have had 4 various sizes of the skillets for 2 - 3 years now.  When I first got them I was so impressed....and thrilled that I finally had a quality set of skillets.  That excitement has gone away.  The non stick coating does not hold up over time.  I have babied this cookware and used only the correct utensils with them, and no scouring pads...only sponge and cloth as they recommend.  The non stick coating is coming off all but one...so far.  And of course foods now stick.  I don't recommend this cookware at all anymore.  I am now trying an 18/10 stainless steel set of cookware because I have had two 18/10 stainless steel pots for several years now that I LOVE.  I have not babied those at all, and they just keep going as strong as when I first got them.  I'm hoping the stainless skillets work as well as the pots that I love 
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 If you're looking for actual pertinent, insightful and useful information you will be disappointed (especially if you are an introspective, educated person with any degree of insight into your own functioning and disposition) 
 Perhaps this book appeared to be a futuristic medical thriller when it first came out, but now it seems like a bad 1950s horror movie.  The story involves brain surgery gone bad, with a mix of artificial intelligence and mind control.  The end of the story was very predictable and played out exactly as I suspected from the very beginning of the book. 
 My husband is Icelandic, and unfortunately this book was NO help at all... It's perfectly fine for the traveller, but in trying to live everyday life, conversing with new family members forget it. I would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section, something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand. If you are quite serious about learning this language I would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive Colloquial Icelandic.  For me at least, it's quite easier to understand, has complete grammatical charts in the back, as well as a fairly decent dictionary...  Again, if you are only learning for business trips and such, then this would be a good option... For those of us actually moving there, her book is not so good.. 
 If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.  All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.       
 Not the best movie we've seen but okay. I think that it was cheap made. I must say that this was the most borring movie even thoug there was lot of music in it 
 I have been looking for a 10-13" skillet/braiser that will remain flat on my electric flat cooktop.  After reading all the descriptions-page after page, I thought the Anolon Titanium would do the trick;however, after one(1) heat up on high to fry some hamburger, I had a pan that wobble terribly on its middle point(right where Anolon stamps its logo).  One can whirl the pan on this point with ease.  This product may be great for the gas cooktop, but do not get it if you want a flat bottom pan for your electric cooktop.  The handles stayed cool and had a good grip feel and balance for carrying and cooking 
 It is difficult to use words harsh enough to describe this product and this company. I have owned this software for about 80 days.  1. In 80 days of use this product has completely locked up or not opened twice. 2. I have called the 'support' line 4 times. The minimum time I was on hold was 40 minutes. 3. My initial 'support' period is about to expire and I now will have to pay $200 to get more 'support' 4. You have to buy additional software to get your data onto a palm device.  In summary: The product has locked up about every 40 days and the average hold time is 40 minutes when you call them.  Save yourself the grief - buy nothing or buy something else 
 The premise of this book is interesting, but the vehicle just doesn't work.  COME ON...Ms. Pettersson writes like a 5th grader.  I mean...blind date?!?! Disinherited ?!?!  GIVE ME A BREAK....  I mean, if the heroine is so bad-as* why hasn't she ever told her jerk of a "father" to go jump in a lake?!  So she can keep living on his dime and not get a job?  That way she can continue wandering the streets of Las Vegas every night.  Whatever 
 This book has way too many stereotypes and contraditions. In the same sentence the author tells women to date for fun, and to make dating a science experiment. Some of her advice is good as a pep talk and to increase self confidence, but the steretypes of men and the games to play are so unnecessary. Be confident and be real. If you are sincerely having fun dating, you will attract the right guys. Dismiss the second half of this book 
 This book has a bad habit of being weak and juvenille.  Very weak and ordinary. G 
 It wasnt all that bad. It had its moments. Brad Renfro (Bully), Dominique Swain (Face/Off), Keram Malicki-Sanchez (tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Emily Bergl (The Rage: Carrie 2), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), James King (Bulletproof Monk) and Jordan Bridges (Mona Lisa Smile, son of Jeff Bridges) star as camp counslers who have, well a lot of problems. Peter Stormare (Eight Millimeter) is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp. Emotions, relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way. James King (former model) looks good dipping in that lake..hmm. Renfro and Swain are so wrong for each other, they should be a couple in real life. Bergl is hot to the bone. Bridges is a bastard. Long is a hoot as a nerdy/geek type of characer and Sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others. Stomare is just weird, plain weird and the kids are brats. So if you liked Heathers, because Daniel Waters wrote it, then this is the movie for yo 
 I adored the Dorsetville series and kept waiting for funny happenings in this new book. It was pretty grim and spooky, and I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the other books by Valentine. (It looks like it could be a series.)  Exorcisms don't make light summer reading. I guess some could look at it as an adult Harry Potter-like book. The characters piqued some interest, but there was more time devoted to demons than to the characters' stories, I thought. 
 Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
 i am three quarters thru this book and no amount of money could make me finish it. what do people see in this writer? the dialogue is drivel, the characters implausible, and the situations unlikely, to say the least. so here somebody finds another gospel of the life of jesus. of course, this is accompanied by murder and skullduggery and an airhead opera singer (of all things!) heroine.  i'm sorry.  maybe if i were twelve, i'd think it was really cool 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 Thought it would be insightful but it was just dull and low-budget. 
 Spend your money for some other DVD. If you're interested in watching this movie, just rent it 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 I picked this coffeemaker up on the "Remanufactured" deal on Amazon. What I did not know was that "Remanufacturered" meant "obvious warranty returns jammed into a new box and resold".  The mugs were FILTHY. With DRIED COFFEE ON THEM. At least I HOPE it was coffee.  The mugs were both dented as if a car had run over them, yet the shipping box and product box had NO DAMAGE WHATSOEVER. Obviously they had been damaged before the "remanufacturing" process.  I'm dissapointed in Amazon for selling this trash 
 This poor hodgepodge of a book should have been structured to explicate the immigration policies of each European country, then describe the experiences of each country with its Islamic radicals (and their families).  Instead, there is just a spouting forth of this and that information in a way that does not help readers see which immigration measures are useful and which are negative.  The poor linkage of measures to experience deprives readers of any handle on how the European countries can improve the situation in the future.  The author seems to feel that the United States has a much better handle on immigration than the European countries; he fails to note that the U.S. also has inconsistencies and problems in how it handles immigration.  This book is an example of a first draft that should have received far better treatment during the editorial process.  It should have been improved beyond simply an emotional screed into a book that enables readers to see what policies seem most effective in integrating immigrants into the body politic and which leave immigrants as separate, poor, and disillusioned groupings vulnerable to exploitation by organizations trying to undermine the European countries 
 The book is pretty much useless. The one thing that will come in handy is its dictionary. The questions are badly written and confusing, and the answers don't actually vary very much. The reasons given for the answers tend to be little more than saying "The author implies -repeats multiple choice answer- 
 This story was honest to the Nth degree...in fact, a little too honest.  The author is rather scathing in a lot of her comments about Eastern Europe and Eastern Europeans, where she traveled to adopt two children.  Yes, that area of the world is not too well developed, but calling it "Trashcanistan," among other things, is, in my opinion, going a little too far, and hey, I'm not even from Eastern Europe.  The author's afraid she'll be robbed in the apartment she stays in.  The author is afraid of all kinds of things.  There's quite a list.  Add to that, the author bares her insecurities about adoption to a degree that she is just not too likable as a narrator.  Regarding one of her children, who spent years in an orphanage and related well and charmingly to all of her caregivers there, she states, "This little girl makes love to everyone she meets."  That's the most hideous, and inaccurate, given the context, statement I have ever read in a memoir about children, biological, adopted, or otherwise, in all of my life.  The baby in question was TWO YEARS OLD at the time the mother said she was "making love" to everyone she met, simply by being a charming little baby.  The mother narcissistically "can't bear it" that the baby doesn't initially single HER out as her most loved person on the planet, as if a baby that young could even figure out what was going on with so many adults coming and going in her life.  I read that passage, with my mouth hanging open in shock.  And that was only one of the disturbing passages.  This book is more shocking than a night at the Grand Guignol.  I can recommend this book to anyone studying a parent's narcissism, but that's about it 
 I thought i was getting a mix of some sort.....this is just an expensive condiment. 
 While I enjoyed the movies in this set that I was able to access, I had to return it because neither Evil of Frankenstein nor Curse of the Werewolf would play properly.  I should have been advised by the warnings of other customers who had similar problems.  Live and learn 
 This book was good for the first 40 pages but that's it. Hochschild gets across the interesting truth that some Americans work and don't spend time with their families because work is a reprieve from the stress of home and family life. This is really the crux of the book; the rest is mainly filler. Hochschild doesn't provide much more insight or scientific rigor and support to these observations. I agree with the above reviewer that the writing is quite poor: convoluted; however, I wouldn't even give the writing the compliment of being novel-like. The writing is trite and character placements a headache 
 Plenty of detail and typically PC. Written by a couple of liberals who bring us yet another re-hash of the "official" outlook on Oppenheimer as flawed god who strayed off the reservation as defined by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. Dripping with cliches and the the whole array of baggage that entails. Good as a source of information, decently written, but oh so tired. Why did they bother? Why should you 
 I only listened to one song on this album and I found their performance of 'Pavane, Opus 50' insulting.  I have never heard such a beautiful song transformed into such a disgusting piece of music!  I love that song's insrtumental compsition, but next time leave out the choir!  It insults the song!  It is a song meant to be played on an instrument, not performed vocaly! But the rest of the songs might be alright 
 This was a book that discussed art, and tried too hard to be a work of art itself.  Most of the characters were flat and unlikable.  The author takes us into three time periods, one melodramatic (the life of Chatterton), one boring (the life of Wallace), and one surreal (the life of Wychwood).  On the positive, I did learn more about Chatterton, and had more of a feel for what it would have been like to feel the way Romantics felt.  But all in all, I couldn't wait for this book to be over. 
 Samples of this CD suggested a nice mix of neo-grooves with fresh, unique vocals.  What I heard were uninteresting and predictable tracks, weak and (at times) unintelligible vocals.  Hoping to add Aya to my stable of neo-soul vocalist, e.g., Dexter, Larrieux, Badu, Scott, I found this CD better suited for the "used" sale CDs.  Another reviewer said this would make great ambient music, and that makes sense; I could put this on and forget all about it 
 This slim, poorly written, poorly illustrated, poorly referenced paste-up might have a few interesting tidbits, but it's so error-filled that it should not even be idly browsed. A few examples:  * "There is no official White House barber" (p 16). Don't tell Milton Pitts. * "Offices in the West Wing are usually ... windowless" (p 49). Huh? On Williams' own diagram, 3 executive offices are windowless and 16 have windows. * "The oval shape of [the Blue Room] inspired the shape of the Oval Office, when the West Wing was constructed in 1902" (p 21). In 1902 the president's new office was a rectangle. The oval-shaped ones were later additions. * He says Nixon filled in FDR's pool (p 49). Almost right: it's still there, just floored-over. * He calls the Eisenhower Executive Office Building by its former name, then says it's accessible by tunnel (p 45). It's not. There is a tunnel to the Treasury Building. * He gives a chatty but wrong history of presidential bowling lanes (p 113).  With so many patent errors and no references, the rest of his "info" has the ring of guesswork. (Williams has "written for the New York Times"? Written what!)  The book is lousy with fillers: A box on the colors in the U.S. flag. An entire page on HOW TO PUT YOUR HAND OVER YOUR HEART. Pages advising how to tell a joke, tie a tie, remember names. A list of some White House paintings - not photos of them, mind you, just a list.  The illustrations by Nancy Leonard are a computer graphic disaster. * She cannot be bothered to draw a round oval, but ends up with flat parts in the oval rooms, the south portico, the elliptical drives, and the Oval Office rug. Fireplace and furniture icons are grossly oversized and oddly angled. * Her colonnade pillars come in bunches between gaps. * Her graphic program apparently could not handle tricky angles in rooms, so these are represented by what look like potato chip outlines.  * She clearly relied on the Independent Counsel's West Wing map and uses that labeling (and mis-labeling). The famous press briefing room, therefore, is called "West Terrace Upper Level" without a hint of its actual function. * For decorative facing pages, she colors her floor diagrams to look like old-fashioned blueprints, but neglects to reverse the colors of the white and gray squares she used to make "holes" for doors in the wall lines, leaving a floor with weird, massive boxes all over it. * Other illustrations are worse than clip-art. The TelePrompTer diagram implies that the president stands on a glass screen.  Williams doesn't mention the East Wing, the third residential floor, or the sub-basements, apparently because these were not in the Zweifels' "White House in Miniature" book and so do not exist for him. For that matter, bills, vetoes, executive branch appointments, judicial nominations, treaties, and other stuff a president should know how to "do" aren't explained. (For example, can you veto a bill by phone? Don't ask Williams.)  A book like this could have been delightful. This one is vapid, ugly, and wrong 
 The fatal problem is this book is NOT current to the 97 Uniform Building Code, contrary to the advertised description. It is written for the 94 Code. Therefore, it is useless and dangerous for actual design and permit. This book gives a pretty good tutorial, but asumes the reader to be an engineer already and skips key explanations of the process, showing numbers in formulas without referencing where they came from, what they mean, or what units they are measured in. Too cryptic. The reference data is scattered throughout the book, and often doesn't have a cross-reference, so it took me over an hour to read each page of problem, due to hunt-and-peck for clues. The design examples are fairly good but hard to follow, and the problem questions don't have answers or process to check your work. The subject is so complex that it would be scary to formulate a real life problem. The author left out the seismic factors on foundation design, so the answers are very wrong in earthquake areas. The 97 Code changed greatly from the 94  Code, so you will be struggling to learn erroneous information 
 I'd heard good things about this book.  This was a quick read.  I was irritated by the main character's low expectations in life.  When I was done with this book I was like, "what was the point of that?"  Enough said 
 Watched the movie on DVD, loved it so much I immediately got on-line and bought the soundtrack.  One of the things I liked about the movie is the juxtaposition of ballroom music and hiphop.  The soundtrack for this movie about ballroom dancing does not have a single track of the ballroom music on it!  What's up with that? 
 An abundance of full-color plates and numerous black-and-white photographs made this book worth the modest price.  The text is awkward. It sounds as if English is not the author's first language and certain elements of carelessness in the writing suggest that the author was more concerned with the manuscript deadline than scholarship. Picasso's own words, appearing as blocked quotes in the margins are not dated, nor sources given. The reader is not able to chronologically trace the change in philosophy reflected in his words. The text also suffers from an inordinate number of typographical errors. Walther's poorly disguised gut reaction of disgust in describing some of Picasso's work may reflect the reaction his early critics felt in viewing some of his paintings. Walther uses words such as "horror," "grotesque," "misshapen," and "ugly," at one point writing, "Picasso wanted to destroy absolutely everything.&quot 
 this maybe against the popular opinions, but the book is thick on author's philosophical thinkings (and the author is obviously fond of) on how various things are tied together, but thin on the actual things that you can do, and what to do. You have to wade through bunch of such mommy and apple pie stuff to get the point, which is a a pain. On the other hand, if you have plenty of time, and want to take it to savor the good of either ruby or rails or their interconnects, maybe it is the right book. 
 I'm of the opinion that King's books rarely translate well into movies, and this is no exception. Some of King's work is fantastic,  but unfortunately, a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new. This falls into the latter category.  A novel about a novelist, and one who has a hard time finding inspiration: Please Mr. King, which college creative writing program did you steal this idea from? The writer's ideas showing up in real life: From whence do these fantastic ideas pour forth?  I won't bother to tell you the ending, because if you have the poor luck to watch the movie, you'll have already guessed it by the time you're half way through. It's all bad and hackneyed, from start to finish.  I will give Steven King credit for putting his fame to good use though. If anyone without Mr. King's fame and built-in fan base tried to sell a story this trite, their manuscript would never make it through the slush pile.   Maybe it takes a bunch of bad stories like this to turn out gems like the Gunslinger series, but it doesn't mean that we have to watch them 
 Mammoth is a quick and easy read, perhaps working as simple weekend entertainment.  As a pulp sf/action novel, it has a lot in common with Michael Crichton novels.  For many, that would suffice, but I found Mammoth to be disappointing.  There is very little hard science here:  the physics and philosophy of time travel are completely lacking, for example, supplanted by Rubik's cube hand-waving magic.  Paleontology is discussed at a level that might be expected from a children's museum; part of the story (that part that contains most of the paleontological information) is, in fact, written literally at that level.  But most disappointing is Varley taking consistently wimpy stances on the paradoxes of time travel, the corrupting influence of big business, science vs religion, and especially the rights (or not) of animals.  Mammoth provided a very good framework for Varley to take a stand on these issues, but he takes the middle ground, placating in every instance.  
 Bought mine sometime around Christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to St Thomas last week.  It died within 10 minutes of being in the water.  It was never more than 5' down while I was snorkeling. While I never tested the compass or thermometer against known "accurate" ones, it seemed to work well enough for my purposes.  Just keep it dry 
 Newt and William are going to write a new book.  It will be called an Alternate History of World War II.  In it Germany will win the Battle of the Bulge BUT lose the war.  Their next book will be an Alternate History of the Revolutionary War, in it the Colonies will win.  Then they will together write an Alternate History of the First World War.  In this stirring book, the ALLIES WIN, THE ALLIES WIN. What is the point?  Also read Sidewalk Sam below for a fuller explanation of this lousy book 
 This book was a bit typical for my liking. The setting was stereotypical only to be mixed in with bland characters, all told through a horribly punctuated journal of a tenth grader who seems like someone who should still be in middle school. Through this story Jeremy, our lead man, experiences the many things which high schoolers encounter. And what are these things? Why smoking, drinking, partying and sex of course! All told through immature eyes, making this book one which I did not enjoy very much.. 
 "The Book of J" is an attempted restoration and critique of the original source document of the Pentateuch. Bloom first introduces the proposed author of this book - an original and provocative ironist, a lady of Solomon's court, who has been totally misunderstood. The next section is a translation of the reconstructed book of J by Rosenberg, who has also authored a brief appendix about the translation. The following two sections include Bloom's commentary on the book of J, its narrative, personalities and themes. This is the silliest book on the Hebrew Bible that I have ever read. It is obnoxious, almost totally unsubstantiated, and replete with simple misunderstandings of the Hebrew text. Bloom's somewhat euphemistic admissions that he is neither a historian (12) nor a biblical scholar (41) are the only parts of the book that I agree with. He mocks religious Jews, Christians, the "abominable Jeremiah" (176) and, with particular frequency, J's God. To the unprejudiced reader the God of the Hebrew Bible is majestic, awesome, and holy throughout, nothing like what Bloom describes. The arrogant claim that the Hebrew Bible or its proposed substrate has been misunderstood for millennia by people devoted to it needs much stronger support than the speculation that Bloom provides. Among other things, we learn that God sits in the terebrinths of Mamre eating curds (12, 258) (a total misreading of Genesis 18), that God loves David but not Moses (41) (contrary to Exodus 33:11-12 and Numbers 12:7), that Moses becomes the founder of circumcision (245) (contrary to Genesis 17), and that God doesn't punish Moses for good reason (34), without much explanation. However, we are told that traditional Jewish and Christian expositors are "weak readers" (34) and "mad" (246). Virtually no secondary sources are offered for the assertions made in this book, though we hear occasionally about Noth, von Rad and Van Seters, among a few others. To his credit, Bloom mentions the opening words of Cassuto's commentary on Genesis (20), but fails to engage at all with Cassuto's stunning rebuttal of the documentary hypothesis. I recommend Cassuto's "The Documentary Hypothesis" as the perfect antidote to "The Book of J". Not a shred of archaeological evidence is offered in support of Bloom's assertions. Other literature of the ancient Near East receives no treatment. The content of the Pentateuch places its composition firmly in the late second millennium BCE, and its style and structure parallels other ancient texts of the Near East of that time - until it is mutilated and divided into its putative sources. For the relevance of this evidence to the dating and composition of the Hebrew Bible generally, I recommend Kitchen's monumental "On the Reliability of the Old Testament". Bloom and Rosenberg's transliteration is very inconsistent, and we're even treated to the non-existent form "v'yhi" (329). Rosenberg translates from standard editions of the masoretic text; but I think that for a task like his a critical edition would have been better. Readers looking for an introduction to theories about the composition of the Hebrew Bible should look elsewhere. In my opinion, the documentary hypothesis is speculative, unsubstantiated and discredited by archaeological evidence, and the hypotheses of this book add assertion to assertion, and speculation to speculation. I do not recommend it 
 This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story 
 I live in quite a large family also. And yes my family is bigger than this family. But my family and I'm sure many other people with large families will agree with me on this one, none of the "adventures" would really happen in a normal big family. I have 8 younger siblings and 7 older siblings and we are certainly not like them at all 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
 Not a bad idea, but there are already a million (maybe more?) Coltrane tribute recordings out there, so the bar has already been set very high.  The arrangements are what hold this project back.  I haven't heard enough of Richman's work to say that he's a bad arranger, but he has no business arranging these tunes.  He bit off more than he could chew, and really should've hired an accomplished arranger.  These are very challenging tunes to arrange, because they really need very little arranging.  The original material is so strong, that you better be a damn good arranger - and have a couple good ideas - before you start tinkering.  The result here is not Fusion, but Fuzak.  The tunes all have a lame LA milquetoast sound, as if arranged for Kenny G.  Rough edges have been smoothed and sanitized.  But, to keep things 'spicy', almost every tune has at least one odd-time signature measure!!  That makes it fusion, right?  Give me a break.   FWIW, my favorite recent Trane tribute recording is probably Conrad Herwig's 'The Latin Side of John Coltrane'.  
 While this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival, it does not function to transmit the IPOD via FM frequency.  It can hook to the IPOD, cradle the IOPD and charge the IPOD, but it does not transmit.  The product was made in China but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return.  While I could probably process back through Amazon and the seller, it is not worth my effort.  All in all -- a complete loss of cost and shipping for this product 
 Where are the files to work along with? He talks about crucial techniques but you can't follow along with them 
 I've never had such-a-slap in the face biased book presented to me for college curriculum. Very dissapointing 
 There are a number of wonderful photographs included in this book, but I think that the author at times dares to presume dialogue and events which may be less than accurate than eye witnessed accounts. It's not quite trash, but then again, it is not quite THE biography of Mr. Kennedy 
 For a former accounting professor, Masters gets the numbers all wrong in this book.  Using the logic in this book, Masters gets up to a 43% long-term annual return on real estate investments.  In CH5 where Masters describes the source of real estate profits, the author includes paydown of a mortgage loans principal as one of the sources.  In fact principle payments increase the amount invested in the property and reduces the return rather than increases it.  This is just where the errors begin.  Masters targets this book at neophyte small investers.  My advice is that neophytes who don't have a sound understanding of finance should stay far away from this book.  For anyone else it's buyer beware 
 This book is nothing what the name says. It has nothing to do with Judaism or the Jewish Bible. A sly way to try to get Jews to convert to Christianity. Stay far away 
 With the exception of "My heart will go on" by Celine Dion, Horner's soundtrack is not a masterpiece but a bunch of stinking skunks who are masked by a field of sweet smelling flowers.    For a soundtrack score it is not riveting and really lacks any emotional connection to the film.  Overall it is just really overrated and the hit single got played so much that the masses just fell into a typical zombie trance and went marching to the store to buy it.  This was after they kept returning to the theater to see a fictional tale of love built around a tragic, awful event.    It didn't stop them though; they could not get enough of seeing all those depictions of people freezing to death in the water.  Overall a below average soundtrack that road the coat tails of a hit single that was shoved down our throats for an entire year 
 This movie was released in 1969 which makes it thirty six (36yrs) years to this date, and there is still not an ENGLISH version. I was so "pi...pi...pi...pi...piss-off" when I popped in this DVD and .......... Movies are meant to be WATCHED not READ. Otherwise, this movie seems promising.  And Amazon, can you PLEASE put an alert on DVDs that are not in ENGLISH....especially foreign films. This would be a BIG help 
 1st you can't see any of the tattoos, the photos are blurry and the descriptions of the tattoos are either incomplete, wrong or just not there.  It was more like a copy of The National Inquirer on what the stars like to eat for breakfast.  It had nothing to do with tattoos or what they mean.  I was really dissapointed and wouldn't recommend it to anyone 
 After reading the author's callous account of how she and her husband decided to abort their first child after an ultrasound revealed that he had no legs, I completely lost interest in anything this woman has to say.  Anyone who so despises those with disabilities that she thinks they're better off dead shouldn't be advising others on how to rear them.  I read with horror as she ho-hum describes how her late-term little boy had to be cut up during the abortion--what a shame, she writes, that he couldn't make it through the procedure looking pretty enough for her to get a good look at him before his disposal.  One even wonders whether she would have offed George & Sam--if only their ultrasounds would have revealed that they were autistic.    Perhaps she discusses this issue later in the book, but I couldn't make it that far.  If these kinds of attitudes offend you, you won't either 
 This is a good book, but most are under the impression that Einstein actually CREATED the content of the book.  Einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest German and Italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory.  For instance, e=mc^2 was not created by Einstein, as so many people people. An Italian physicist came up with it. If you don't believe me check any encyclopedia.  Einstein suceeded in taking everyone's work and compiling it. This was helpful to the world of physics.  Unfortunately, this stuff is outdated, and Autodynamics has disproven many things that Einstein says in this book. When it came out it was already outdated. This was published in the 60s. Autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s (45 I believe). If this was published in the 20s or even the 30s, it would have been a good book 
 This is the second remake of the original French version from around 1970.  This one is the worst of the three.  The gags remind me of the Three Stooges movies.  They are overdone and drawn out to pad the movie to 90 minutes.  
 Please all this is far from Sam Elliot's better Westerns. See "The Sacketts', "Conagher", "The Shadow Riders", or "The Quick and the Dead". This is far less a believable Western. Few if any women did what this woman did let alone the whole storlyine reeks of trying to be modern, not authentic. Sorry but no character development in my book does not make a good movie. Not to mention these were not exactly the kind of characters I would want to see developed 
 George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys.  This whole flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped package wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package. Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be.  However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough. She still had the curves back then.   In addition to the above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did.  By the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is way better than the main feature. 
 This is a thoughtful book with lots of useful information on intuition.  The problem is that the print is so tiny, and I, being over 50 y.o., get eye strain trying to read it without a magnifying lens.  There are also  many typos, misspellings, misplaced commas, incomplete sentences, wrong  grammar, etc., that it reads more like an unedited first draft than a  finished product.  The material is worthwhile but I wish it could be  presented in a less physically painful format.  Clearly, the publisher did  not "already know what to do" with this text.  If it were more  readable, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars 
 I could not sit through this movie. The acting and screenplay are terrible. This film could be described as a bad made-for-tv movie at best.   I ended up fast-forwarding though the entire movie after the first 30 minutes and turned the player off before I reached the end. I couldn't take it anymore. This movie is one of the worst I've attempted to watch in a long time.    Not recommended.  
 The most disappointing thing about The News from Paraguay is the beginning, and not precisely because is a bad one, but because in the first chapters of Lily Tuck National Prize awarded novel,  there's a hint that  could have been better than it turn out to be. So I confess that  for a few pages (those that engage a reader with a book) I found  charming the decimononic  story of Ella Lynch, a beautiful widow living in Paris well beyond her means. That even when  Ella decided to follow hairy Franco -a paraguayan stud- not because his looks, not even for this foolish thing called love, but because  he smelled like luxury and power in a faraway land; I still found it a joyable read,  but right when she arrived to her privileged life of  "querida"  of the most powerful man in Paraguay and began to have one baby after another in tumultuous times,  The News from Paraguay became boring and I began to skip entire paragraphes until I got to a previsible end. Based on true facts, the life of a Paraguayan dictator and his irish  mistress; Tuck, who confessed that she never went and wasn't interested in ever going to Paraguay (i think she finally did) can't even get the spanish names right: Mauel, instead of Manuel, Rosaria, instead of Rosario; Iez, instead o Ins. What's the deal with the ? Maybe I lost something in my not so good english, but I still can't get why,  a so so novel like The news from Paraguay, can win a National Prize 
 Frist of all this is  an okay album don't get me wrong, but I bought it because Johnny Ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really isn't. Plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom, with two tin cans on a string: one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it. Catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again I'd probably just d/l essential tracks like I Can't Be and I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced Ramones album like End Of The Century or Pleasant Dreams 
 The book was interresting but  I find it interesting that the club referred to in the book is ony for peopole making 6 figures.Do they realy need the basic exercises that are in this book? I thought this was for people fresh out of school or those choosing careers far from their area of experience 
 I couldn't get past the first five minutes of this. Pfeiffer's Russian accent was so horrible, and her lines so bad, I decided to watch Rocky the Flying Squirrel instead, so I could hear Natasha and Boris have an intelligent conversation 
 Clock started losing time the first day. Great tasting coffee. No problem with the carafe. Unit stopped working all together after about 10 days. Returned it to DeLonghi & they promptly sent me another. Clock started losing time the first day. Great tasting coffee. No problem with the carafe. Unit stopped working all together after about 10 days. This could get real old... 
 I wasn't sure what I'd get but it turns out to be basicly an overpriced noteboo 
 This book is very basic.  Those with any training, experience, or knowledge of Project Offices will not increase their knowledge here.  For beginners, it is a good introduction chapter to allow you to know what you don't know and seek greater detail elsewhere 
 When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem. 
 I'm not a big Apple Computer fan, but I was very disappointed by this book. Covering the tumultuous period just before Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the book attempts to provide all the 20/20 insight necessary to explain the company's short-comings. Unfortunately, though, the book is so poorly written -- and doesn't at all hide the disdain the author feels for Jobs -- that it's nearly unreadable. Rather than tell the story in a linear timeline, the book jumps back and forth in a very confusing way. If you didn't already know the Apple story, you wouldn't know what was going on.   Also, considering all the success Apple has had since then (with the iMac and Titanium PowerBook), this topic is moot now anyway 
 I think the director needs prozac to direct this movie, the whole plot is so mess up, junior high student can write better story than this..what was he thinking. don't waste your money buying this movi 
 After listening to the previews of some of the songs on this website I have deemed this album "bad" or "not fly". I suggest you spend your money on arcade games or fountain soda at the mall. Or if you do buy it, spend your remaining change on some glue so you can at least listen to it higher than a kite 
 This book was primarily forms to use - very little actual information.  I was disappointed it was not more helpful 
 I bought this for a far-sighted relative, but it didn't magnify enough, and was distractinly blurry, so the gift wasn't well received.  I give this two thumbs down 
 this movie is so bad that i simply couldn't finish it. why this movie would be remade to renew the old 'prizzi's honor' is beyond my wits. this movie was just dumb and childish. totally ridiculous and shallow 
 Everything is fine. Go back to sleep. Nothing happened here, move along. The government is honest. The Warren Report was totally comprehensive and answered all the questions. Believe. Obey. Go back to sleep. Everything is fine.  I did actually read this book. I will give one thing to the author, he certainly did a fine job finding many of the conflicts and contradictions in the "offical" story. Too bad he He didn't explain any of them. It is a fine research tool in that way.   Unfortunately for Posner his attempts to "debunk" are wholly inadequate and unconvincing. In fact this book is so filled with nonsense and speculation it does more to BOLSTER the case against the "Oswald did it alone" story. If it is true that this was a case of the "lone nut" why would the explantions have to be so over-reaching and internally inconsistent? If it was a straighforward case, the the evidence should be equally straightforward and not so convoluted.  The authors "explanations" are unsupported by fact and at times you can see Posner reaching to the point of "I don't even need to prove it, it should be obvious"  If this is the best effort to prove the Oswald "lone nut" story I no longer have any doubt about the conspiracy theory. If the lone nut story was true there would be supporting evidence that was consistent with the real facts, all the facts and not just the ones cherry picked by the author.  Nice try Mr. Posner 
 This book was a little TOO wordy for my taste. I am sure to ALL the FANS of the Hick's absolutely love it, however I did not. That's just my opinion. I am off to the next book. I prefer something that is straight to the point and lewss fluff, if you will. 
 This book is not a good book at all.  The book has hardly any examples to help you learn the material.  It is full of problems at the end of each chapter, but it is hard to solve any of them due to the lack of worked out example problems.  The book is full of proofs of the financial formulas, which is a waste of time in the real world.  The book is hard to read and even harder to understand.  The only good use of this book is toilet paper and it wouldn't do a very good job at that either 
 I had great expectations for this book and got very disappointed, I don't agree at all with the other reviews I read before buying it.   There are some parts that are carefully explained, specially those ones people hoping to buy this book would find easy, this is, the introduction, even a installation process. Then, when dealing with the real thing; i.e. important shader concepts or HLSL syntax, things turn out not so well.  Again, some things are neatly explained and others are just there, with no way for the reader (without previous shader knowledge) to imagine where did it come from, or why, or how it is used. There are code examples frequently but not enough to cover what is briefly explained, if explained at all, so the line about "no existing knowledge of shader programming is required" is wrong.   The book comes with examples about a wide range of techniques in a cd that help get your hands dirty fast, although lack in theoric support, as previously stated. It makes it a good reference for shaders programmers to quickly check any technique you need info on.  I got doubly disappointed when I read another books that I'd rather have spent my money on, that cover the same as this book and much more, throughfully explained, and with examples too.   I would describe "Programming Vertex & Pixel Shaders" as an overpriced shader reference book that may serve well as complement to another in-detail shader book, specially due to its examples and shading techniques explained with code. But I specially *don't* recommended for anyone who is not already into the shading bussiness, as will probably have to buy another book to cover this one's holes 
 There is not a single word in this book that is true. DNA of kids today is no way different from the previous generations. This is absolute garbage and has no basis in any scientific or spiritual reality. Of any sort 
 These boots look good on the first wear.  I bought the black patent boots and after one, not so wild night, they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material.  If you need boots for one night, for that perfect outfit, these will suffice. 
 If you're looking for a book on technique, which I was, RUN AWAY!  This book is about the philosophy of making pots.  I found the title misleading; I expected something more concrete (no pun intented).  This is a cerebral book; it has its place, and I may learn to love it, but not today.  Today I'm just disappointed 
 This book is one goofy rumor after another.  With hardly any verifiable sources, Epstein goes crazy throwing out every possible conspiracy idea around.  He actually states that Hammer financed Al Gore's college education, and that the whole Gore family were his servants.  If you love the "X Files" you will love this book 
 while i was watching this movie i thought to myself, "am i going to die?  have i gone to horrible movie hell?"  you see i was trapped in a theater.  it's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause B actors are pretending they can act just because they're fat.  the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it's grossly bright outside and it's a sunday afternoon and you're in a car and you've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape.  in conclusion, this movie turns me into melting snow.  but i suppose there are worse movies-- (see my review on gummo) 
 Emily Stanton had the world at her feet - which is quite extraordinary for a young woman living in 1920's Australia. She has the opportunity to study at Cambridge, but turns this enlightened option down to marry Georges; a Scottsman who is competing in the Sydney bridge competition. Emily is enticed by George's life in Paris and is also eager to overcome the pain of indecisions which have been troubling her since finishing school. So, she marries him and moves to Paris.  But Emily's life takes a sudden dip when they arrive back in Paris; she finds her husband totally engrossed in his work and she feels completely isolated. She becomes close with one of George's friends, Antoine but is still uneasy about her new life. Emily finds herself travelling around the world to Tunsia where she may just find her purpose....  This is an excruciating book to read. The book's downfall can be marked when Emily and Georges go to meet his mother in Chartres; while exploring the cathedral there, Emily meets a priest... and in the whopping 15 minutes since they lay eyes on one another, she is breaking her wedding vowels and having her very first affair. The reason behind this sudden surge of lust is not explained in the writing, and while the encounter has huge repercussion's for Emily, the reader is left feeling that the heat of passion was merely a catalyst for the rest of the book; an unexplained catalyst which is very spontaneous, unbeliveable and quite frankly, stupid.   Honestly, dont read this book. Just, dont. There is hardly any internal monologue and the endless descriptions of everything but the characters thoughts and feelings leave them as one-dimensional, soulless and uninteresting. This lack of attention makes the reader very frustrated; especially when the character's have long-winded speeches which dont sound at all natural, more like lectures, and pop up out of nowehere, amidst pages and pages of boring and irritating descriptions of the settings.  The character of Emily is built up but falls extremely short in reality; while at school she apparently topped the class in History (atleast that's what Miller repeats over and over and over again. Its really quite hilarious after a while because anyone reading this novel can see Emily is an absolute dim-wit.  I really had to trudge through this novel, and try not to lose grip by hurling the book across the room and stomping on it. How this was shortlisted for any prize anywhere in the world is beyond me... its utterly horrid. 
 So, being a fan of all forms of literature, more specifically challenging[faulkner], pretentious[d.h. lawrence] and original[kafka] works, I was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what's considered Pynchon's most imporant work.  Important 40 years ago, perhaps, but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one.  Oh man, the radio station is KCUF, boy, that's incredibly clever, I bet it's, like, something spelled backwards.  I fully understand what Pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work, to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs, among other things, all while giving us a story with no particular plot, no moral, no message.  I can understand it, but it doesn't mean it's worth my time, I didn't even finish it.  I read about half and then just dropped it to the floor.  I've read in numerous reviews of Haruki Murakami's work that he's a latter day, Japanese, Pynchon.  I don't agree, Murakami's ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing, Pynchon is a hack 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Social neuroscience is an exciting and important topic of study.  This book does it a disservice.  This book is poorly organized and presents only brief summary of many fascinating ideas.  You might find something that interests you, but you're unlikely to find it in enough detail to get a clear understanding of it.  Honestly I expected better from Daniel Goleman and I was quite disappointed by this book.  Unfortunately I don't yet have a better book to recommend instead 
 when i published this edition of "releasing" back in 1997, it was a must-have for indie bands releasing their own music. because so much has changed in the past five years, this book is now totally out-of-date and out-of-print. please do not buy a used copy of this book! the book is mostly contact info for various independent music-related companies, and all of this info is outdated. the web does a much better job at providing this sort of information, so start searching. good luck! -gary hustwi 
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 This book says nothing. He brings you on a journey through nothing that will you unfilled. Don't read it 
 I purchased 5 of these for Christmas presents. I tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time. Number 1: This was dead in the box. So were numbers 2, 3 and 4. I didn't bother with number 5. Every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested. Speaking of instructions, they tell you to "make certain the light is off before attempting to charge." There is a rubber button that doesm't click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is. Real junk, says "hummer", made in China and all five are going back 
 Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN STANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I just heard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . I cared little about any of the characters, and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste . . . the ending also didn't do much for me, as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly, I did not particularly "buy" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn't  all that believable. 
 I was anticipating loving this book.  I am an Irish Catholic, from Boston, and a fan of the Kennedy legacy.  Forever Young does not tell you anything new.  The author is a megalomaniac and it comes through loud and clear in his writing.  He credits his father and himself for many things that occur in JFK's and JFK Jr.'s lives.  Another reviewer wrote how they were appalled about the way William Noonan treated his mother.  I could not agree more.  This review seems to be more about the author than the book about JFK Jr.  That seems fitting, since the book is really more about Billy Noonan than the person you are interested in learning more about, JFK Jr 
 If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book 
 I picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title, but what I found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development. The ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved. I was disappointed. 
 This novel was a selection of my book club and as such it was a letdown. While you could classify the book as a "good read," so is a lot of mass market fiction. The characters are not well developed, and the author doesn't portray them subtly or fully enough for you to care about them. The plot as well as the writing is cliche-ridden, and the ending is pat. It is clear early on that the sisters will mend their relationship, find true love, and all will work out in the end. If you are looking for a recent, well-written book about sisters with more interesting plots and characterization, and a nice dose of humor, try Case Histories by Kate Atkinson or Rise and Shine by Anna Quindlen. A second-tier Anna Quindlen book is sharp, funny, and better written than most premiere efforts by other writers 
 I was looking for house plans that had the major rooms on the front of the house overlooking a view.  The title led me to believe I would find that type of home in this book.  I did not.  Also, most of the plans were very complicated with multiple roof angles and expensive building items 
 This is not the best version available of this fairytale...Stephen Carpenter's is much better.  In this version, the illustration and text don't even match.  The troll is described as having a nose as long as a poker and eyes as big as saucers...but the troll in the pictures has a bulbous nose and unremarkable eyes.  I don't know if it's an exact translation from Norwegian, but the grammar is occasionally ackward.  The metaphors in the speech given by the biggest Billy Goat to the troll have to be explained to a younger audience...which isn't bad in itself but contributes to the uneven flow in the text.  The pictures are good, too bad the writing isn't 
 Have used these recipes. she and her recipes are authentic , and well reviewed 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 The book is well-written.  Most parts of it I can agree with.  But there is a crucial mistake in Parson's message --- oneness likes to play separation.   I can say clearly that oneness does not play separation.  Duality/ego is simply a mistake/illusion caused by mind-evolution.  Saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion.  Also, his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the "mercy" of something, and this is clearly very dualistic.  Without ego, both doing and not doing are actions of oneness, to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake.  There are many illuminating sentenses in this book, but be aware of the neo-advaitan trap.  In my life, it was understanding, especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come to oneness.  The one who is doing the understanding is still oneness.  There is no duality in doing and not doing.  At right this moment, you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop.  Of courses, you make choices in daily life.  If you really understand what is meant by "nond-duality", you will not make such statements such as "there is no choice".   
 I am extremely dissapointed in this book.  Yes, some of the information was interesting.  However, there were no realistic suggestions for improvement.  As far as the homeless shelter in NYC(I didn't know mother theresa made NYC her stomping grounds), it may seem frivolous to put an elevator in a homeless shelter.  But hey guess what?!  Big surprise, some people that are handicapped are homeless too.  So I suppose they can just wait outside while a friend runs in and gets them a cup of soup and a roll.  It seems to me that Phillip K Howard is not familiar with people with disabilities or he would be singing an entirely different tune.  Physical and mental handicaps are a fact of life, and instead of putting them in institutions, hiding them away, or perhaps even enforcing mandatory sterilization(ok I may be exaggerating a bit there).  It is a fact of life, all "men" are created equal in the eyes of the law, and all of us are given the chance for the persuit of happiness.  If Phillip K Howard had his way, we would be without laws protecting the handicapped, mentally ill, and indigent members of society.  And yes, they need protection under the Law.  Because if they are Not protected, people take advantage of or ignore the rights, needs and wants of an important group in our society.  We all deserve the right to have a chance to contribute to society.  So lets not have another wheelchair bound person drag themselves up the steps of a courthouse so he could appear for a trial.  I guess Mr Howard missed that particular annecdote.  I give this book 0 stars, if I am required to give it any, then make them negative.  
 George G.M. Jones knows not a thing about real history. Claiming that the Great Library of Alexandria is where Aristotle took his knowledge is ludacris because the library was built by Ptolemy II. The Ptolemic line was the successor line in Egypt. Alexander, himself was crowned pharaoh by the people because they saw him as a liberator of Egypt. The priests of Egypt viewed him as the son of Zeus. These priests were of the god Ammon who were told at his oracle. The Egyptian Mysterey System was a creation of white men and is a proven hoax. The first Greek philosophers most likely had some knowledge of Babylonian and Egyptian thought they added reasoning, something none existant in Egyptian or Babylonian thought. Even saying that ancient Egyptians were all black is wrong, as the people of Egyptian constituted a mixture of races. They were black and white. They were in fact Semites, like the Jews and Arabs, people who are Caucasian. Skin color alone does not tell a man's race. An Indian from India is in reality Caucasian, making him closer to Europeans than the Japanese or Chinese. Even most the languages of India and Iran are Indo-European, while the Basque live in France and Spain but speak a language isolate. If the Greeks stole anything from anyone it was the Phoneicians and their alphabet, something that is the ancestor to the Greek, Latin, Etruscan, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets. The name Kemet was a reference to the black soil of Egypt. Today it is called Misr anyways.  
 I've tried for the fourth time to read this book. For the fourth time, I had to give up half-way. This book is just too dense for my simple mind.  I am sure that it contains more substance than most books on writing (hence, the generous two stars), but the packaging and, maybe, relevance compelled me, once more, to use the time I would on it to some other book more suitable for my Philistine tastes 
 About the only good thing to be said about Boston is that they aren't Rush 
 The story started off OK with the first two short chapters.  Then it falls apart.  The template is used but isn't filled out.  The love interest isn't, the bad guys did it but we don't have a clue how the good guys know that.  Getting into the clutches of the bad guys was done by following the script from the (imaginary) Scary Movie series for action fiction.  Getting out of the clutches of the bad guys relied entirely on the stupidity of well-trained mercenaries (who could not have been trained to the level of Scoobie Do if they were really that stupid).  There were a few interesting tidbits on history and historical paraphenalia, glaciers, old planes but the biology was 70's.  A very disappointing read 
 I have owned the bed and it is very DANGEROUS for a child. I am stunned that this product is still on the market. while it is very cute, and fairly priced you hardly get what you pay for. My daughter loved the look of this--- her first "big girl" bed. that was until it fell to pieces with her in IT! The metal rails that are to hold the bed together, and the matress in place, are not properly planned out. If you can even manage to get this bed built--- which is difficult, much more so than it seems at first---- the metal support bars fall out when the child gets into the bed. it is flimsy, poorly designed, dissapointing, and DANGEROUS. delta should be ashamed 
 While the underlying plot had potential, the story dies under its own weight.  There are too many characters (the first hint of trouble is the multi-page listing of characters at the front of the book).  This leads to too little time devoted to character development and too much bouncing around as we follow the many characters around the globe.  The dialog, is terse, contrived, choppy and generally devoid of emotion.  Having loved the Dirk Pitt and Brad Austin line of books from Cussler, I had wanted to like the Oregon Files as well.  Unfortunately, I found Sacred Stone and Golden Buddha to both be underwhelming.  
 We used this book about four years ago and found it very helpful in providing the basic information about schools for our oldest son.  So, when our youngest started pondering the college choice, we ordered this edition thinking it would again be helpful.  Were we wrong!!  This edition is very unreliable.  I am sure that Stanford would be pleased to know that although the class of 2009 had 20,195 applicants with only 2,426 admissions, their selectivity rating is 89!  And with a freshman class of 1,633 they have a total undergraduate enrollment of 1,858.  This is an obvious error, but how many of the other schools, maybe not as well known, have been misrepresented by this guide?  Princeton Review needs to send us a refund 
 I found this book to be very basic and lacking details of the actual events that brought this company down. One minute you are reading about the genral morale of the office then all of a sudden there is a reference to "cooking the books" or something to the effect that this company is going to fall like a deck of cards. No where do you get the details of the actions that actually took place.If I wanted fluff I could have just watched some TV news stories on the company 
 Any non Greek Orthodox person should take great caution in reading this book as it is in no way a definitive book on The Orthodox Church.  Where Ware excels in explaining a very condensed history of The Orthodox Church he loses all credibility by throwing in Greek Orthodox propaganda.  Please note, The Philokalia and The Jesus Prayer which are mentioned multiple times in this book are not widely used in the Russian Orthodox Church. Somehow he exemplifies the troubles of the Russian Orthodox Church under communist rule but barely discuses the widespread corruption in the Greek Orthodox Church.  He almost goes to the point of saying that the `locum tenens' aren't part of the `real' Orthodox Church.  Many would argue that these are the "True Orthodox Church." Chapter 16 "The Orthodox Church and the Reunion of Christians" is nothing more than an editorial.  His support of the Anglican Church and his distaste for the Roman Church is nothing more than ecumenism.  The truly sad aspect of this book is that it is one of the only English written Orthodox books on the market.  Hopefully a less biased book will be available in the future 
 Billy Collins' work is shiftless, mundane and irresistably dull. His wit lacks humor and the reader, (assuming he/she is an avid poetry reader) should be unimpressed by the second poem of this book. The voice that the reader should hear while reading this monstrosity is the voice of a 6th-grader with a college-level vocabulary. There is no spark in Collins' writing. There is no life in this work. And if that is what it takes to become America's Poet Laureate, I will never read nor review another again! If, in fact, you are craving poetry with Outlaw flair and a touch of Hunter Thompson, I suggest you read "European Confession" by Timothy Edward Jones (ISBN: 1-4137-2867-7) 
 The language in this movie was very inappropriate for family viewing and I would not recommend it to anyone.  I did not watch the entire movie because it never seemed to get any better 
 I'm not sure why anyone would want or need a PHB2... I mean, come on.  The whole reason 3.5 came out was to make money with little regard to how to better the game, and this book follows that example very well.  The content is mostly all fluff, about the only thing redeeming about this book is the cover.  
 I wish I had not bought this. Instead I suggest the DVD "Go Paddle" and the books "The Kayak Companion" and "Kayaking Made Easy" 
 I got this record just resently and it plain out sux!Their old stuff is the best!!!The cd has only 3 rocking songs and that's it.Do yourself a favor and buy their singles album.This is so not worth the money 
 I could honestly say, that the time this band was concieved, I did not like them at all, that was grade school people. But dumbfounded me decided back in I think it was 87 or 88, whatever it was bought Girls, Girls, Girls, boy what a let down that was I must say. I had a friend that idoled them, and I could not handle it, I had to put him out of his misery, just kidding, but I sure let him have it many times over. I just can't get into Vince Neil, nor the walking disease Tommy Lee, they both nausaete me too death with their perversions. And as far as the music goes, just pure garbage, fresh from the pile of leftovers from the cruddy hair band 80's. I would have to say, I would have a better time smacking myself with a hammer several times and get permanent brain damage than to happen to listen to these songs all over again 
 I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
 We purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the Disney princesses.  Even though we purchased it as a "play" bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child.  We immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be.   It's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably wouldn't last long anyway.  I recommend you look else where for your child's princess dreams 
 As other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings.  It may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game.  Calling it a "racing" gauge is ridiculous 
 I was given this book to read by a close family member who loved it.  I was extremely bored with it.  In order to enjoy this book you really need a good understanding of Politics, and each party's view over the years.  The author spends a lot of text covering the era of the Vietnam War, which I am not very familiar with, and so half the time I felt completely.  The book does get somewhat better towards the end when the key character is in present day, and running for election against a backhanded competitor.  (This book does not give you any warm and fuzzy feelings toward politicians).  I was extremely glad when I finished the last page.  I would not recommend this book unless it was to someone who had an interest in and deep understanding of politics 
 This book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships.  Heinlein is so different here than in his good books (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers, Door into Summer, or Orphans of the Sky) that I wondered who actually wrote this awful work.  It seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti-woman. The basic premise is what would happen with a man's brain in a female body.  Maybe a good concept, but it is terrible in application here.  I just hated this book. I was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work. Please consider avoiding this work.  Perhaps every writer deserves some grace, but this work is almost beyond redemption.  Maybe Heinlein was ill while writing this, or maybe his editor was on drugs?   
 this cd isn't that great. just about all of B.I.G.'s raps are recycled. Just a couple of songs that have new verses. Whatchu want is the only track stands out. Spit you game, it pretty much a sad remake (my opinion) of notorious thugs ft. bone. and the other is.. it has been said and it doesnt have B.I.G. in it at all. use caution if you think about buying this albu 
 This author has one heck of a writing style. It's all over the place!  He appears to be a well informed guy, but he's very hard to follow. He uses lots of dashes, parentheses, and notes about other chapters. Plus, there are many overuses of words such as "insofar" and "per se," which disrupt the entire flow of reading. It is not what I expected at all and am pretty disappointed 
 I don't know if it's the "worst ever", but it contains serious errors.  Some are possibly typos, but the majority are wrong math, wrong analysis or--worst of all--wrong concept.  A disaster for the beginning student.  See for example the solutions to example Free-Response Questions 2(b) and 3(b) given on page 151. 
 Well, it appears I'm one of the only ones to dislike this book, and it's by my favorite author, too!  The only good part about it was that it starred my two favorite people *ahem* characters, Tony Hill and Carol Jordon. There is no real mystery, as the killer is revealed immediately. Despite the opinions' of others I didn't find the book particularly scary, either.   The best part of this novel was when it was over, so that I could start The Last Temptation, the third, and, in my opinion, most amazing, Tony Hill/Carol Jordon novel 
 I really didn't enjoy the movie, but  I had to finish it.  The hypocrisy of Faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so-called fundamentalist that I know, but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying.   This movie presented a very perverted view of Christianity.  Though there was alot of talking about Jesus and saying His name, it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually KNEW HIM and spent time with Him.  When Mary gets a revelation from something she believes is Christ that opposed the actual Word of God, she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision.  Christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against His Word.  No one actually reads a Bible in the movie.  Consequently, most made many life-damaging decisions.   I hated the "reality" of the movie, but it has challenged me to actually spend time with Christ and learn about Him. I shudder to think that I could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what Christianity truly is.  
 This is a book in the genre of Mein Kampf and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  An unapologetic smashmouth racist tome that revels and celebrates hatred and fear and is sure to provide supremacist groups with a wonderful volume to treasure and keep on the shelf.  I feel sad when I see that this book will clearly be used to indoctrinate and "teach" people how to hate and fear other people.  Raspail's central thesis is that white people should be nervous because there are a lot of non-white less "desirable" people out there who are coming to peacefully take over their fat, rich lands.  He uses every negative, racist term to describe nonwhites calling them: "turd eaters" and emitting foul stenches etc. etc.  In short, everyone other than whites is a subhuman animal that could be tolerated as long as it doesn't come too near.   The book is a mean spirited, paranoiac Malthusian nightmare of being over-run by "the other" (where the other is a bunch of starving Indians on a convoy).  Fear pervades every page of this book and one finds one actually pitying the revoltingly racist Mr. Raspail simply because of the fever pitched fear that must course through him.    Having read Raspail's odious and despicable work, I find myself wonder what would happen if an ice age descended on Europe and obliterated "Western Civilization" there. How would the North Africans react to flotillas of poor, emaciated Europeans showing up on their relatively warmer shores ?  Would they adopt the attitude that Raspail longs for and attack them or....?  It's clear that Raspail is an imaginative writer. What worries me is the extent to which his work will be used to excuse, shelter, justify and defend pure murderous evil.  
 I have two of these chargers that I bought directly from Kodak for about $10 each. Each of them came with 4 AAA batteries which do not charge at all straight out of the package. One of the chargers has become defective after somewhat heavy use. Battery charger technology is not all that complicated but Kodak doesn't seem to have mastered it yet. No wonder they were practically giving these away. I'd avoid purchasing these now at any price 
 I was disapointed when I saw the cover but figured the information would still be helpful.  I was wrong.  The list of toxins covers things not manufactured since the 1970's!  It also has very minimal modern knowledge of PCOS and other fertility complications.  Skip this book it needs to be retired.    Try The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy 
 This would have been a much better title for the book.  Schuerholz offers little insight into what he actually does; instead, he gives vague generalities that usually serve only to remind us of how good a GM he is.  Even the title is being subtly arrogant.  'Baseball's Winningest GM'...what does that even mean?  Most regular season wins? Most division titles?  Certainly not most World Series titles, and this is the ultimate definition of a winner.  I applaud what Schuerholz has done, and this book does have some interesting anectodes about players through the years, but more often than not the book is used only for Schuerholz to toot his own horn 
 This book is nothing more than the authors' rants against U.S. politics, and its alleged ties to the criminal underworld.  The book is laughable in the extremes the authors go take to link almost every U.S. President since JFK to the criminal underworld.  The worst part is that most of the so-called evidence for these links is from "anonymnous" or "un-named" sources.  Do yourself a favor, and read something else 
 I am a seasoned Java developer, but not an experienced Web developer and I bought this book because I wanted to bring myself up to speed on Web development using Spring; but I am sobered now. The book was obviously quickly pieced together from disparate material. Nobody seemed to have worked the examples through before releasing the book; these examples are inconsistent, and I lost a lot of time debugging and searching for the reasons why it did not work. E.g. on page 62 there is a diagram of what you should get when you follow the instructions; but if you follow the instructions, you do not get it. (resp. it makes assumtions about what is availble in the Web server without telling so). If you are an experienced Web developer, you can probably make up the missing parts by yourself; if you are not, you spend a lot of effort searching for missing parts of the puzzle, instead of learning the thing you wanted. Its a pitty the autors or editors did not spend the time in order to tediously check the content and make it consistent throughout; I think it could be a good instructional book (despite containing too much vain praise like ".. are highly configurable and extensible ..." instead of hard facts (e.g. useful examples of extensions); so it is only a text book for those already knowledgeable 
 Tim Riley's book on Dylan starts fresh. He provides one of the best appreciations of Dylan's voice I have read. OK so the guy has a fresh point of view. Then he weighs into Dylan's early work with gusto. Riley appreciates Dylan's socio political protest in the image of Woodie Gutherie and also gets into what he imagines is drug fueled creativity up to 1966. He finds a drug behind every bush though which is possible but misses the multiple layering of Dylan's work. Then like the folkies who dis Dylan at Newport he starts to turn sour on Dylan during the post-66 period and gets nastier as the book moves on. Until finally in the Epilogue Riley becomes the master of mean invective against Dylan and everyone, except Wilco? Oh yeah, they are singing Woodie Gutherie songs to new tunes - right. There's the connection. My advice - borrow the book, read until Blood on the Tracks and quit. The rest will spoil your day 
 I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder 
 This film starts with an event based on a true crime. A talk radio show host in Denver was killed by an American Nazi. (This event inspired the "Talk Radio" play and film.) This film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region. No mention of their economic status; are they losing dollars and population, small businesses, etc. Instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him! This seems too exaggerated to believe. Federal agents are aware of this but don't want to act yet. Their agent is sent back to get more information. There are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas. The film doesn't explain what created them. It shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions. No real names, of course.  The Federal agent meets to report to her higher ups. Then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities (based on real events). Most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group. (The FBI put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s.) This Federal agency doesn't interfere because they want more information on their aims (and their leaders). More terrorism is planned: dynamiting a courthouse, attacking a power station, etc. The terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day! Kathy finds a secret list of "friends". This is quickly copied with a camera. The Federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them. Gary meets with the leader (who arrives in a helicopter!) And shows documents that say Kathy is a special investigator. Is Kathy being served up as a sacrifice? Gary and Kathy travel to Chicago, where an assassination is planned that will make Gary the fall guy. (Another Lee Harvey Oswald?) A second "lone gunman" shoots the politician in front of a building. Gary fails to shoot, and won't ever try this again.  Costa-Gavras gained world fame with his 1969 film "Z". A few years later his film about rebels in South America was popular. His later films have seemed mediocre. A better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does; better pacing could help. The threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film (e.g., Timothy McVeigh). Those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts.  A better film today would show the bad results from "NAFTA" and "Free Trade" in harming most Americans economically. But Hollywood would never allow a film about this "war on the middle class". The word `nafta' in Greek and Arabic refers to `petroleum'. NAFTA is a symbol for the policies designed for Big Oil. It is like George W. Bush calling his policy "Operation Iraqi Liberation". 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 Pages 1-58 are two new stories.  The rest of the book are stories that were published years ago and slightly modified so that they could have a 2005 copyright.  If you are widely read, 200 pages of old stories will be a major disappointment.    Also, I wouldn't judge any of the individual authors based on what is in the book.  The editing appears to be significantly different than what is normal.  Try the anthology "Dates From Hell" instead of this one.  Much better writing and editing 
 I think I'm one of the biggest Hiatt fans ever and  I used to consider him God of songwriting. With this one he povd to me he's human. I just don't think it's up there with "Bring the Family" or "Stolen Moments" or "Walk On", or Beneath This Gruff Exterior." Sounds like he may have originally decided not to release these but changed his mind. Maybe it's me but I don't get it 
 This quick-read is a cheap thrill. It has some eloquent prose and an interesting premise; however, the story as a whole is marginal and actually quite banal. The author seems almost desperate to convey "realism", but relying on photographic descriptions of sexual acts and equally graphic renditions of sadistic brutality are simply not enough to make this story exceptional.   The protagonist, Frannie, is "too constructed" to seem real. Her extreme cynicism is perhaps refreshing at times and her linguistic ponderings are often quite amusing, but overall her personality is meatless. The lover/detective Malloy is a tired police cliche with a knack for some extreme sexual precision. Frannie's student Cornelius shows some potential as a character but quickly disintegrates.  The ending is quite over-hyped and actually rather disappointing. Blood and gore and a meager "explaination" - wow, what a surprise...  Overall, Susanna Moore shows us in this book that she can be clever with words; however, her attempt to portray gritty reality comes across as merely desperate for attentio 
 Like most people, before I spend money on a DVD, I read all the cover descriptions first.   The back cover starts with a breathless announcement about Dan Brown's book. Then it lists a series of questions by the book's detractors.   Based on the cover description, I honestly thought this DVD was going to be a reasoned "second opinion" regarding the historical information that Dan Brown uses as part of his novel.   I had no idea that the DVD was actually just a rehash of the same theories minus the mystery-thriller context. I'm guessing the marketers deliberately meant to ensnare people of faith into thinking they were purchasing an opposing view.  This DVD should be called: "The Da Vinci Code," Part Deux 
 I like Ludacris. Don't get me wrong.  But this album is kinda annoying.  The blow it out yer ass song is hard to listen to and repetitive.  The splash waterfalls song is also really redudant, if you heard it on the radio as many times as I did, you might agree.  He just talks through too much of this album... instead of rapping.. the beats are kinda weak and repetitive.. there are 3 good songs on this one: Diamonds in the Back, We Got, and Eyebrows Down.  The rest of them are kinda annoying.  But like I said I DO like Luda.. just get red light district or word of mouf instead 
 My first Nora Roberts' book....with only be persistent did I complete the book....found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline...shallow characterizatio 
 Looking at the reviews here, it seems that a lot of people can relate to the author's experiences. Basically what that tells me is that there is a lot of bad parenting going on these days. For example, when I was growing up, I never talked back to my parents or slammed my bedroom door in protest to something they did or said. In fact, I never even THOUGHT about it. If I had ever done such a thing, I guarantee you it would've never happened more than once!! Mind you, my dad was not a cruel man and not really very strict, but being disrespectful (like the kids are in this book) was something that was simply not tolerated.  My mom recently told me a story - the first time my parents took me to a restaurant when I was little and I started screaming and carrying on like most kids do, my dad took me out to the parking lot and beat my a**. After that, they never had any problems with me in public again. I guess there's nothing like a belt to make a misbehaving kid see the error of their ways :)  When I first started reading this book, I thought some of the stories were pretty funny, but in a sad sort of way. As I kept reading, I began to think that this guy was simply unfit to be a parent. Hint: If your kids act this way, you might try a little thing called discipline instead of letting your kids walk all over you 
 I bought this  book hoping that it would investigate today's financially status oriented world. In this task the book starts off quite well reviewing Nixon's visit to Russia.  The biggest problem I have with this book is that it drifts off the subject to look at how status has  been covered by other authors and artists.  To me, the book, particularly with its enumerated layout, reads more like someone who's written a ph.D thesis and desperately wants to cover those things that  someone reviewing it would be impressed to see, throwing in a few graphs for good measure. Unfortunately to the layperson it is very hard to get through. For example at the end of the section on philosophy it reads "To heed the misanthropic philosophical council we must surrender our puerile obsession with policing our own status..." Yeah, right!  De Botton doesn't really seem to be writing for the reader, more for himself, and a very intellectual audience, who probably will nod and agree with everything he says, because they too are impressed they know so much too.  It's a shame that the book has turned out how it has as I think the subject would have made an entertaining read if written in a different style.  I was going to give it one star, but De Botton has clearly researched his subject well whic earns it an extra star, but don't expect to learn anything you don't know already 
 This was a good enough compilation in its day, but it has been replaced by the far superior Sounds of Summer collection, released in 2003.  This CD only gives the listener 20 songs and has a downright meager running time of 49 minutes.  SoS has 30 songs and runs for over 70 minutes.  The only songs found here and not on SoS are "409" and "Catch a Wave".  Add this to the fact that Sounds of Summer is frequently on sale, and there's no reason to go back to this outdated collection 
 At one point in time I considered myself to be LKH greatest fan.  I've been reading her books since junior high school.  I own everybook she's ever written, the entire Anita series, Meredith, Nightseer, Death of a Darklord, Strange Candy etc... I sat and read alot of the comments about her and I decided to add mine.  LKH is seriously slipping.  I mean honestly.  I have never been so dissapointed in my life as when I read her last book.  What happened to the old Anita?  The kick a#@, chick who saved the day and slaughtered the bad guys?  The Anita that mad you wanna drop everything because you just had to find out what was next? LKH's books used to be awesome they were perfect but somewhere she lost it.  As Anita progressed she just became sluttier and sluttier and then on top of that she's falling apart.  I mean Jesus does she have to sleep with everyone in the book?  A little sex is good, but when it completely takes over leaving no room for plot, it becomes ridiculous.  As for LKH and her snooty comments, the sex crazed Anita is not what started her fan base.  The smut she's writing now did not get her where she is today.  Maybe she should remember that.  I strongley recommend that if you want good reading buy her earlier books.  If you must read the new ones, go to the library because they are not worth the money 
 Doplh Lundgren (Silent Trigger, Peacekeeper) stars in, yet another action thriller. This time Lundy tackles the role of a man who is hired to protect a beautiful model who is being stalked and threatened by a evil mad man. Lundgren and the baddie go head to head but there's one problem with Lundgren...years ago he had an accident and from there he is lacktose in tolerant which he cant stand the color white. The badguy uses this to his advantage which creates a corny showdown where Lundgren is blinding by white. John Woo's worst movie and putting Lundgren in it was a mistake also. The model is hot but this movie is not. I'm sensing a pattern in the movies Lundgren always picks..he's sorta doing the same thing, Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme are doing. Lundgren has only died in one movie that I remember and that was Universal Soldier..Seagal died in Executive Decision and Van Damme in a few. Well,, you get my point I hop 
 This one got way too much attention from NPR. I loved the interview there with the author, but, quite frankly, his entire story was told in that very sitting. This "book" is really an "essay" that doesn't deserve all the paper it's printed on; I would've been much more appreciative of this author's sentiments had it been marketed more appropriately 
 Based on various positive reviews, I was very eager to read this book.  I read it from cover to cover and I'm disappointed.  I completed the 40 day properity plan in February of this year. I took a leap of faith and followed the plan exactly by doing it over 40 consecutive days as the book requires.  It took two attempts before I was successful.  While I write this review seven months later, I have not received any financial blessings in my life.  The promises of abundance did not come to pass.  For the record, I am a Christian and believe in Jesus Christ as my savior.  I listen to religious programs on the radio and read the Bible from time to time.  Just because a book mentions God doesn't mean it's any good.  I should have known better 
 I've been reading this series since the 3rd or 4th book came out.  It's time to stop buying them and start checking them out from the library just to "check in" with these characters we love.  The mysteries themselves are no longer interesting or logical.  They're vague, goofy, strained.  The timeline in Jury's world is murky as well.  I think he is in his 70s now based on the WWII childhood Grimes has described for so long.  So how on earth old is CarolAnne?  And yes, it seems Grimes is trying to lower Jury's age by saying his memories of his mother are faulty memories.  All that aside, the central mystery each time should be compelling and that simply isn't the case anymore.  So I'm not buying any more of these books that are taking up so much space on my shelves.  I'll skim them at the library then decide whether or not to actually check them out in the future.  This is really disappointing.  
 I was disappointed in this memoir.  I'm a big fan of Richard Chamberlain's acting.  However, this book reads like one long psychotherapy session.  I came away from the experience feeling that Mr. Chamberlain is not a very complicated person.  The writing style and the book have too much of a surfacy, "sing-songy" quality for me 
 I found that tying in human traits to different styles of architecture was not interesting at all. There is no discussion of building techniques or the practical side of architecture.  This would be more for the artist that is trying to project different human feelings into the structure.  If you are looking for a techincal guide to architecture this is not it 
 I really like Fullmetal Alchemist, it's a great series, but these episodes unfortunately are not very good ones. To start off, the first episode on the disc, "Be Thou for the People" is so bad it's tortuous. The plot was totally cliche'd and comletely boring. I almost turned it off. The second episode "The Phantom Theif" is also boring, it was basically just an annoying filler episode. Then the next two episodes "The other Brothers Elric parts 1 and 2" are actually better than the other two but still don't keep up with the previous good episodes. This isn't a very good disc... I felt as though the creators could have put more into these episodes. One thing I noticed about Fullmetal Alchemist is that at times they will have a string of great episodes but then afterwards they will have one or two really bad episodes. For example the first three episodes were excellent but then episode four was a let down... Ed and Al reached thier goal way too easily, and the whole "Bad Guys on a train" incident is very cliche'd, they could have thought of something better. Also, another example, the episodes "The Alchemy Exam," "Night of the Chimera's Cry," and "The Philosipher's stone" were great episodes, but these episodes are a dissapointment. My bottom line is when FMA is good it's really good, when it's bad, it's really bad...but there is alot more good than bad and I would still highly recomend this series. Still, don't buy this disc, just watch these episodes on Adult Swim if you must watch them 
 I am very surprised with the rave reviews of this book here. I decided to purchase it for two reasons. First, I trusted the reviews here and decided it would be important to own this book. Second, I am familiar with Douglas Holt's academic work, and have read his articles in academic journals. I thought this book will be very interesting to read.  I am dissapointed mainly because I find that the book does not tell me something original. Instead what Douglas Holt keeps saying in this book is that building an iconic brand is possible by focusing on culture not products. His argument is not convincing, especially when he tries to disprove other forms of brand building: tradition, cultural and emotional. If I have a brand new product, can I still build an icon? Is it advantageous to have an iconic brand? What are the downside of it? These are not talked about in the book.   Another problem is that he keeps repeating the same argument again and again. It gets very boring after a few pages only.   What a disappointment! 
 If the author spent a few hours deciding on a clear purpose for this book she might have had something more readable. As it is, this reads as if she has diarrhea of the word processor and is in automatic (and unthinking) mode. She starts out the book with complaints about cliches but changes her mind when she admits that she uses them. Then she switiches to a tirade against buzz phrases, isn't really sure what they are, comes up with a new term - pop words -gives a definition that is as clear as mud, starts complaining again about cliches, and just blathers on and on. The book ends up being nothing but a sarcastic complaint against any words or phrases that get on HER nerves - and she seems easily irritated and hypersensitive. Well, if I was writing a book, my complaint would be about authors who have no clear focus and who think that the rest of us are interested in their pet peeves. If you are a great wit, you can get away with that. If not, you come off as a prematurely testy codger bellyaching about those uneducated mobs out there who don't know how to coin a new simile at the drop of a hat. Tedious, unfunny stuff. Don't waste your time 
 This book is absolute garbage.  I would never waste time to write a review unless I thought it was absolutely necessary.  All this book has to offer is a lesson in high school economics.   There is no content on trucking at all, maybey one page--one!!  These authors canned a bunch of economic/marketing mumbo jumbo and slapped a trucking label on it.   I am very dissapointed that Amazomn would even allow such a piece of s**t to be sold on their website.   Use this book to start a fire in your fireplace...that's all it's good for.  I'm not joking 
 So: alien civilizations with obviously vastly superior technology travel clear across the galaxy at speeds greater than the speed of light in order to--well, won't give the plot away, but trust me, they're not here to guests on Martha Stewart. And I find the plot, therefore, and all of these "aliens as terror sources" movies just--can I say this?--not fair to aliens!  OK, I don't have an aluminum foil hat on, I just think its childish. Stephen Greer, MD's "Hidden Truth" book suggests that this is the sort of fare we are to get from Hollywood--no more friendly E.T. types, just constantly the message of terror from the skies. This trend in cinema about foreign visitors is now so consistent that it just makes movies like this dull and predictable. And how we eventually beat back the aliens in this movie? Oh, you don't want to know.. 
 DON'T BUY THESE BAKING SHEETS.  I PLACED ONE IN A 425 OVEN AND IT WARPED, CAUSING A SPILL AND MESS IN THE OVEN 
 This is another product placement by Gary Null Inc. repackaged with a new title and cover. Gary Null is a God and knows everything about everything. Gary knows what you should eat and how you should think. Ignore the fact that he owns a private multi-million dollar media, supplement and gadget company that sells nearly all what he advises to consume. No conflict there at all? Gary is a brilliant marketer and here are his tactics:  1)Create documenteries, radio shows, movies, lectures, books that strike fear into your audience so that they are in a constant buying mode. Make them fear to breath the air, to  drink the water and make them fear their enviornment in total. Claim that you are the authority and others are cranks aimed at harming you and your audience. Evoke fear, conspiracy theories at every turn, and taint the competition (mainstream medicine) as immoral, money grubbing and intentionally harm promoting.   2)Provide a catalog of products to calm the fear evoked. Have them buy costly air filtration and water systems, expensive magnetic products, costly vitamins and supplements, and provide media so that you can reinforce the fear and buying behaviour. Advocate a costly and restrictive diet that few could follow for long so that they will fall back on your food replacement and food concentrates as well as vitamins. Above all promise you base that if they follow your advice and buy the products  they will look young and live forever. Promise the suckers that they will avoid sickness and will be the chosen ones.   3) Claim you make little or no money and that the profits go into making public service movies even though you charge to view them, and even though the profit markup on vits and supplements run in the hundreds percent range. Claim that you have advanced degrees and are a scienctific authourity even though you went to nontraditional schools and could not get a degree from a legit University. Should anyone challenge you claim that they are part of a conspiracy to silence you even though that if false- it increases the your profile among followers.   
 I agree with the negative comments - I eventually stopped watching it - unconvincing acting - (and a small point that I found irritating - in TV movies about war, some of them have a "too-clean look" that make a film seem unrealistic. There is no dirt anywhere, as far as I could see - everybody looks too clean, the settings look too clean, and not realistic. The acting level was what finally turned me off. Glad it was on TV 
 After browsing thru all the chapters, i got the impression that the author is only buzzword-compliant and cannot go into any detail in any subject area. She must have read a lot on ecommerce, but i doubt she ever did any "real work" with ecommerce. The writing reads like it comes from a "good" student who diligently repeats all the words a professor said in a business classroom 
 I have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title.  As others have pointed out, Coughlin's ego can be suffocating at times.  This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw.  Alas it is not.  The writing is amateurish at best and the author's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting.  The language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus.  Again this could be forgiven as we're reading this book for a soldier's account, not that of an English grad student.  This book offers a stark contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Fick's "One Bullet Away."  Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent, thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men, Coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else.  He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company.  You cannot know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin's character development is very superficial.  His attempts to convey a "human side" are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived.  This is a great contrast to the character development in "One Bullet."  There is no connection between author and reader in "Shooter."  Coughlin does not develop the role players either.  In "One Bullet" you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer, his NCOs and the enlisted men.  Additionally, Coughlin's demeaning descriptions of his support staff (non-trigger pullers) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic.  To make matters worse the action isn't as well developed as in other titles.  The author's self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits, with plenty of after-action chest thumping, obscures the view of battle.  He spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft, training and shooting.  This can be found elsewhere.  Overall this book was a great disappointment.  If only a fraction of Coughlin's self-acclaimed exploits are true, then he is a remarkable sniper.  He should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them 
 It was OK. When it comes to movie making Hollywood does it best.  
 "Kids- consider sharing this book with your parents - they'll understand you better." Oh really Reilly? If you read this book you'll know more about Bill and that is all. His "straight talk" is just his regurgitated opinion, based on his experiences and presented as doctrine. It's a mixed bag of conservative and liberal views and reads like a first draft of a high school creative writing assignment - written during lunch hour 
 I agree with the other bad reviews above.  One faviourable reviewer uses it for pool areobics which I assume dosnt involve submurging your head. The other faviourable reviewer who lane swims with it dosnt state his/her sex but I can only assume this reviewer is a woman who swims with her head above water (as many women do to protect their hair). I can only agree with the other reviewers who swim with it. The sound is already muffled and those things you stick in your ear (can be painful as you have to really shove them in)let the water in no matter how hard you try to plug them in your ear so after a few metres the sound is almost completely blocked rendering them useless. I also had the problem with the headphones though when I got a replacement pair with the lubricant there was no mention that I needed to use the lubricant to rectify that particular problem. Another review elsewhere mentioned you could try cutting back the plugs to suit your ears but I really cant see that this would help much. If someone out there does have this product and is using it sucessfully while submurged please write a review here and tell us what the rest of us are doing wrong but until then my advice to anyone wanting this for swimming with your head in the water is ...dont bother 
 Doesn't address this model.  Just higher-end ones.  Waste of money 
 Harris made a strong case for the beneficial role of the Hindu religion's belief that cows are sacred. The reason is because male draft animals are needed to plow the fields for next year's harvest, and cows are needed to breed the draft animals. Succumbing to temptation during a famine and killing your cow is like killing the goose that lays the golden egg.   Harris was not as convincing describing the "pig love" of the Maring tribe. They are a polygamous society in which women do all the work, both gardening and raising pigs. The pigs are beloved and wander freely. But after eight or ten years there are too many adult pigs. They cause too much destruction in the gardens, and they consume too much food. So the men agree to hold a grand feast, or kaiko, in which most of the pigs are slaughtered and eaten. Then the men go to war with the neighboring tribe.  This is a strange arrangement. If the Maring wanted to be efficient, they should pen the pigs. That way they won't damage the gardens. They should also slaughter the pigs as soon as they reach their adult size. Continuing to feed them for another eight years after they've already reached their adult size is a waste of food. That is not adaptive! Of course, Harris has an explanation. The reason why the Maring behave in their seemingly counter-productive way is that by being inefficient they can keep their population in check. Maximizing their pig production would take them dangerously close to the carrying capacity of their environment. The ritual warfare after the periodic feasts and the female infanticide also contribute to keep the size of the Maring population in harmony with the environment.  The role of "pig love" contradicts the role of "cow love." Beneficial cultural traits such as cow love are readily deemed functional and adaptive. But counter productive traits like pig love keep the population in check. Thus they are also functional and adaptive. Harris's functionalist view of anthropology is now revealed as a non-falsifiable hypothesis. If Indians did not practice cow love, Harris would doubtless say that consuming valuable breeding stock for food is an adaptive form of population control.  Another problem with the book is its description of potlatch, a practice of many primitive tribes such as the Kwakiutl. Potlatch is a practice in which the Big Men give massive amounts of food and other gifts away. This gift-giving occurs across tribal boundaries. Tribes that have had a good year give away more, and tribes that have had a bad year give away less. Thus there is a net flow of food from tribes that are successful to those that are less successful. Functionalist anthropologists like Harris see this as a simple but effective form of social insurance. Yet follow up studies of the Kwakiutl by anthropologists such as Ernest Ruyle show that the Big Men dominate their tribes. They take up to half of all the food production from the common people for themselves. They then give away only a portion of the confiscated goods - and gain social obligation from the recipient in the process. So while potlatch does play a minimal role as social insurance against bad times, it is predominately a means by which the Big Men maintain their dominance over the common people.  Finally, Harris' book presents yet another revisionist version of Christian history in which Jesus is a failed military messiah who was recast as the Prince of Peace. Revisionist Christian histories are a long tradition. In 1890 another anthropologist, Sir James Frazer, published the influential book 'The Golden Bough.' It claims, contrary to Harris, that Jesus was supposed to be killed and resurrected but that this idea was actually borrowed from paganism. It played a role in C.S. Lewis' agnosticism, and it was only as it began to be debunked in the early 20th century that C.S. Lewis became a Christian. For a more modern debunking, see 'The Gospel and the Greeks' by Ronald Nash. Other revisionisms claim that Jesus never existed - he was a legend. No serious historian today would endorse that position. And you can't go more than a few months without hearing about one of the gnostic gospels such as the Gospel of Judas or the Gospel of Mary.   Until reading Harris' book I had not heard of the theory that Jesus was a failed military messiah. And while Harris occassionally mentions historians by name, he does not provide a single reference. My recommendation to the more serious skeptic is to look for more reputable skeptical work. The most popular skeptical work on the historicity of Jesus is coming from a group of more than 200 historical scholars called the Jesus Seminar. They are a skeptically minded group (i.e. evangelicals do not like them) that has challenged the validity of the gospels. 'The Five Gospels' by Robert Funk is an accessible summary of their findings, and their work contradicts Harris' revisionism. For example, the group has a strong consensus that Jesus really did say to turn the other cheek, and to love your enemies. Hardly the words of Harris' military messiah. For a criticism of the Jesus Seminar, I would recommend 'The Challenge of Jesus' by N.T. Write.   I recommend that open-minded readers instead buy 'Sick Societies' by Robert Edgerton. It is an accessible but dense, tour of the literature that debunks the two sacred cows of anthropology: cultural relativism and adaptivism/functionalism 
 I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.  
 Triple H(as Fed Up): I love Britney, she is so pretty and nice and so on. Shawn Michaels(as Hellraiser): Anyone who hates her are just jealous! Triple H: Well, we got some news, Britney is nothing but an ugly redneck piece of trailer trash. Shawn Michaels: This no-talent hack is a washed up skank whose career sank. Triple H: This chick is a skank, unlike my wife Stephanie McMahon who looked good whilst carrying my first child(I just had a daughter). Shawn Michaels: Britard on the other hand is one ugly airbrushed, lying hypocrite. D-Generation X says if you are not down with DX and you choose to be down with Britney and her blind sheep fans, WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells S*CK IT) 
 To attach this to your fridge, you have to attach the magnets to the back of the board. Unfortunately, the magnets stick very poorly, and after 10 or 20 minutes, the board falls down, leaving the magnets behind. I tried pressing them down overnight, but that didn't help. Now have to go find some epoxy to stick them on.  Update: after gluing them to the back, it has worked well. The eraser on the pen is a bit flimsy and I don't expect it to last, but there's always paper towels 
 I bought this book because I had read a good review of the follow-up "Murder of Angels" and thought this would be a better starting point.  I am a voracious reader, and I can honestly say I rarely use the word "hate" when describing a book.  I won't use it this time either, but I will say that I can never get back the time I spent (wasted?) reading this book.  To be fair, maybe it just wasn't for me.  If you are really into super-confusing, creepy books with self-pitying, annoying, wear-it-on-their sleeve outcast characters-- this might be just the tale for you 
 The first 50 pages of the book are thrilling, is a murder conspiracy and they made everything to complete their assignment, but when Mary decides to be the ambassador of Romania, the book get boring and boring unless you want to know how an ambassador must behave with everybody everywhere, when the book starts explaining this, you will get lost of the main story that has to many voids, of course as in these kind of books the end is a fairy tale and the epilog is made to keep the story open, sincerely I don't recommend this book, there are many spies books much better than this one. 
 Mortal Kombat: Annihilation is one of those films that is so bad that it actually HURTS to watch it. From the nearly complete recast of almost all of the characters (odd, considering that in interviews after the first movie, all of them said they'd want/ be willing to come back for a sequel), to the horrible (even by 1997 standards) CG effects, to the cliched fight scenes (gee...two women in a mud pit.  I bet it took them all night to come up with that one), virtually everything that could have gone wrong with this movie DID go wrong with this movie. Loosely based on the story of the Mortal Kombat 3 video game (and set immediately after the first movie, which, while not great, looks like Citizen Kane compared to this stinkburger), the movie set about the lofty goal of depicting Shao Khan (played by Brian Thompson, the alien bounty hunter from The X-Files) and his army (shown in most scenes as a small band of extras.  Oooh...scary.) as they attempt to take over Earth by merging it with the alternate dimension known as Outworld.  This merging of realms will result in the destruction of humanity. With only a week to do anything about it, Lord Raiden (played by James Remar, replacing the, and I can't believe I'm saying this, much better Christopher Lambert in the role) once again enlists the help of Liu Kang (Robin Shou), Sonia Blade (Sandra Hess), and Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto), along with help from a select few other characters from the video games' crowded lineup, to prevent this from happening. The story in and of itself is not necessarily bad.  However, given the film's obviously low budget the weak screenplay, the loss of most of the excellent cast from the first film, and most jarringly, direction even more inept than that of Paul W.S. Anderson, it quickly becomes clear that they set their sights too high, only to have practically everything come crashing down. The only saving grace of this film is its killer soundtrack, featuring an updated version of the theme created for the first movie, as well as music by KMFDM, Megadeth, Rammstein, Juno Reactor, and others. If ever you're looking to punish yourself for something, then by all means watch this movie.  However, if you actually like yourself and want to remain on good terms with yourself, you will avoid this movie like the plague.  Believe me, you'll thank yourself later. 
 I don't know if the "special edition" is an improovment over the theatrical release,but the original was a big downer.I was honestly expecting alot more from this movie based on the teasers&trailers.It started with an excellent opener,and after that...it was all down hill.A dull action flick without much eye poping action,much of it had been done 100 times over in numerous other films&done better.I did'nt care either way what happened to any of the characters,I was just waiting on who got wasted next.It's not terrible to watch once,but that is all it's good for.Certainly not worth purchasing to own 
 The book is very simple and tertiary.  Lightly discusses a number of topics.  Details related to form and execution are lacking for someone who claims to have their Doctorate.  The illustration is worse than what I can create on my home computer.  The real issue I have is that the author and the publisher are both deceptive in their practices.  Although the book appears to be a significant volume...in fact, it is triple spaced text with 20-26 font all to increase the number of pages to appear as if the book is a significant volume.  In addition, the basics for any book such as an Index are missing entirely.  This book is a joke even if it was priced at $3-$4 it would not be worth the shipping & handling 
 I felt this book had too many recipes for chickpeas and blackbeans.  I would not recommend this book 
 One of the other reviewers gave this two stars and said he was being generous. He was very generous. If I could, I'd give it a negative 5 stars. Unfortunately, Amazon won't let me give it less than 1 star. The saddest part is that the plot itself is pretty good, but the writing is so bad, it completely negates anything else. If the constant comments concerning clothing (or lack thereof), sex, thoughts, of sex, and attempts to get sex or use sex as a weapon had been eliminated, the book would have been about 60 pages. Maybe not even that 
   Robert B. Parker is stuck in a rut. That he has a profound and almost pathological hatred of suburbia, the traditional family and conservative Christians should be patently obvious by now to any of his readers this side of raving idiocy. Sadly, these obsessions get progressively worse with each book he writes. I say sadly because cleary Parker has no small talent as a writer. If he could overcome his irrational prejudices against normal people, and attempt to construct them as real characters instead of laughably absurd cardboard cut-outs, he might become a truly great author.    One scene where this paranoia passed the absurd and entered the realm of the bizarre was when the character Rita Fiore, a single and openly  promiscuous career woman, lamented about the upbringing of her niece in the (gasp!) suburbs, and how she wishes she could "save" her from her Mom and Dad. How nauseating! Spoken like a true social engineer. I guess only the elite who live in chic downtown apartments and drink imported beer should be allowed to raise children.   But seriously, the way Parker not only belittes, but casually writes off, 75% of his fellow citizens (that is, normal people who live in 2 parent homes, go to church, and recognize a moral code outside of themselves) is sometimes quite chilling. He portrays them as being something almost subhuman. It makes you wonder what would Parker and his intellectual ilk do if they were ever put in charge.   Despite these serious shortcomings, Parker's writing is as disciplined as ever. As usual, he does a good of showing rather than telling, and his characters evoke strong emotions in the reader. I always hold out hope that Parker will one day overcome his tragically stunted view of the world, and make full use of the gifts the Good Lord has given him 
 Erskine Caldwell while apparently wrote during a different time, apparently did nothing to promote anything other than stereotypes of the rural south.  I myself am from a small rural town in Arkansas and grew up with stories my grandparents told of their experiences during the great depression.  They were poor and lived by subsistence farming but they were proud and spoke with a sense of accomplishment of their home life.  While their education and opportunities may have been limited it seemed to make them appreciate what they did have later.  I was surprised to find out that Caldwell had actually lived in the South following my reading the book because he didn't seem to have anything pleasant to say about it at all.  All regions of the country do have impoverished persons who have no ambition to improve themselves nor realize the situation that they're in but this I felt was an unfair take on what was not an easy time for anyone in America.    If you like southern literature, I would much more highly recommend a Willie Morris book, Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Ann Burns, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, maybe one of Shelby Foote's works of fiction, or Eudora Welty amongst others.  In those stories, poverty and racism which are issues in the south are evident but portrayed in a more fair and consistent light.  I will admit in closing that I was interested in the story and finished the book fairly quickly but I felt the content was not all that impressive and only served to deepen stereotypes and preordained views that wrongly exist about the South 
 Professor Lee's disdain for rigorous analysis, explicitly stated in numerous places in this book, sets a poor example for his students and the engineering community.   On p. 72 we see the most explicit statement of this attitude: "The fussy reader will note that, strictly speaking, the integral is improper. We don't worry about such minor details; we're engineers. Thus, the integral of sine is cosine and that's that."   In this particular case, the result obtained is correct, so Dr. Lee's neglect of rigor hasn't resulted in an error. It demonstrates an attitude, however, that is inimical to the competent practice of engineering, in which rigorous mathematical analysis plays a very significant role. When rigor is discarded, the results will be correct some of the time, but they will also be incorrect some of the time.  An example where the lack of rigor I described leads to an incorrect result can be found in another of Dr. Lee's publications [1]. Here the authors observe that for a certain feedback system with two loops, one of the error signals has the form e=X/(1+H(s)), which looks a lot like the error signal for a single loop, e=X/(1+T(s)). The authors conclude that H(s) must be an "effective loop transmission" describing the stability of the two loop system, which a more rigorous analysis shows to be incorrect.  While intuition and rules of thumb are certainly useful in engineering, Dr. Lee makes a fetish of these shortcuts. His style lacks the rigor that one would expect from a engineering textbook, and then adds insult to injury by making the bizarre claim that the rigor is unnecessary.   [1] "Automatic phase alignment for a fully integrated Cartesian feedback power amplifier system", Dawson, J.L., Lee, T.H., Solid-State Circuits, IEEE Journal of, Volume 38,  Issue 12,  Dec 2003 Page(s):2269 - 2279. 
 Includes miles of intellectual blather. Fits well into sexually charged point of view  of photography. Uses most horrific and grotesk as examples. On page 33 in third edition author mentions head decapitation as one photographer's "external" influences. Uses sexual pictures as examples. Generally a politically correct lightly negative type discourse on photography. I feel sorry for the students subjected to this pulp 
 My boys and I read "My Side of the Mountain" together for our homeschooling lessons. I can't tell you how much we loved the book! Jean Craighhead-George does a remarkable job of taking the reader deep into the wilderness of the Catskills, complete with reference to Washington Irving's Rip VanWinkle. We were delighted by each and every page.  Why in the world any screen write would change such a marvelous creation is beyond me! The movie wasn't even close to the novel, and we felt like it was a complete waste of time to watch. I can only wonder what the book's author must have felt watching a washed and clearly faded rendition of her creation. She must have been deeply disappointed.  The book itself would make a wonderful screenplay all its own. We truly hope that someone will resurrect the story and put it on the screen in all its glory. Until then, this movie is not it! Save your money; buy the book! 
 Watching "Toys" was like watching "Teletubbies" dumbed down for an audience of subhumans.  Six Million Jews died in concentration camps during World War II.  It took the combined forces of the free world to stop this genocide.  Williams and the production company that made "Toys" are just closet nazis.  Inasmuch as I watched this self-righteous piece of elitist garbage, I can say without any hestiation that if you believe that whole nations would be better off in the hands of two-bit despots, then maybe you'll be stupid enough to accept the premise of this unadulterated nonsense.    Pray for peace, but never give in to evil 
 When I first opened the booklet (it's really not a book) I didn't know how to crochet at all. Having read the whole book, I still don't know how to crochet. There needs to be diagrams on the project cards. There's no way to learn from these project even though it says beginners can use this kit. The photography is lovely and the projects are cute but I'm going to have to learn ro crochet somewhere else and then revisit this kit 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 This is a real electronic sounding band that has no guitar solos or good vocals. Infact they are not real good at all. All they have going for them is the lyrics, and they are getting old. They are so simular to the Hybrid theory. All of the songs sound genaric and not real fancy or hard to do. Its all in the synth. I cant say I love it, or even that its just OK. I owned it for years but I finally sold it, thank god 
 I read a lot of good things about Eric Meyers and people say he's practically like the king of CSS teachers or something. I read reviews from amazon about this book and decided it was time I read this book. At first, it seemed like a good book, explaining core concepts of CSS to me. I've been using it for years, but never really had a book teach me everything, I picked it up as I went along. However, as I reached further into the book, the topics became more complicated and his explanations became weaker and weaker. There are no practical examples. I was hoping to get some insight in the way certain code could be used but instead, this was more like a help/reference manual which made me wonder why I even needed this book in that case when there are great help/reference manuals all over the Internet.  I thought reading this book would make me like Mr. Meyer's apprentice, to learn from the master. It was like going to an experienced carpenter and being told "This is a hammer, u hit nails with it." and then leaving. I was looking for more like "this is a hammer, notice how if I hit it hard it causes a dent in the wood, but a soft touch allows you to keep an even wood surface, use least amount of energy and still get the job done."  I learnt more about CSS from other books that were nothing more than basic introductions 
 I don't understand the high ratings on this book. It sucked. It was so boring. I like most of the Buffy books but this one was just a snoozer 
 I wasn't the actual store it was the play. I put it in the garage somewhere. I wanted the actual book! Why didn't it say it was the play? I didn't even read it!!!!   pattydoone@sbcglobal.ne 
 This book is full of typos; what happened to proofreading...is that a lost art/job?  This book is also a good example of what Andy Rooney spoke of; authors making thousands on the backs of others.  Nothing is original by the author in this book; it is merely a compliation of the works of others.  You would think at least, since the author did have to compose anything, she could have at least proofread it 
 Our daughter loves the puppet in the Baby Shakespeare video -- Bard, the Poetic Dragon.  It was quite disappointing for us to discover that the character in this book is not Bard, the "star" of the Shakespeare video, but some unknown lizard character.  Needless to say, the book doesn't grab our daughter's attention because she doesn't recognize that character.  No wonder there's no photo of the book cover in it's listing here, on Amazon 
 This is an autobiography of the author's spiritual journey to enlightenment - in the end it is not clear to me whether he ever became fully enlightened. He has certainly recounted numerous experiences that naturally lead to enlightenment. I found this book interesting in parts, but not consistently so. I did not like the writing style which seemed disjointed, and so the story did not flow for me. The book is OK, but now that I have read it, I feel my time would have been more productively employed reading something else 
 this book really was a piece of trash, the story line sucked. eric you can do bette 
 The book is not bad if you can get over the liberal agenda. What would be expected from Mike Wallace? I hate to admit this, I would like to have seen historical pictures of the CMH and its recipients. 
 This is the second Edelman book I've read, which was supposedly for a popular, albeit educated, audience, and like "Wider Than The Sky", I found his prose uniquely bad and off-putting. I've read loads of books now on the mind, from Searle, the Churchlands, Fodor, Pinker, Ramachandran, Gazzaniga, et al, and all of them are able to express themselves clearly even when discussing sophisticated concepts. But for me, reading anything by Gerald Edelman is a terrible chore - like some crazy reading comprehension test devised by a sadist - rather than an exciting journey through a brilliant mind. Indeed, I wondered a few times reading this book if Edelman might even feel a perverse pride in keeping his writing below the average standards of intelligibility.  Australian philospher David Stove once remarked that he very much appreciated the contributions of John Stuart Mill, because while (he thought) Mill was wrong, his ideas were expressed with great clarity, allowing them to be more easily evaluated (which in turn facilitated greater understanding). Edelman must be a smart man, so I wish he was able to more effectively communicate his ideas. When so many of his colleagues can do it, I don't know why he can't.  Addendum Mar. 10, 2007: I just read John Horgan's book "The End of Science", and was surprised to find a section on none other than Edelman himself. I was even more surprised (and frankly, sort of thrilled) by the quotes there from Edelman's peers (like Daniel Dennett and the late Francis Crick), on the incomprehensibility of Edelman's gobbledygook (in the back of my mind I was still wondering whether it was just me...). In fact, one fellow scientist expresses his judgment that Edelman tries to disguise unoriginal ideas through the use of rhetorical bluster, pedantry, and new names. 
 Apparently windbags on the left are as eager to exploit the September 11 tragedy as are their noxiously gaseous counterparts on the right, which, as a progressive, I find distressing. Actually, this book is offensive on several fronts. First off, it is sloppily thrown together, with slipshod, clearly tossed-off contributions from many left-of-center journalists, some of whom (like Michael Moore) tend to speak before they think, thus hurting their cause, however worthy it might be. On top of that, the book becomes redundant, with contributors echoing each other over and over and over again. Better and much less indulgent editing would have helped here. The book's design, too, leaves a lot to be desired (it's downright ugly). The worst offense, though, has been committed by the book's publisher, which crassly released this volume just in time for 9/11's first anniversary, thus proving itself as rapacious as any fly-by-night right-wing press. But then, as I'm sure the authors of this tome would agree, that's capitalism 
 I ordered the "fedora".  I am so dissapointed, it came off within a few hours!  Just peeled right off. Do not order this brand of fingernail polish. It is the worst I have ever used 
 Reading Mr. O'Rourke's "All the Troubles in the World" gave me the impression that he is an excellent political/economics analyst with a tolerable bad streak. The fine writing in that book encouraged me to acquire some of his other work.   I was horribly repulsed by the explicit language, immature humor and overall repugnance of his guide to manners. What I had hoped would be a light poke at contemporary society so sickened me that I threw the book in the trash before I was halfway done. I regret reading even that far 
 This book is a little pricy and is not really intended for the small job shop.  
 I'm sick and tired of those self proclamed experts. If you want to learn anything get Disease Prevention and Treatment from life extension and for healing Qi-Gong practice is a much better bet than hand holding a good start for pretecting your dna is stop eating food filled with pesticide take 200 mcg of selenium, 800 mcg of folic acid and 50 mcg of B12 and threw some resveratrol (turn on the longevity gene)while you at it. Broccoli is a good one too as long as it is not over cooked. I wasted some money here!!!   PS:for example folic acid deficiency leads to DNA damage...and hard earned money invested in nonsens books 2. Not saying that the psyche does not play a role i'm just saying that this particular book is ridiculous. Live long and prosper ; 
 The text is not a good tool for 1Ls to learn crim law by itself.  Most of my classmates and I found the text to be poorly organized and written - especially for those just trying to grasp the intricacies of crim law.  Probably a better book for studying statutory interpretation or philosophy of crim law.  Prepare to become intimate with the MPC if you are assigned this text.  I highly recomend a companion book for the text, one keyed to it such as Blackletter outline by Dressler or the Understanding Crim Law companion by Dressler.  I used both and they saved me from utter confusion 
 My wife an I bought the book and tried the diet.  We could not last the 2 weeks on phase 1.  Neither of us can stand the taste of fish, so our limited choices were limited even more.  The first week went okay, but by the second week, we noticed that we had become quite irritable.  We did not want to see another salad, cheese stick, chicken, or lean ground beef.  It was not so much that we craved breads, pastas, and candy.  We missed fruit.  Even though it would only be a few more days to reach phase 2, we decided to ignore this book and start with a diet based on the government guidelines (the "dreaded" low-fat, high-fiber, portion control diet).  In addition, we made exercise a part of our daily routine.  Our moods improved quickly,  Weight is coming off.  We are getting stronger and more fit.  It's been about a month since we quit South Beach and we are happy with our current diet and have no desire to dump it.  One thing South Beach did teach us was the importance of snacking.  It really helps with portion control and hunger issues.  Only, we changed it from cheese and nuts to no-fat yogurt, fruit, or veggies 
 If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much 
 I know this seems a little OCD but I was looking up some things at the patent office and also at the US copyright office and this book does not have a copyright. odd 
 I haven't finished listening to this yet and I'll probably shelve it. The original soundtrack is THE BOMB, one of the best film scores ever, but this doesn't live up to its name of "More music from Braveheart". It seems like an ill attempt at squeezing more money out of a good thing. There are only a few unreleased tunes on this album (I counted 5 out of the 25 listed). If you want to hear the speeches over again, I suggest watching the movie instead. This was a disappointment from an otherwise exc. original movie score. Save your money and continue to listen to the first one 
  These boots where definitely a disappointment from Kenneth Cole. They did not resemble leather in the least.  They looked terrible on me; maybe there is someone out there that they would look good on. 
 Michael Ruse fails to sustain his argument, I'm afraid, in THE EVOLUTION-CREATION STRUGGLE.  The title is misleading because it's not specific enough.  The story of the anti-Enlightenment/anti-Darwin fundamentalist backlash is not new, and Ruse doesn't attempt to add anything to it.  What IS new is the story Ruse tells of how "evolutionism" was also a reaction to the Enlightenment, a more optimistic reaction.  The best part of the book is Ruse's marshalling of evidence to this effect in the period prior to the Darwinian revolution.  And before I forget to say it, Ruse is not arguing that modern biology and the neo-Darwinian synthesis it's based on is not scientific.  What he is discussing is the wider metaphysical backdrop of the scientific theory of natural selection-plus-genetics.    But it's a classic case of a Procrustean bed -- Ruse tries to fit his intellectual history into the constraining concept that creationists are premillennialists and "evolutionists" are postmillennialists.  In other words, the liberal/progressive intellectuals and scientists can also be situated on the Christian metaphysical terrain -- they believe that it is up to humanity to perfect the world BEFORE Christ returns.  I just don't buy it.  The claim is too big and his evidence too scanty, indirect, and circumstantial.    There does seem to be some truth to a more general idea, which is far from original.  Max Weber, the great German sociologist, claimed that the Protestant work ethic continued to propel the accumulation of wealth even after the religious belief fell away (THE PROTESTANT ETHIC AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM).  And the process philosopher Alfred North Whitehead famously said that "[The Middle Ages] was the age of faith based upon reason.  [The 18th Century in Europe] was the age of reason, based upon faith."  (SCIENCE AND THE MODERN WORLD, p. 57).  In other words, the structure of belief continues to inform thought even after belief fades.  But here is where Ruse goes wrong, in my view.  He elides the distinction, and claims that the BELIEF continues, and so calls "evolutionism" a form of religious belief, a postmillennial religious belief.    Some further thoughts on the flaws in Ruse's argument:  1) Darwin's theory of natural selection has always struck me as depressing.  Compelling, but depressing.  I am certainly not alone in this.  So there is a big problem with Ruse's insistence that "evolutionism" is necessarily an optimistic view.  This is one way that the observable facts do not fit his conceptual scheme.  2) An increasingly influential faction among the evangelical/fundamentalists is known as the Dominionists -- James Dobson of Focus on the Family is the leading figure in this group.  The Dominionists are -- postmillennialists!  They are aspiring theocrats, who believe it the job of the Christians to take over the government and rule according to Old Testament principles in preparation for Christ's return.  This is another case where the observable facts do not support Ruse's theory of "fundamentalist premillennialists" versus "progressive postmillennialists."  3) Ruse has left many support structures out, and expects the premillennial/postmillennial concept alone to support the weight of his vast construct.  There is no discussion of liberal and conservative ideology, for instance, and how they have changed over time in the U.S. and the U.K., a glaring oversight.  Also missing is any examination of the idea of sociocultural evolution, a central concept in anthropology (it should be a central concept in sociology as well), which is not at all the same as biological evolution.  Ruse could make a much more cogent argument if he disentangled the two, but it would be a more complex argument.    I agree with Ruse's practical conclusions, that defenders of science should avoid bashing religion, as Richard Dawkins is prone to do, and that defenders of science should rise above their differences to work together more effectively in keeping ID and other religious notions out of biology classes.  And fortunately the unconvincing historic argument of THE EVOLUTION-CREATION STRUGGLE is not necessary to either of those worthy aims.            
 I guess this wasnt the type of book for me... it was boring, not surprising, and it felt like 3 months had gone by since i started the book (took me 2 weeks to read)! If i hadn't had to read this for school I would've never finished it 
 This archly coy wanna-be was replete with a number of errors that any halfway decent historical novelist should have caught. The Season starts in March, so people are returning to London then, NOT leaving it. And a woman being the victim of a would-be fiance's amnesia is NOT grounds for denying her vouchers to Almack's. People married younger in those days, but for the Darcy twins to say they had 17 year old friends who were already married a year? Mr. Gardiner was Mrs. Bennet's BROTHER, NOT her UNCLE! Nor was he "in trade", per se; he was a solicitor. Has this woman even READ Pride & Prejudice, or just the Cliff Notes (tm)? And those are just for starters. Badly contrived and far too derivative of what the author thinks the original was 
 Only 1 or 2 songs worth multiple listens.....And who is the Rabbi-dude in the middle of that one song?  Sounds like a parody.  
 Ok first off the art work is actually pretty damn good if you like comic art from 40z comics by Jim Mahfood, Invader Zim, Johnny homiciadal maniac ect..... But, seriously don't buy this flaming turd.... I checked this out from something called the Library which lets you look at books for free!  Story plot is very very bad.....Take matrix take bill and teds adventure and spice in some akira rip offs and you have this bland book.  The consensus has been slowly taking away our dreams towards making us all mindless slaves in our "awaken" reality.  But, our hero Zeke gets to club zero thanks to some akira clones that brought certain people to the club. He's the key for the akira clones to break on through to the other side ie the present awoken world.  And also they need him to help stop the consensus from making everyone mindless in either realm.  Oi enough of this crap it goes on and on.  Zeke gets those at the club to remember it in awaken world dad isnt dad or is he. Consense can offer him everything if he stops and oh boy big confirtation at the end where it's all up to Zeke to deterimine what's going to happen to reality as we know... What does he do?!?!? Oh guess what one makes their own choices and decisions in life cause Zeke choose's YOU!! Yes YOU!! Thats right!!! What the F crap ending is this?!? Why it's something out of choose your own adventure book or some crappy ass lesson  brought to you by barny the loveable dinasour! The only way you could give this a 5 star rating is if your brain is rotted out on E bomb cause like matirx 2 half of this book waste pages just showing the kids at rave after rave! 
 I know the book is aimed at "young adults" but I cannot help pointing out that over 100 pages of psycho-babble with a "see the end from 20 miles away" style is just horrible to read! If you have actually read 1984 then leave this "book" alone 
 While few can argue Mark's rise to fame and fortune is anything but spectacular, but to believe that virtually every decision he's made in his life has turned out fantastically well is a bit hard to swallow. At every turn (which happens to be accompanied by the phrase..."I jumped in...") is another remarkable success.   If he showed a bit more vulnerability in his stories, it would have been more believable, insightful and inspirational.   I also could have done without excruciating detail of every season of survivor...it got a bit old 
 I bought it and took it right back.  If it only had more Heat.  I was disapointed in the High Heat setting. It did not get too warm. I suppose it is good for Old women..   I needed something with more Heat.  
 I got this audiobook because I was so impressed with Kay Arthur's insight, compassion and wisdom in her segments of the DivorceCare New Edition volume on sexual purity outside of marriage. Sadly those qualities are notably missing here.   Her presentation style here is dry and boring. Her exegesis and exposition pedestrian, uninspired and uninspiring. Kay Arthur drones on and on and on using a preaching style that (thankfully) died around 1964. Especially annoying to this listener is her overuse of the term "my beloved" to refer to the listener. What worked so well for J. Vernon McGee and others simply falls flat here. Imagine your mother lecturing you with a shaking finger in your face and then backing off, smiling and saying, "My beloved!" and you've got the picture - it feels incongruous and insincere.    Blatantly missing here is that Ms. Arthurs says NOTHING about her poor sexual decisions after her divorce and where they took her. Thus an wonderful opportunity to connect with the listener with experience based empathy and, "Trust me I've been there!" wisdom is lost. Instead the listener is left with yet another one of these dry, boring, legalistic sounding, "No! No! No!" lectures on sex that we old Christians have now endured to the point of numbing brain death.   This material has been said better, more completely and more systematically elsewhere. This book adds NOTHING to the lexicon of Christian literature on sex and simply did NOT need to be written at all. This reviewer would recommend that the reader look to the work of James Dobson, Neil Clark Warren, Les and Leslie Parrot, Jay Adams, Steve Arterburn, Henry Cloud and John Townsend for sound exegesis and practical guidance in understanding and adhering to the Biblical view of sex and sexual practice.   Buy this book ONLY if you want a good "church lady" Bible thumping.   I normally find much to like in Kay Arthur's work but this one was a disappointment 
 This LITTLE Booklet does not provide comprehensive information about vitamins and minerals. Short questions and answers do not give enough information to be of any help.  You will be very disappointed with this booklet if you are searching for in depth guidance.  The title is very misleading. 
 I'm sorry to say I didn't like the movie at all.  The characters were phony, superficial, clichéd, with those convenient traits that only show in time for the required plot twist. But the worst for me, was that the comedy felt forced, contrived, and not funny at all. The image is anamorphic but soft and with really terrible ghosting, a clear case of PAL to NTSC conversion, though I may be wrong 
 I have rated this a 1 star because I have yet to receive the product that I ordered in November.                                                         B.R. from St Louis                                                                              
 This book was horrible! There was no logical order to the book because it is just a bunch of stories put together about Duveen. It is so boring, all the book does is talk about how dumb millionares were and how they were stupid enough to buy from Duveen and his crazy ways. This book was so bad, please save yourself the time and money and not buy this book 
 Science, properly understood, means proving a hyphothesis and having that proof replicated by one's peers.  This was not done with McCrone's "proof" obtained only by McCrone using his "instruments".  No verification by reputable laboratories equals taking McCrone's "proof" as a matter of faith ..........in McCrone.  A fool's choice 
 The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be "artistic" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.  Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.   At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his "package."  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.  This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film "seems" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.     One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.   Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.  In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me 
 I just had my two and a half year old son evaluated as having SI.  The therapist recommended this book.  I found other reviews interesting and was immediately put off by the cover I am looking for whatever positive help I can get.  I wish more was known about this condition.  Or that I knew of a support group as I don't have any family who live anywhere close around me.  My son has an amazing memory and is very lively and outgoing.  He also has extreme tantrums and throws things and seemed to get really fustrated so some of the SI checklist definetly applyed and made sense.  He also is very keyed into me and I can't even get in the shower or go to the bathroom without him getting upset.  Some of what they state didn't seem to fit him though like he crawled and walked early and seemed to have good co-ordination eating with a spoon or fork?     My husband and I definetly need to understand how to try and change or help things in the home situation.   I think it was a bad marketing move to create the cover they did as it creates such a negative reaction 
 Hope Edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. She has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. The second hole in Edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? I'll believe it when I see it. It's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. Within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that Edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant. Other than these two crucial holes, Edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. It's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own 
 The only reason you should buy and read this book is if it isrequired reading for a class. You are buying an advertisement for Fast Company Magazine. The writing is sketchy at best, and the examples are vague. You  get access to their Web site for online tests, but the site is poorly done  with typographical errors. There are other better texts on organizational  behavior 
 It is another sign of deterioration in the field of Speech-Language Pathology when the person elected to head the national organization in a time of crisis specializes in a medical procedure, rather than speech and language therapy. The field is in danger of losing even more of its focus and credibility than it already has. Unless SLP's concentrate on the core essentials of slp practice and find and refine treatment methods that have clinical research to back up their efficacy, the future is dim. Branching out into medical methods, as Logemann has done, is irrelevant to the serious needs of slp practice today. That Logemann was elected to head our national organization is a bad sign - not because of any merit or lack of it on her part but because the field seems to have no sense of what direction it should have. In the end, it seems to be a battle among three divisions in our field: those who are simply quacks and who are totally unconcerned with efficacy and who want the field to remain on an intuitive and "artistic/creative" level, those who want to rush into medical procedures that have nothing to do with speech and language problems, and those who want to concentrate on the core essentials of the speech and language disorders which our clients bring to us but who want to junk the quack treatments that discredit the field. What happens in the next few years, and the leadership we are given will determine if the field has a future 
 At first loved it because the travel system, with stroller, is so light and doesn't look doudy like other systems.  But: the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car. The straps never tangled, but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed. The carrying handle has to moved up/down with two hands, a button on each, that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle. Difficult to perform when you're already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby. Yes it is a trendy color with the gray, but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe! It is horribly hot for the baby. Still love the stroller by combi, but I never recommend the car seat to ANYONE. Luckily, time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway. 
 After downloading the CheckWriter DB from Wiley's companion site for the book Access 2003 Programming Weekend Crash Course, I try and try but it will not run; it cannot find the linked files; and the "tools" for reference and linking are greyed out. So we "Crash" on page 10. How can the author claim he is teaching us Professional Techniques when his program will not run out of the box 
 Although this book has wonderful facts and figures, and should be used as a reference material, it is awfull for reading. The only way you will finish reading this book is if you have to for school or you are very motivated. It is slow and does not keep your attention 
 I find it amusing that every gangster biographer wants to elevate his subject to the level of being the most important figure ever in the history or organized crime. But one would expect a certain level of objectivity from a former FBI agent, even one who self-promoted himself for years as Chicago's number one Mob-buster. Roemer's admiration for adversary Tony "Joe Batters" Accardo is understandable in a way. Clearly one of the most untouchable mobsters of all time (though it is not true that he never spent a night in jail), Accardo's seventy year criminal career with no standing convictions shows he was no dumb hood. All the same, Roemer goes out of his way to inject Accardo into everything that ever happened in Chicago. His account of the Prohibition years is so far off the mark it's hilarious. He has Tony Accardo saving Capone from Hymie Weiss in the Hawthorne attack, which contemporary accounts credit to Frank Rio. He places Tony in New York with Jack McGurn, Anselmi and Scalise, and "a guy named Rio Burke" as the hitters of Frankie Yale in that city's first Tommygun killing. Strange, as I met the late Rio Burke and SHE never once mentioned handling a machine gun though she was a friend of Al Capone. Tony, McGurn, Anselmi and Scalise and "possibly Fred Burke" (in whose Michigan hideout the machine guns were found) are claimed to have been the St. Valentine's Day Massacre gunmen, on the basis of some bugged conversations Roemer claims to have heard years later and vaguely alludes to. More credible suspects, such as Gus Winkeler, who later ran Moran's former North Side territory for Capone and was highly publicized in the early Thirties, and Raymond "Crane-Neck" Nugent, who was once arrested at Capone's Miami estate, are dismissed as insignificant nobodies on the bare fringe of the Capone mob. Roemer goes on to have Accardo accompany Capone to the famous Atlantic City Mob convention, again at the expense of number one bodyguard Frank Rio, and conveniently oversteps the Philadelphia arrest and conviction of Capone and RIO by moving the meeting ahead one year to 1930. I find it amazing that a guy like Roemer could spend all that time investigating the Chicago Mob and display such little knowledge of its early years. No wonder the FBI took so long in catching up with organized crime! Roemer should have either stuck with the Fifties/Sixties time-frame he knew firsthand or else done some competent research on the pre-World War II era. As for the claim that Accardo had "more brains before breakfast than Al Capone had all day," well, like I said earlier, Tony's successful life in crime is impressive, and owes much to his low-key style but one doesn't need to distort history to emphasize this. And, when it all comes down to it, Capone was the guy who built the Chicago Mob and the guy who brought Accardo up through the ranks as well. Successful as he was, Tony was only following in Al's footsteps like so many others.  
 Beware of these juvenile moron fanatic western so-called researcher reviewers etc who are incapable of anything remotely called as reality or truth or mind or intellect or refinement. Their pathologically sick megalomania and perverted lack of culture refinement or anything more than body hungerness, philistinism and vulgar slavery of animality under hypocrisy of humanitaies or humanity or intellect or research - debares them from appreciating or finding or learning or studying or bringing any reality whatsoever. Not only that they then blame others for their traits.    What does this mean? This means that Dr.White or such little reviewer supporter lack the zeal refinement will mind intellect or spirit to even appreciate or understand TANTRA or reality or TRUTH or anything that is beyond philistinism or body. Yet their megalomania prevents them from admiting this. They reduce everything to materialistic barbarous addicted attachemnt.   Not only that they are so much fanatic that they lack the mind to even appreciate or understand constructive criticism of their faults. Not only that they are so much hypocritic that they blame other for their traits. CLASSIC CASE OF POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK! Those who lack mind talk of protocols of critical mind. Those who react fanatically to criticism want  appreciation of criticism lol. What a joke?!   Research? The reality wherein TRUTH has been handed out from GURU TO SISYA as practical tradition where people live their traditions rather than writing it. How much right it is to ignore these people under the illusion megalomania and fanatism of  non-existant 'humanitarian mind' or illusory 'critical-mind' ? How right it is to lament your juvenille hallucination interpretations which are not at all in accordance either with history or living tradition or reality or truth or even scriptures as TRUTH and lament anybody critcising it as unable to appreciate it or lacking critique mind or humanitarian discipline. Aren't such utterance themselves proof of WESTERN or RESEARCHERS or so-called REVIWERS, ignorance of reality, lack of mind, lack of critique mind that can even appreciate protocol of humanitarian discipline, lack of intellect or spirit or heart or will to understand the real scriptures or interpretations or traditions, or lack of mind to appreciate criticism or understand it?    The reality where words change meaning in 50 years! Where words can be interpreted in different way?! How right it is to trust words when reality was handed down not in words but in initiation in real practise?!!!    In short these writers and reviewers are in fact fanatic political vandalistic vendata barbarous boors who in totality reprsent the WEST and its juvenille intellect under the hallucination of 'RESEARCH' 'INTELLECTUAL' etc, who seriously lack any spirit to go beyond juvnille intellect, who lack any mind whatsoever to understand or work in GURU-SISYA TRADITION, who lack the reality and will to actually travel the path or study it and who are lazy enough to actually travel or 'study' it.    In fact such researchers and reviewers always make '10%-baked' not even 'half-baked' attempts to harp on these 'ULTIMATE TRUTHS' for strenghtening their egoes popularity and money. They lack the will and work required to actually live or 'study' the tradition or reality and find the truth OR STUDY and make '10%-baked' attempts to gain money name fame or satisfy their perverted egoes and slavery of 'juvenille addiction to words'.   BEWARE OF THESE ORGANISED clandestine ATTEMPTS OF CHURCH AND CHRISTIANS to DEGRADE DEFAME and DERAIL  ANYTHING 'HINDU' OR 'REAL'! BEWARE OF THESE surreptitious ATTEMPTS OF REDUCING ANYTHING 'HUMAN' OR 'SPIRITUAL' to the levels of 'animality' and 'philistinism' and BODY! BEWARE OF THESE ATTEMPTS of reducing anything GOLD or diamond to ashes or graphite. BEWARE OF these attempts to reducing the godly to trival.    That is not to say that body fluids or sexual things were not used etc but there was total sciene of it and it was definately not the 'philistine' or 'non-spiritual' and had great clear science meaning and still has. IT IS DEFINATELY not the WAY it is UNDERSTOOD or PORTRAYED.  UNFORTUNATELY ALL WESTERN RESEARCHERS LACK THE STUDY AND WILL TO STUDY these things and are incapable to even UNDERTAKE or UNDERSTAND IT because of their lack of brain heart and soul for the same.    What these means is? We have a person who tastes sugar. Then we have fools like White who write about taste of sugar without actually tasting it. And then there are morons like 'a reader' of 'beware of other reviwers' who would like us to trust WHITE as authority on the taste of sugar rather than the direct experience or those who have experienced? GOT IT? And again these morons fanatic barbarous philistine inhuman boor animal morons would blame others for their traits!    Moreover they would like to divide INDIANS or PEOPLE through their 'DIVIDE and RULE' POLITICS under the hallucination of 'scholarism' 'intellectualism' etc...    [... 
 This book is so beautiful on the outside it's a pity that the words are so incredibly hurtful and wrong.  The story is about a fish who is covered with beautiful scales.  Another fish comes up and asks to be given one of the scales and the beautiful fish says no, after which none of the other fish will play with it.  The fish is advised by someone "wise" to give away its beautiful scales so that the other fish will like it.  It follows that advise and gives every other fish a scale so that by the end of the book the page is filled with a bunch of pathetic looking fish that all have one shiny scale and everyone is supposedly happy.  For me this is a terrible moral!  It's wrong to be prettier or smarter or more talented in some way?  You should try to make yourself less pretty or dumber or ignore your talents so other people won't be jealous?  It's OK to demand other people give you things that you covet?  Yuk! 
 Mini DV cams are better, and should cost about the same. This particular camera has poor quality video and it is a pain to get video transferred to your computer. The software is glitchy, so you'll probably end up downloading drivers yourself. Find a different camera

     I was buying something on Amazon and I was informed that for an additional $5.01 purchase I would get the free super saver shipping so I browsed the cheapie DVDs looking for something palatable and I found this DVD compilation and bought it. because of Virus or "Fukkatsu no hi" as the 3 hour Japanese version was called.     Originally I saw Virus on Showtime in the 80's it ran 2 hours 10 minutes and wasn't bad even though as I understand it an hour of Japanese scenes and dialog had been removed.. The special effects were TV quality but the storyline was good. I have been telling friends about it for years and they wanted to see it. I've searched for the original version but I  only found it on Japanese websites at a cost of over $60 US. (At that exchange rate no wonder the Japanese take month long golfing vacations in Hawaii).     When the order arrived after 3 weeks and not the 10 days advertised by Amazon, my wife and I planned on watching Virus that night. What a disappointment. The picture was so dark that we had to crank up the brightness and picture quality on our 32 inch JVC to the maximum setting. I knew that there would be a major reduction in quality when compressing 6 hours onto a 4.7 GB DVD but it was degraded further because The transfer was done from a well worn print or overplayed tape.      To our further disappointment many of the more poignant scenes had been deleted. Gone were the Tokyo hospital scenes where only four nurses were left to care for the thousands of dead or dying. Gone was the scene where the Japanese Antarctic station made radio contact with a young American boy who was the only survivor in his town. All gone because the film had been cut to 107 minutes!.     We haven't watched the other two "classics" as yet. Maybe we haven't been bored sufficiently with our 500 Dishnetwork channels or maybe its because we are avoiding the inevitable. Whichever it is after we finally watch the last movies we'll use the disk as a coaster or toss it in the local Salvation Army donation bin. Either way my money is gone and when I place my next order with Amazon I'll skip the Super Saver shipping thank you very much. 
 here's a case of a someone trying to capitalize of someone's good name. don't buy this if you care about fair artist treatment 
 I purchased these ear buds to replace those that came with my 80gb ipod expecting them to at least be comfortable.  I can't judge if they are more comfortable or not because they won't stay in my ears long enough to decide.  Even when I'm sitting still on the sofa, they fall out...none of the sizes work for me!!!  If falling out of my ear isn't bad enough, the sound is not even half as good as that produced by the stock ear buds.  Very disappointed! 
 Mr. Reichheld has impressive credentials and I respect his intentions, yet in this book he recommends using poorly-developed surveys to understand customer or employee loyalty.  That's extremely misleading!  That process and the results gained will only mislead management and will not truly indicate how loyal customers or employees really are.  The only true way to understand and manage customer or employee loyalty is to talk to them and let them express their own thoughts! Mr. Reichheld has missed the mark 
 Musicals are historically slight in the plot department, and this movie is no exception.  Three stars: one fading, one rising and one coasting do not help matters either.  Rita is the fading star.  It was painful for me to watch the once dazzling love goddess reduced to playing the controlling widow.  The make up department probably had to work overtime trying to cover the circles under her eyes, and her hair and costumes are just bad.  Novak is the rising star, although I don't get the 50's obsession with bubble headed, busty, bleach blond bimbos.  It would help if she could act, but sadly her range is very limited. I truly believe they added the dog to help make her character sympathetic, since she was unable to convey it herself.  Then there is Frank just coasting on his charm and cool.  Doesn't seem plausible that a hep cat like him, who could bag any "doll", "dame" or "mouse?", would fall for either of these gals.  Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because of Snuffy the dog.  He stole every scene he was in.  Although that wasn't too difficult to do in such a dog of a movie 
 I can't use this on bracelets, it makes them too big and they slide off my wrist.  Also, the clasp is really heavy so if I use it on a necklace, it is always hanging in front, and it is not attractive.   Waste of money, I have never actually used it.

 Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original. Spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles. It might have had some value when it first hit the stands, but who wants yesterday's papers? 		C    Tom Rya 
 Jackson's ego is so overinflated that true knowledge of beer is obscured by his presence.  This book is boring, silly, and a waste of money.  It is also, like its author, shockingly overrated 
 I bought this book expecting it to be as wonderful as French Chic by fashion writer Suzanne Somer (unfortunately out of print) or A Year of Style by Frederic Fekkai.  Unfortunately, this book is filled with dated clothing and very little substance to explain the French fashion mystique.  However, there are two other great books that are keepers.  The first is Frederic Fekkai: A Year of Style.  The famous French stylist does an excellent job of showing you how to be beautiful with easy and simple ideas to use throughout the year. The second book is A Guide to Elegance: For Every Woman Who Wants to Be Well and Properly Dressed on All Occasions by Geneviere Antonine Dariaux.  Madame Genevieve Antoine Dariaux, former directrice for Nina Ricci shares her extensive expertise on creating the classic French look 
 On one hand, this book makes useful points and divorce and its impact on children and offers better alternatives. The problem with it is that most of the evidence is anecdotal. I don't think a lot of the problems the people in the book had were due to divorce, but to the way their parents handled the divorce. Many of them either leaned on their children too much for support or they went from giving their children attention and affection to ignoring them in favour of work and other mates. A lot of the problems could have been lessened with more care. Especially in the case of the fellow who had a congenital heart defect. He needed attention and help, he didn't need to be shunted off to the side. I'm also reading about attachment issues and how they can impact a person from the time they are a baby to an adult. If a person has to divorce, they should ask themselves if it is the right thing to do and if all other options have been exausted. Forcing people to stay together in a stagnating marriage seems a bit cruel to me, like in the case of the intact family she used as an example.  Also, I do not agree with her stating that children don't notice the tention and fighting in their family. They do. Children notice more than people give them credit for. Like so many experts she paints with too broad a brush. She uses too many generalizations. It lessens the impact of her argument. But, a lot of the advice she gives to the system could be used to make divorce easier on parents and children. Divorce isn't going away anytime soon, but, with responsibility and care perhaps it can be easier on children. It is hard for children to adapt to changes. I suggest looking at the advice she offers, but question her methods and conclusions 
 The book was never delivered.  On July 25, 2006, Amazon unilaterally elected to cancel the order that it could not fill since June 4, 2006.  I was then asked on August 1, 2006, to provide comments on a book that was never delivered.  Brilliant, wouldn't you agree? I am sure it must be a wonderful text, if only I could read it....if delivered, I would probably raise my rating by several stars.. 
 At best, this is an oversimplified rehash of Betty Edwards', "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain." As a much better alternative to both of these books, look into Brenda Hoddinott's, "Drawing for Dummies." Brenda's method is very methodical and step-by-step, not to mention fun and a little silly,(just like Brenda!) whereas this particular book calls for a "If you only look at what your drawing, it will be easy!" attitude. Nothing truly worth doing is easy. Check out Ms. Hoddinott's Drawspace.com website as well. You won't be sorry you did 
 If you'd like a glossed over review of making a movie this might interest you but if you have any knowledge about the abyss, its creatures or the vents which have been known now for more than 25 years, this book will leave you disappointed. The few images of the creatures are poor, especially when taken by a 70mm IMAX which is 4 times the size of a 35mmm slide. The lack of creatures shown, the poor descriptions of them , etc. make for armchair reading that will put you to sleep unless you're enthralled by the California mystique of a director's name and little substance. I doubt I'll see the film either. When I buy something about the sea or other natural subjects I expect to learn something from it, not be poorly entertained. The references to Europa and its possible ocean are interesting but would go better with a book of some substance about its main subject 
 There's no use beating about the bush: With crooner husband Marc Anthony at her side, Jennifer Lopez has at last made her big splash into Spanish-language pop. A splash of soulless stagnation, that is. "Como Ama Una Mujer (How a Woman Loves)" makes a better coaster for dinner parties than a CD for the stereo. Bought digitally, it would be truly worthless.  Granted, everyone knows that Jennifer Lopez is no Julie Andrews when she opens her mouth, but she is no Jimmy Durante either. And what was the secret to his success as a singer? Not vocal agility, but a strong personality, the ability to inflect emotional depth and sincerity and an indefinable passion that makes a performer unique. Lopez lacks these attributes here, so the output has no worth.  Though her debut album "On the 6" is a pleasant if already dated look back at late 90's English-language Latin pop, her subsequent records have been guilty pleasures at their best and pop schlock at their worst, with the latter predominating. In fact, no trace of genuine Latin instrumentation has been heard since that first album, doubtlessly due to Ricky Martin being the flavor of the month at the time of its release. Accordingly, the transition from the faux-urban hip-pop and slinky Middle-Eastern tinged radio drivel that marked 2005's "Rebirth" is indeed an eyebrow-raiser.  That she is not fluent in Spanish certainly shows in her vocal delivery, but the tepid songs don't help. Lead single "Que Hiciste (What Did You Do?)" sounds promising when it bursts into a rhythmic riot of Spanish guitars and winning instrumentation but ultimately sinks like a pound of lead. Going off in too many directions at once, it becomes embarrassingly scattered and awkward.  A few songs in, it becomes evident that the disc is too heavy on the ballads; nearly every song sounds like a banal Telenovela theme, and most drag on for so long they can only be described as cumbersome. The six-minute title track drifts away like cotton candy, and the more urgent ballads sound more self-important than sincere, reaching their culminations with nary an impressive moment. "Tu (You)" in particular is significant since Lopez attempts to hold notes that require sufficient vocal flair. The result is the sound of a train as it fast approaches a station, screeching against the rails.  The disc concludes with "Adios (Goodbye)," a supposed live recording with a super-imposed crowd and a giggling Lopez. This is ironic from a singer who has never toured and has cracked her voice during numerous televised performances. This selection would be a fine listen in the hands of a more capable singer.  Love her or hate her, Jennifer Lopez has star quality that shines through on even her most mediocre projects, but that lucky streak has hit a murky end with "Como Ama Una Mujer." A much better purchase would be "Amor Prohibido (Forbidden Love)," the final full-length album from Selena, whom Lopez was privileged to portray in her eponymous 1997 biopic. For something more current, "Fijacion Oral Vol. 1" by Shakira, who deserves commendation for being her own writer, still sports dizzying musical heights two years after its release. The difference is not just in the material, but in the passion. 
 I bought this book brand new, and every page I have turned has fallen out.  It does NOT use algebraic notation, and it is a much bigger nuisance than some say.  There's nothing more frustrating than looking to the solutions page after being stumped for twenty minutes plus, only to have to interpret each move of the solution.  Some of the problems are absurdly difficult (I'm about a 1500 player) and thus a waste of time since you don't learn anything from a seven move combination that only a master could spot.  This was my third tactics book, and remains the only area of chess where I can't improve.  As for telling you the theme involved, it actually made it harder for me to solve problems because it put blinders on me to other elements of the position.  One problem presented a pin, and the first move was to make a mating threat on the far side of the board.  I was so fixated on the pin I never even considered the correct move.  In every other area of chess we are taught principles that guide intelligent play.  But in tactics it's just "Here's a thousand problems.  Fail for long enough and you'll get slightly better."  Don't expect much improvement from this book.   
 This program is evil. It is easy to get sucked into watching Gantz, because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters, who have all died, find themselves in. They have gone to purgatory, and purgatory is like an all-too-real video game. One feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries.  The art direction is decent. Visually, it doesn't look cheap. The English voice acting is embarassingly bad, especially the main character, but not as bad as the dialogue, internal and vocalized, that this character has been given to speak.   The worst thing about this series, apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners, is the "action" scenes. These inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do, when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands, and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow. After you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video, if you don't feel like banging your head against the wall, you are made of stronger stuff than I.   This first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and more frustration than satisfaction. Save yourself the pain. 
 Although I appreciate Whitaker's thorough historical account of the abuses that have been perpetrated upon psychiatric patients, and I wholeheartedly agree that pharmaceutical companies skew the information presented to the public in the name of making money, I take serious issue with Whitaker's sweeping generalizations when it comes to psychiatric medications.  As someone who has been on psych meds for over a decade, I know firsthand how severe the side effects can be.  I also know that they keep me out of the hospital and out of jail, both places I have ended up while severely manic and unmedicated.  To reduce it to the simplest terms possible: while unmedicated, I have made multiple suicide attempts in the throes of bipolar depression.  While medicated, I  hold a job, support myself, cultivate friendships, and live a life relatively free of symptoms.    The point where I really took offense to Whitaker's diatribe was when he negated E. Fuller Torrey's statement, in the well-written, well-researched "Surviving Schizophrenia," that "there is no doubt antipsychotic medications work."  Of COURSE they do.  In his rabid quest to reveal the drug companies as nothing more than contemporary snake oil vendors (I couldn't help imagining the president of Eli Lilly cackling and twisting the ends of his handlebar moustache), Whitaker completely disregards one very simple truth: if antipsychotic medications help even ONE patient to have a life free of terrifying delusions and hallucinations, they have some merit, however dubious.    The most egregious fault of "Mad in America," however, is Whitaker's complete neglect to offer treatment alternatives to neuroleptics.  If "loving" unmedicated schizophrenics in experimental treatment facilities such as Soteria doesn't work, and drugs don't work, and everybody who says they do is wrong -- well, then what?  This book raises many, many questions that are left unanswered in the wake of Whitaker's rant 
 I felt cheated and ultimately disappointed after reading this book and having spent about 3 hours on it in total. Thank goodness it was a library rental and I had not invested any of my own funds for it. The beginning started out quite suspenseful and had my interest piqued, but the middle section about Bologna (bologne is more like it, if you ask me) dragged on and on with all that useless crap about learning Italian, Mr. Grisham even had the nerve to include all that Italian in there. Backman was not a sympathetic character at all (greedy scum) and I kept hoping that he will get killed so that the story would finally end. And after all, what are the chances that a lawyer will have the skills and smarts necesssary to escape from a hoarde of professional killers hired to do their job? Lame and a sorry waste of my time 
 I wanted to see Natalie Portman in what I thought was a real acting role. The only other movies I've seen her in was Leon the Professional (which I thought she was superb in), and Phantom Movie. I fail to see how she was nominated for best supporting actress in this movie. Maybe it was a weak year in female actors? She did a fine job, but I do not believe it was worthy of being nominated.  Now, onto the movie.  This is basically Seinfeld with big name stars. A pointless movie, that was so slow and no plot... I was sleeping through half the movie, and I lost interest after the introduction of Natalie's ("Alice"). Jude Law did the best job in this wretched film.  He pulled off the "loser character, and failed author mentality."  I don't get this movie, or why it was even made, but, I am not into similar movies.  This movie, supposedly about people who lost love, or was in love...no. I don't think so.  There was no love in this movie.  It was lust, pure teen-age hormones running rampant.  All it lacked were true teenagers.   The chemistry lacked between all of the characters, except between the characters and I did not believe in them.  Other than that... For a brief moment, I did believe in Natalie's Alice and Jude's Dan. Oh well. I guess I don't understand this movie at all, but I also didn't care about them. The characters were despicable and annoying (like Seinfeld).  Oh yes, there were many wasted scenes.  Such as, the photo shoots scenes. Who cares?  Why bother showing that?   As funny as the internet "chatting" scene between Dan (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen), it was almost as meaningless.  Certainly, it was far too long.  The producer, director and scriptwriter should be knocked over the head with such a bad movie.  I don't blame any of the actors at all, they tried their best in their limited functions in this garbage. That said, Natalie Portman needs to use her talents and beauty in better roles.  
 You don't want this one.  Although the fabric is appealing (calm stripes vs. the buzy themes of the other covers) this cover will not fit most shopping carts.  It only fits the carts found at small city super markets.  If you are a suburbian shopper you'll have to spend the bucks for  a more satisfactory product 
 We were one of the first to purchase this powerful little battery operated train.  At first my two year old loved it and I was surprised how many trains it could pull behind it.  The honeymoon soon ended, however, when two days later it needed a new battery.  Eight batteries and fifteen days later, the train stopped working (except for the little light on the front) and my son was very sad.  Great idea, but bad product.  We also purchased the larger battery operated red locomotive train which still works great 
 everything in this book is common sense.  There is really very little to learn from this, and it is overpriced 
 When one walks into a movie theater, they expect to see a movie.  When one walks into a pizzeria, they expect to be served pizza.  When one plays paintball, you should expect to be hit by at least one paintball.  So, one could draw the conclusion that when one reads any of Neil Gaiman's Sandman series, you should expect to be pulled into a bizarre world where your heroine (or dark figure leading the show) happens to be the actual Sandman ... right?  Apparently, the answer is closer towards the "no" theory than one could expect.  I understand the concept of building a stage and allowing readers to see the entire universe, and not just one small figure, but that isn't why I purchased this series.  I purchased it for the sole reason that I enjoyed the first two in this collective series.  I find the character of the Sandman to be one of the greatest literary figures in graphic novels today.  His words will entice, his patience will amaze, and his strength will force you to think of Superman as the weakest man alive.  The Sandman is intelligence, boldness, and heroics all boiled together into one shaded character.  He is the epitome of "cool", if one were to phrase it that way.  Yet, why would anyone who loves this series think that without the main character, the central focus of the show, would a series be able to survive?  If I had started with this collection, I don't believe I would have gone any further.  I know, I seem to be an odd voice in this collection that seems to have garnered award after award for possibly the dullest story ever dreamed by Gaiman.  For those fan boys out there that are drooling over the ingenuity of "A Midsummer Night's Dream", I would say - not rudely - but get over it.  Sure, there were moments of fun and inspiration, but for the most part this story seemed to go on longer than needed and gave this avid Sandman reader a chance to catch up on some well deserved rest.  I had seen Gaiman twist the story of Shakespeare earlier in one of the early collections (I think it was when the Sandman was talking with his "friend", Hob Gadling), but I didn't think he would dedicate half a collection to the birth of an idea.  Again, I am not knocking the creativity of the piece, because I saw the premise well, it just felt overly-dramatic coupled with an overall sense of "blah".  It was too much for this reader to enjoy.  I wanted the fantastical coupled with sinister, and before you say it, this just didn't have it.  Sure, there were creatures, but they did not come anywhere close to what I witnessed in the first two collections.  I just missed the tone that Gaiman had captured with his creation in the first two collections; obviously this was a completely different step.  How did I enjoy the other stories?  I thought that "A Dream of A Thousand Cats" was decent, but again lacking that panache that lingered from the first two books.  "Facades" was utterly fun, but diabolically confusing.  Who remembers Element Girl?  To me, it just seemed too outdated for the rest of the series.  My personal favorite was "Calliope", a truly frightening tale of imagination that reminded me of why I am such a big Gaiman fan.  It was dark and spooky all at the same time.  It was the epitome of what the Sandman represents, then we are left with nothing more a ramshackle of other stories that don't fit the bill.  They were a hit or miss with me, as I have read, it seems to be the case with other Gaiman fans.  I wanted, and desperately needed, more Sandman.  I wanted my character back.  I wanted something to breathe life back into this short collection.  For those of you wondering where most of the pages remain, there is a huge development of the "Calliope" story at the end which nearly takes up 20 pages.  This was a waste of time and space.  Obviously, this was the weakest link pertaining to the series.  Overall, I cannot suggest this book to friends or family.  If one asks which collection they should start learning about our heroine, the Sandman, in Gaiman's eyes, I would tell them to stay clear of this collection.  Dream Country may be giving us a hit of what is to come, but for me it felt tired, bored, and over inflated.  While "Calliope" will pull you in, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" will confuse you to the point of insanity, or at least give you a good nights rest.  Dream Country was weak, and it is obvious with the fact that there was what I like to call "filler" at the end of the collection.  If one doesn't have anything worth saying, don't waste my time.  This collection will anger any fans of the series that loved the first two.  Read through this one quickly, and get to the next.  I promise ... it will only get better from here.    Grade: ** out of **** 
 I couldn't even finish this book. Meisner makes acting (acting school in this case) sound like an absolute nightmare!  The book's setting is an acting school, where he is (supposedly) training students to be actors. Instead, he keeps letting students go despite their dedication to their craft, and deciding for them they just "aren't cut out to be actors".   While I thought some of his insight on acting was helpful (living truthfully under given imaginary circumstances); I found the book negative, condescending, and discouraging. Awful, actually. There are much better books about acting 
 ...and use the techniques in this book on the book itself.  Sadly, a book with so much promise falls victim to its own PR machine all too often.  Face it, if you're going to use critical thinking, use it consistently.  If you use it against what you don't like, but cast a blind eye on things you are passionate about, how critical is that, really 
 This book is written well enough that one might overlook the numerous flaws in Mr. Siegel's case.  This case, while sometimes compelling, is far too often flawed.  Simplistic logic seems to be Mr. Siegel's forte - that  is, he takes things as cause and effect without offering proof of any  assocation.  He argues, for instance, that Cuomo's building of prisons  lowered the crime rate and Reagan's deregulation led to economic growth.   Proof behind either statement is lacking, as it is throughout this book.   For a history, this was also majorly flawed in that it did not identify  sources - where does Mr. Siegel get the few statistics he puts in the book?   Demonizing conservatives and liberals also seems to be Mr. Siegel's strong  suit, as this avoids the need to offer a comprehensive ideology of his own.   I did learn more about all three cities from this book but cannot be sure  how much is definitively true due to the large amounts of spin.  Worth  reading, but do so critically 
 We received 2 sets of these glasses for a wedding gift exactly 2 years ago. We LOVE the look of them. HOWEVER - we only have 3 tall glasses left (out of 16 in only 2 yrs!!). They crack in the same place when getting ice out of our refrigerator's ice machine!! The crack occurs in the widest (and weakest) area of the glass. This has happened with 2 different refrigerators we've had. We've also had 2 of the glasses crack in the same place in our dishwasher - and they weren't crowded together at the time. We won't be buying these glasses again despite their great appearance. We will be sending a complaint letter to the company as well. <br /> 
 Having read over 20 biographies of TR over the years, I would have to say that this is the worst. The author utterly fails to assess TR in his "context", though she claims that this is her intent. She judges TR based on modern, "politically correct" sensibilities, and, naturally, finds him wanting. This book is more appropriate as required reading in the Women's Studies department at Wellesley College than for a student of history or devotee of TR 
 This may be a good SD, don't know because the company would not allow shipment to Hawaii.  Therefore ordered the Viking SD and it has been a very good SD 
 I bought this book because the authors are very interesting and unusual people.  Ray Kurzweil is one of few genuine geniuses of modern technology, and Dr. Grossman seems a very engaged and knowledgeable physician with a prevention-based practise, which I applaud.  It quickly became evident that Ray Kurzweil has a major impetus towards this topic of life extension because of a family history of disease and early death- but, hey, he's not that different from any of us.  I myself am a boomer who would really like to find some ways to live as long and healthily as possible, and I'm sure the audience of similar boomers is quite substantial.  That is why there are quite a few books similar to this one appearing.  I have read several of these books, am in the medical field, and am quite familiar with the literature on health and life extension.  The basic problem with this and many other books is that a program is offered after some discussion of the topic (often very selective) but the program is NOT supported by anything like sufficient evidence to merit its adoption.     I could enlarge on this about a lot of areas of this book, but just to give one example is the issue of supplements.  Ray takes about 260 pills a day, and Dr. Grossman about 60 (apparently they don't quite agree).   It is very hard to know if these supplements are going to help you, and, importantly that they won't harm you.  Just to give an example, even the supplements which would have appear most promising, antioxidant vitamins C and E, have been studied in appropriate trials, and have given very mixed results.   In one study, antioxidants of various types were  tested  to see if they would reduce lung cancer incidence.  One antioxidant was associated with a HIGHER incidence of lung cancer.  Supplement with care.  In the end, what can you do?  Well, you can be sure you never smoke, do not allow yourself to become obese, eat a nutritious balanced diet, get regular aerobic exercise, and keep engaged and purposeful as possible in all aspects of your life.  You can't write a book and just have this one sentence, but it appears to be the truth at the present time.  The future- nanotechnology molecular machines zipping around our bodies finding and zapping tumors and so on may happen- but don't hold your breath.  This is interesting speculation, but you may not see it until 100 (or 1000) years from now, if ever 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 George DeWolfe is an internationally recognized photographer. He is well known for his workshop on the master print, and I believe this book is based in part on this course. (I have not taken the course.)   It's important to realize that this book was written by a photographer with decades of experience in darkroom work. Thus visual evaluation of prints is paramount to obtaining his desired result. So DeWolfe recommends leaving auto settings off, and your eyes and brain to 'see' the print. The workflow he presents uses an approach I have not seen elsewhere, and my initial trials are very pleasing. He suggests that in Adobe Camera Raw, saturation be reduced to -100 to view a B&W version of the image, and adjusting to achieve the best image based on luminance values. Saturation is restored afterward. This makes perfect sense photographically, and it works! With too many Photoshop books being written by Photoshop gurus with little talent in photography, this is a breath of fresh air!  What disappoints here is that there are so few examples in the book on evaluating images. This is clearly DeWolfe's strong point and more would have been better. Indeed, he shows a number of "images from hell" he uses in his workshops to show case what can be done with his technique, but these are not included with the book, or available on his web site. He also describes a process he calls outlining, but unfortunately there are no explicit details.   In general, I would say that the author has assembled a collection of Photoshop techniques he has learned to use very well, and, of course will work for the reader. Many go back several versions in Photoshop, but are no longer current or best practice. For example, he describes a workflow which creates a set of layers for global, local and defect correction, based on a layer copy of the original image. This should lead to non-destructive adjustments, and in fact he recommends saving this layered version in case future adjustments are necessary. However, in one example, he applies separate balancing corrections to the left and right sides of image copy layer directly then saves the file. Neither of these changes can be re-adjusted individually, other than by adding more corrections on top, or deleting the layer copy and start over. It is quite possible to make identical adjustments using the gradient / mode technique on real layers that can be individually changed later.   This book promotes the use of a few specific tools, especially Optipix 3.1, to achieve certain outcomes that would usually require tedious and repetitious effort to achieve. I have no problems with this since several additional tools, as well as comparable Photoshop features are also discussed. An Optipix Demo is available for download and evaluation. Such time saver tools are wonderful if they meet your expectations.  His discussion of interpolation to larger image sizes is based on comparisons of third part tools with the Photoshop "bicubic" interpolation method. But Photoshop CS2 has a new and much better tool for this called "bicubic smoother" that improves greatly on bicubic. Thus you might be mislead into using a tool that is less capable than Photoshop. Again, trial versions will be useful before purchase.  The author devotes some attention to correcting color casts and white balance in Photoshop, an important and frequently needed adjustment. He totally omits any discussion of the use of gray cards in the establishment of more exact settings. While final white balance and color are always the prerogative of the artist, this seems really strange for an Ansel Adams 'trainee'.   Overall, I find the book decidedly under-edited. There are several areas where the reader can become confused. Pages 142 and 143 describe adjustment of overall contrast and brightness for grayscale images. However the resulting image has a distinct color cast vs the original gray. Looks very much like a selenium toned B&W print! Perhaps this is the intent, but it is not described as such. Pages 144 to 147 show a similar adjustment for color (RGB) images, yet the image appearing in the channel clipping displays is not the image being adjusted. Go figure.  On page 59, the use of a Wrattan 90 to previsualize contrast is described. This technique is well known. (Ansel Adams has given similar tools to his workshop students.) But the original photograph shown, as we discover later on page 178, is not the original image, but one greatly modified though the suggested workflow. So what is the Wrattan 90 really doing?   So, two stars for the fine and unique content provided by DeWolfe on visualization and use of desaturation in the image work flow. Follow his Photoshop technique initially, but read elsewhere for finer control in Photoshop. Let's hope the second edition has more DeWolfe!  
 First and foremost this book is listed as a "hardcover" edition. This collection, in point of fact, consists of 4 paperbound books with a cardboard slipcover.  Secondly, there are no traditional recipes with a list of ingredients followed or accompanied by instructions for preparing the dish. "Recipes" are one paragraph descriptions that list the amount, the ingredient itself, and directions all in the same sentence. Regarding the structure of the individual volumes (Meat, Poultry & Game, Fish & Seafood, Vegetables & Salads, and Desserts) they are divided into chapters covering a major subgroup. For example, in the Meat Volume there is a chapter on Chicken. Within each chapter recipes are listed alphabetically. The authors, in my opinion, have haphazardly mixed recipe titles to include usage of english and foreign names. For example, there is a recipe titled "Chicken Liver Flan Chavette" indiscriminately mixing english, spanish and french terms.   The recipes themselves leave a lot to be desired. As an example the above cited "Chicken Liver Flan Chavette" recipe starts out: "Bake a flan case (pie shell) blind. Thickly slice 500 g (18 oz) trimmed chicken livers. Season and saute in hot butter." There are no cross references to where the recipe for a flan case appears (which it doesn't as far as I could find) and the instructions to saute in "hot butter" are useless. It would be more instructive if the authors had considered a statement such as "saute over medium heat until golden brown". Very little thought and testing was used to list these recipes.  I would give this book a "0 star" rating if it were available!      
 I find it horrifying that the techniques of pseudoscience can be used so slickly that even educated readers may think it is sound.  It is easy to support any view when your data is cherry-picked or outright untrue (e.g. that all observed mutations lose information content) 
 When I traveled in Japan with a friend, this was the book we brought with us.  Within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in Tokyo looking for a better one.  There are some things this guide does quite well -- it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country, and the advice to get a JR pass was invaluable.    However, the book has a very negative, immature view of Japan as a country and travel in general.  It seems to be written by bitter expatriates with a fascination with gaijin bars and the sex trade.  Did I pay $1200 for plane tickets to go drink with Americans?  The authors express a bias against culturally interesting sites, ancient and modern, that borders on the anti-intellectual.  The cultural notes are dated, inaccurate, and shallow.  After a while, we began to think, "If Lonely Planet doesn't recommend it, it's probably interesting."  The maps, as many have mentioned, are almost useless.  Ironically for a series which fetishizes getting off the beaten path, it's practically useless once you get out of the main tourist areas.   There are much better guides available.  This entry has sworn me off the LP series for life.  
 I found the dvd boring. The visuals were the same kaleidoscope over and over. The title of the dvd has nothing to do with the content.I didn't find any exotic robotics in it. This dvd you will view once then put it away. Actually you may not want to watch it even once. I don't recommend purchasing this unless you are a hardcore trance listener. The trance music is ok but the visuals are hard to watch after a few minutes 
 Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their return/replacement deadline.  Shouldn't a cell phone battery last longer than a month??  They refuse to refund or replace.  They are a shady company and I'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same 
 Awful.  If it was possible to get a zero, this book would deserve it...Material might be interesting if it was presented in a "manly" manner, at least readable...It's the same stuff over and over again, as if the author is trying to convince himself...  A book on "Manliness" ought to be manly, straight forward, tell it like it is and move on...readers and critics be damned, take it or leave it...this book is any and everything but that, and this critic chooses to leave it and suggest that you do the same...  The author's points are "manly" in one important aspect (at least to the academic world).  He goes against "political correctness" and takes a stand against what is considered "acceptable thought..." Three cheers for him on this point...but if he really wanted to make his point, he should have written a "book," not a bulky unreadable dissertation...Little wonder that it is #9,151 on the Amazon Best Seller List and, most likely, dropping fast.      Having said all of this, to be fair, I must point out that our men's book club had a most lively discussion about this book.  Only two people had struggled through the book (two out of nine), but the ideas in the book provoked great discussion. Unfortunately not much of the discussion was about what was in the book 
 The code examples in this book simply do not work. You have to rely on other books and looking up things yourself on the internet to get the examples working. If I wanted to do that, I wouldn't have bought THIS book!!  Its thourogh in its coverage of DX9, but so are a lot of other books that have code that actually compiles. Don't waste your money. A programming book with programming examples that don't actually work is like a cookbook without any actual recipes. Useless 
 I think Dr. Laura should title her next book "The Secret of My Success: Stupid People."   Julie Townsend, Metairie, L 
 Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started.  Hagstrom's book is a poorly executed fifth grader's book report on the primary investing philosophy of Buffett.  Don't waste your money here.  You'll regret it.  This doesn't even really scratch the surface of relevant information 
 THERE WAS NO DOUBT I WASN'T WARNED BEFORE PURCHASING THIS, WHAT I WAS GETTING.  IT'S SARCASTIC, PARTS ARE FUNNY, BUT I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO WASTE ANY MORE OF MY TIME BY FINISHING THE BOOK. HOWEVER, HIS BOOK ABOUT THE WOLF & 3 PIGS WAS MUCH MORE CLEVER AND ENTERTAINING 
 This movie is absolutley horrible. I heard it was an underground funny movie and was told it's a must watch. I think the only reason I made it through the whole thing was I kept waiting for the funny parts, next thing I know, the credits were rolling. BLEACH! Amazingly awful 
 CONSTANTINE MAROULIS may be easy on the eyes, but thei s cd is awful.  A bit to hardcore for a debut albumn.  Maybe payback for not getting further in AI, I really think he can sing and does have talent, when he did David Cassidy's I THINK I LOVE YOU, it was a good take on a old 70's song. Then when he did Queens Bohmeian Rhaposdy it sent shivers down my bones, (no Freddy) but not bad. Sorry this is just a disappointment, better luck next cd.  This may have been a let down  to his fans, not to mention that AI  has a large pre teen audience not to mention how many parents would go out and buy this cd, for it surely would have a explicit warning label on it 
 This was the only Bertrice Small book I could find in the gift shop of an airport.  That should have been warning enough not to buy it.  Rosamund was an unlikeable character.  She left her 3 young daughters so she could "make love" constantly and then was oh-so-superior with her maid when Annie did the same!  I guess being a rich, snotty noblewoman means you're not held to the same standards of behavior as the mere household help.  I found the love at first sight meeting to be flimsy and contrived.  Small's readers are smarter than most, so I'm surprised she expected us to swallow it.  Like some other reviewers here, I thought it was more lust than love.  It was clearly a mid-life crisis hook up for Patrick.  And if Rosamund truly loved Patrick, she never would have left him when he was ill, memory loss or not!  Not planning to read either "Rosamund" or "Phillipa", the other books in this series.  It was hard enough getting through this book, let alone another one with her uppity daughter.  The good stuff?  Getting to meet Patrick Leslie again.  But it was heartbreaking to witness his grief over losing his daughter Janet decades ago.  If you've read "The Kadin", you know that Janet eventually returns to her home, but only after Patrick has died 
 I bought this item because of a great price, Amazon shipped it regualr UPS and I received it earlier that expected, the box looked in good shape but when I opened it one of the legs was broken off,I thought at first that it must have taken a pretty good hit to do that, so I called customer service and they sent me a return tag and shipped me a new one right out, I got it, opened it and the exact same thing, box was in good shape but 1 leg was broken, I called customer service and again they shipped another one out, this time second day air. I get the third one and guess what, the exact same thing for the third time! I looked at it carefully and each time it was broken at the weld in two areas on the cooker and it had to have been poor workmanship and quality control, it even looked like it had rusted in one weld! I can't say enough about Amazon's customer service,but I wouldn't reccommend buying the banjo cooker by mail order 
 I previously wrote a pretty harsh review of this book after purchasing it last year. In recent times my opinion of it has changed. The book captures TONS of good thoughts , and has excellent still photos. Its very useful, once you get past the fact that there are no video samples included with the book. I would dare to say that if it were to include such video clips on DVD or multimedia CD, it would become an EXCELLENT learning/reference tool for young directors (etc) searching to master their artform.   If only i could edit this review to say 4 1/2 stars!  < please see my old review below>  'Coffee Table Book - More form than function'  Maybe i am being harsh, but the book seems like an 'artbook' with no tangible vision of how its REALLY supposed to bring knowledge to its readers. Its the prettiest book in the box of ten that i bought last week on Amazon, but its content is suited either for the person with just a passing interest in music videos (like a sunday afternoon coffee guest - "Will she glance at the cosmopolitan or read the Music Video book?" or someone else who has lots time and no specific interest in music videos).   I hardly feel like i am IN the 'minds' of these directors, truly learning from the way they THINK, or other aspects of thier creative story. The book is more like a compilation of 'behind the scenes' glances on 'E' or VH1.   Perhaps including a CD inside the book, with medium resolution copies of all the videos would help a bit. The visual reference would turn each conversation with the directors into a tangible learning experience that anyone with a PC could relate to.   The worst part for me is that most of these videos are of a genre that i dont listen to. I am primarily R&B, Hip-hop, Reggae (Dancehall) by blood and by love. The only people in this book who i listen to are Lauryn Hill and Seal.  I am really disappointed by this book.   Like i said, the book seems like an 'artbook' with no tangible vision of how its REALLY supposed to bring knowledge to its Audience. I am left to wonder who was the target audience?  <old review ends here> 
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 Rio Bravo is a classic. This review isn't about that as everyone knows what they're getting in terms of the film. The movie industry is another matter. I saw a recent debate between a couple arguing about the state of things in the industry and how movie and entertainment comapanies are crying poor. The reason is simple, when you try to rip people off on a consistant basis, you get everything you deserve. There's many areas I could go into detail, but I'll just add my comment regarding the dvd's. How many versions of the same movie can you possibly release? Let's see, there's the original one, the HD version, then (like this one) there's the "special" two-disc set with all the extras they didn't include on the original. But wait, there's more. Next of course will be the new and improved "blue-ray" edition! This one is even better folks! Give me a break. It's time people stopped falling for this crap! Everytime you purchase another version, you're telling these crooks that's it's ok to pull this stuff, and you're also showing just how gullible you really are. This is a form of the oldest selling scam there is. Hold 'em ransom for better versions. No wonder the pirate market is flourishing. 
 This is the only Robert Crais novel I ever read that I didn't like.  I had to push myself to finish it.  It features all the minutia about bank robbing --it's like the author read a book on the subject--  and the least likeable characters he's ever created.    Spare yourself the annoyance of reading this and read "The Watchman" instead.  
 As a committed Journey fan, I was truly looking forward to their new album, only to be gravely disappointed. The first three tracks are nice, as are the last two...the rest has much to be desired.  Gone are the sweeping melodies that typified the Perry era.  Missing is any of the creative orchestration and progressive rock associated with "Dream After Dream" and the "Escape" albums.   The album video said that the band was stretching into new territory - they weren't kidding!  Melodies are rather limiting and repetitive; the band is rather rough around the edges; Tracks 8-11 are very much like "Back Talk," off of the "Frontiers" album; ("Back Talk" is my least favorite Journey tune).  In fact, part of the writing credits go to Steve Perry on "In Self-Defense."  The ballads, with the exception of "Beyond the Clouds" are stagnant and tend to drag on and on and on...you get the picture.  The final drawback is that every member gets a chance at singing.  Remember William Shatner - well, it's not that bad, but didn't they hire Augeri for a reason?  One nice surprise is that Deen Castronovo, Journey's new drummer, sings on two tunes ("Never Too Late," "A Better Life").  Deen has a very strong, "Steve Perry-sounding" voice that fits the Journey mold.  Both of these tunes are great additions to the Journey library.  Schon gives a stellar solo in the former tune - one of his best on the album.  I hope they give Deen the floor more often; however, I can't imagine playing drums live and trying to sing at the same time.  My recommendation is to listen to the album and draw your own conclusions. I'm keeping the album for the few songs that I listed above.  They'll go on a burned compilation CD and the original master will sit on the shelf - until I have to make another CD.  
 Most physicists I know say that while this is not the best of textbooks, it's a great reference.  I sometimes ask them to refer me to a useful section.  They usually can't.  This book is the standard in graduate math courses for physicists.  It's a shame.  We buy this book for the course and then either seek out other texts (or the internet) for elaboration, or more often, we trudge through all the math that Arfken leaves out.  I've rarely used any math not found in this book, but also rarely has this book been useful enough to show me how to use the math.  It's sort of like a dictionary.  Everything is mentioned, but if you want to learn about something, you need to know a lot more than just a definition.  Boaz's undergraduate math book is a good text for this subject.  Unfortunately, it doesn't go in depth enough for all of a graduate course.  For the same price as Arfken, I own about a dozen Dover editions, one for each of the important sections covered in a year long course.  A topic that we thoroughly exhausted but is not taught too often these days is complex analysis and the calculus of residues.  Residues were much more important for solving complicated integrals before computers became so commonplace.  For this, I recommend "Complex Analysis" by Tristan Needham.  It's a tome of all things complex, but if you have the time, or are just curious, it's a great book.  If possible, get a list of alternative sources from you professor before you take the class requiring this book.  Then buy them, do not buy this awful monstrosity. 
 I found after reading the first part of this book i became very depressed.  I had to stop reading it because it made me feel very helpless

 This is supposed to be a travel mug. The closure for the drinking lip attaches to the mug lid with a tension, two bar slip in slot.  In three weeks of daily use the closure came off at least three times per day and finally is lost. A minor bump dislodges the closure.  I wasted my money.  
 The author attempts to overwhelm the reader with endless details from anthropology, history, sociology, psychology, political theory, etc. and endless analysis of factors to discuss the relation of gender and war--all in the service of the white male patriarchal academic establishment.    Meanwhile, under "matriarchies," he has two entries:  "lack of evidence...[and] rhesus monkeys."  He conveniently assumes that matriarchies would have been the mirror image of patriarchies, i.e., amazonian matriarchies, which allows him to exclude discussion of actual matriarchies--at least one of which still persists in the United States today--the Iroquois.  The reader never learns that indeed there were such matriarchies as the Iroquois, where the mothers of the tribe were empowered to make the decision about whether the males would conduct war.  See Doug George-Kanentioo, Iroquois Culture & Commentary (New Mexico:  Clear Light Publishers, 2000).  Nor does the reader learn that there are scholars such as Ifi Amadiume, a Professor at Dartmouth College, who has demonstrated the existence of African matriarchies in many works, especially African Matriarchal Foundations (London:  Karnak House, 1987).

 The author's historiographic slant is extremely conservative. He claims that the portrait of "nuts and bolts plantation operations" in Gone With the Wind, is "right on the money". Reviewing Ken  Loach's Land and Freedom he denies that Franco was a fascist. Of Platoon he  claims that Oliver Stone vastly exaggerates the extent of atrocities like  My Lai. So this is historical film as seen through the eyes of a  "history buff" apparently unacquainted with current history  writing, or even journalistc accounts. Even if the reader sympathizes with,  or is willing to overlook the author's political ideology, ninety percent  of each entry is historical background. So there's really very little about  each film, and far to much of the author's own revision of history. Given  the need for such a book, and the appealing title, "History Goes to  the Movies" is a major disappointment 
 I was ready to order this great movie based on that it's supoosed to be a "Collectors Edition"; fortunately I happened to catch the comment from AP DUPIN from France (these are the really useful comments, Thanks AP!) that the transfer for this version is not anamorphic. Are you kidding? It's the 21st century, widescreen TV's are here! Non-anamorphic DVDs should be clearly marked as NON ANAMORPHIC. At this stage of DVD development, Widescreen Version should imply "Enhanced for 16X9 TVs", unfortunately it doesn't, so widescreen owners should make sure of what they're getting before buying. I just wish that people would include more comments about the quality and characteristics of the DVD itself along with the "artistic" review. In the meantime, I'm passing on this "Collector's Edition"(?) until someone lightens up and gives this movie the DVD treatment it deserves. The movie: 5 Stars; this DVD version: 1 Sta 
 Book one was great, and I felt it followed the biblical story of Rachel and Leah quite well, but this book, book three in the series, it was just so off base with the biblical story.  First of all, Rachel had two children by Jacob, Joseph and Benjamin.  In this book, she cannot have children, but does become pregnant.  Her children dont live!  Why?  Did Liz Curtis Higgs forget about the fact that Joseph and Benjamin did exist?  Honestly, I hope that Grace in Thine Eyes is better than this one was.  I was so disappointed with this book simply because I felt that it didn't do either character, Rose or Leana, justice at all.

 Not what I was expecting.  A little too long also.  It had funny parts and sad parts, but mostly was a little "low budget" and almost put me to sleep.  It was in Dustin Hoffman's early years, so I give him a break there 
 Three years after the first mortal kombat film, fans couldn't wait for Annihilation to come out. Unfortunately, the sequel did not do well at the box office and after viewing it, I can see why. First, I will start with what is positive about the movie. Kitana had more of a role as did Jax, I preferred Sandra Hess as Sonya a little over Bridget Wilson even though she did a good job with Sonya's character in the first movie, some of the fight scenes (Jax vs. Cyrax, Sonya vs. Mileena, Liu Kang vs. Baraka, Sub-Zero vs. Scorpion) were sequenced good, the dvd bonus features were nice, and the soundtrack was awesome. These positive aspects, however, could not save the overall film from disappointment. So what went wrong? Like the first MK, Annihilation attempted to blend two mortal kombat games into one movie (mortal kombat 3 and ultimate mortal kombat 3). Unlike the first MK, however, the blend was not successful. Too many characters were put into the movie and therefore the character development for most of them was almost non-existent. Aside from that, only three of the actors to my knowledge returned from the previous movie though it is understandable why the other actors did not return. What else went wrong with this sequel? Some of the acting was either over-the-top and/or downright pitiful. Shao Kahn's character along with Raiden's character was poorly resembled. Also, some of the characters didn't even get much screen time at all. One flaw that is immediately noticed at the beginning of the movie is that one of the main characters gets killed off (I won't say who because it is probably obvious). While some of the fight sequences were good, most of them were rushed and some were just flat-out ridiculous. This goes double for the animality sequence. Sadly, MK Annihilation doesn't rank up with the first one. Despite all this, there is some good news. After eight long years of waiting, a third mortal kombat film will hit the big screen with most of the actors returning from the first movie. Plus, the third installment will not only kontinue where the first left off but will also ignore the events of Annihilation 
 Last month our bookclub discuss this book, and it was very boring.It most was about other sports not  baskekball which was the story. Bruce Brooks write a book that is  exciting . 
 I'm not going to say I'm a long-time Death Cab fan, but my fondness for the band has led me through their entire catalogue, from Transatlanticism all the way back to You Can Play These Songs With Chords, my personal favorite being We Have The Facts... I tend to prefer lo-fi indie rock, though the sheer strength of Death Cab's songwriting kept me a fan up through Trans.   A lot of people will think I'm ridiculous for saying that this is Death Cab's worst batch of songs ever. Sure, the lyrics for Follow You Into The Dark flow perfectly from one line to the next and are even visually vivid, but it doesn't even sound like Ben Gibbard is trying anymore. It's the distillation of all the clever word-play he's been perfecting over the years, and this is the pinnacle, except the key ingredient - emotional conviction - is noticably absent. That seems to be the best way for me to describe Plans - perfectly clever and absolutely predictable songs that rely on studio polish instead of sincerity.  This is fiction, not fact, for the first time in years.   It's a trait noticable down to the CD cover. Something About Airplanes comes with a textured CD book with holes punched through so you can see the subsequent pages, where-as Plans comes with a glossy, plasticy booklet. It's an entirely different aesthetic at work than on the previous albums that seemed so uniquely vulnerable.   To be fair, there's only one other person I know who detests this album like I do, so odds are, if you're reading this review, you will in fact enjoy Plans. My guess is that most Death Cab fans have already purchased this and made up their minds, or have decided to steer clear altogether. If you heard DCfC on the radio, it's more than likely that big studio productions don't grate on your nerves the way they do on me, so you probably won't have the same qualms with the album I do. I just had to throw in my two cents and hope that some of you will check out Death Cab's earlier work, because this is far far far from their best. And if "lo-fi" scares you, check out The Photo Album. It's a good example of polished integrity 
 Most of the book was very, very good, which is why I gave it 1 star. If it had a bad ending, I would've given 2 or 3 stars. But what we have here is no ending. As a reader, I feel cheated. Since I now wish I never wasted my time reading this, I can honestly say it doesn't deserve more than 1 star, and I think I'm being generous 
 this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me.  this has happened about 4/5 times.  While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do.  sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work.  If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave 
 There was enough redemption and entertainment in the first 2 books to have me reading the third, but what a way for Sinjun to go!  I liked Sinjun, I liked Colin, the Scottish adventure and running away from the overprotective brothers is great... So why does our Strong and Manly hero have to ruin it all by subjugating the eager and talented Sinjun to HORRIBLE sex.  And later in the book when Sinjun decides to "let" her husband hurt her, it's DISGUSTING.  Having a man force sex on a woman is NOT romantic!  Rewrite the book to take out the rape and I would love it 
 The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.    Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.    Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.    And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.    Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".  By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.    This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.  
 I did not like the layout of this book at all--particularly annoying was the fact that you had to turn pages between the "before" and "after" room drawing layouts-they should have been either put on facing pages or on the same page.  Also, her first book worked well because it seemed to focus more on average people with decorating issues, this book was definitely skewed towards people with scads of money like the people with the view home in Laguna Beach, who practically had walls made of windows--hardly what the average person is looking to showcase!  I would borrow this one from the library, but buy her first book 
 The book offers no rigor in any sense and the author seems to have simply copied a large number of formulas from a real probability book. Explanations are sparse and incoherent with vague references to "important applications" with no sense of the abstract concept and virtually no insight into any of the information presented; as another reviewer wrote it is quite dry, I can't see Ben Stein narrating it, but I can picture the author sitting at his keyboard haphazardly plunking in text from other 'sources' all the while wondering what it means.  Skip this and get something with more substance, Peebles offers nothing more than you could find on wikipedia, perhaps less 
 I agree with the last reader.  I didn't finish this book, it was SO boring.  NOTHING happened.  And the characters were annoying.  I read a lot of books that aren't action-oriented and like them.  But this one was  awful 
 I really hate to pan a book because I have a lot of respect for the effort that goes into writing one but do yourself a favor and skip this one.  I purchased it based on the rave reviews below and then when I recieved it I knew immediatly that I had to return it. Illustrator Gone Wild is a sophmoric effort. At best it's worth flipping through while in the book store but it's not worth taking home. If you've bothered to learn Illustrator from a class or a good book, such as Adobe's Classroom in a book series, then you all ready have the skills and knowledge to do everything in the book such as the chapter on making Kiss type. (Which I doubt you'll ever be called upon to do) But if you want to learn something about the details of making clean professional or even attractive art then you'll find this book lacking, as I did. The key thing that interested me in the book was the promised chapter on photo-realism and the review that said this book was like the WoW series only more project oriented. The details on photo-realism were so scant that one could pick up all this book had to say in 30 minutes of trying to trace and color a shiny metal object. This book's similarity to the WoW series ends at being a book with chapters, words and pictures. While it does offer more detail in steps to create art than WoW the projects it offers are the kind of thing you'd do on a Sunday afternoon for fun or for a friend's band who can't afford to pay you but not the kind of thing you'd show at work, in a portfolio or try to sell freelance 
 Ok, first of all, read that ttle again. Don't you love how idiotic grown ups sounds when they try to, like, borrow the vernacular twists of their offspring for ironic employment in a, like, polemical setting? Reminds me of Cusack's dad in 'Better off Dead,' the way he keeps trying to talk to his son on his son's level. There's so much bad faith and pretension permeating this book- it's all there in the title...  As for the' author's "polemic," it basically consits of numerous, misinformed, tendentious tracts soldered together into a rusty heap. You've heard this spiel before, most likely from your grandparents or parents who just don't get it- that they had their time. This is our era. Our use of language reflects and underlines our differences from those who came before.   I particularly didn't like his seeming dismissal/blanket statement on hip hop. He really ain't down with the brothas, which is not surprising, given that he's a black intellectual, and there's nothing established black academics like more than a long-winded, whingeing harangue about the endemic evils of hip hop Kulture. Ugh. He doesn't even seem to possess much of a knowledge of hip hop artists or their work... Nada... There is much that I find execrable in said culture and in it's major 'artists' but still how can one overlook its myriad unifying and artistic elements... Even I manage not to fall prey to an all-too-easy reductionist formula, which seems to be the The main point here- the author views the degredation of the english Language through the lens of pop culture at large (as a bad thing, mind you), it begins in the evil counterculture 60's and... you know...   Digressive, ranting out-of-context mixed with counter-intuitive psuedo-linguistic gibberish. For example, the author holds up both Dylan and Tom waits as examples of artists who are reverred not for their songwriting abilities, but more for their authenticity, thir 'genuineness'. This is plain false. Laughably false. I've never met a fan of either artist who wasn't struck by their strange and completely idiosyncratic use of language. Moreover, the author seems to feel that pop culture music is driven by whites emulating blacks. True, up to a point. I love this stance, and from Chuck Berry to James Brown to Miles Davis to Funkadelic to Fishbone to Bad Brains, to the innumerable black influences on The Clash, I will never tire of pointing out that, basically, it's all black music. One would think that, at least on some level, this is a good thing... But no, it leads back to the counter-kulture (with a k) ideals that have subverted language...????   HUH?  The saddest thing is that, as a reactionary elitist, I'm inclined to agree with many of the author's basic points. But both his presentation and his defense of his points were so hare-brained and wrong, I just felt sullied. With friends like these...  
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 It would be easy to rubbish this book. Even Fleming fans draw back from it a little because it is not really one of the series. It stands apart to some extent as a kind of old fashioned adventure story. It is easy to see why it was chosen to be the first to be filmed rather than Casino Royale - the first in the series. Before `The Spy Who Came in from the Cold" they were doubtful of the appeal of a spy story to a mass cinema audience and hedged their bets by filming the one they felt to be most `mainstream' Once they had picked Dr No the film makers threw away the order of the books and the character development that runs through the series from the vulnerability Bond displayed at the beginning to his nearly total disintegration near the end. The impossibility of the series - that Bond could actually have survived so long when he was a bordering 40 bungler with a fatal flaw in the libido department - is also sidestepped by the films making him out to be a totally different character; a superhero with an impressive range of skills and gadgets that always work! The films are impossible for a different reason; in an age of information technology and universal surveillance with information a salable commodity Bond would only have lasted as long as one assignment before his cover was well and truly blown and he was reduced to appearances on Jerry Springer to supplement his Government Pension. Had the Bond of the books been real he would have been routinely shot by a hired hit man using a telescopic gun sight and nothing more technically advanced than that!   	I have picked Dr No because it is widely regarded as untypical and yet it was the first I read - although I read it before seeing the film. I found the prose stark and simple. Fleming's habit of saying `Bond said' at every utterance reminded me of Janet and John books. But I was captivated by some of his description that seemed to me - at the age of 13 - to be striking and original. I loved the idea of the month of March coming in `like a rattlesnake' or a steel band sounding like `a giant spider dancing on a xylophone' and I was more forgiving then of some of the excesses. Yet I found his stereotyping of Jamaican Quarrel ridiculous "Quick Boss! Dey's a commin'!" - surely it must have been offensive! I was quick to notice that it was not carried over into the film. Although I had  uncomfortable moments when I thought the camera pointed up one or two visual gags - on Quarrel's facial expression at seeing a crab pass close by his face for example. Fleming lays this kind of thing with a trowel. Generally the writing is not just competent, it is stylishly compelling. Fleming is easy to read compared for example to Stephen King. Fleming is the ideal airport author because Bond books are not that long and you can get well into them before your flight is over - perhaps even finish them on a long transatlantic flight; something that must have contributed to the sales. Fleming is undemanding. And he does make one want to know what is going to happen. His characterisation is spartan but this may be a strength in this kind of fiction as male readers will want Bond to be as lightly drawn as possible so that they can easily identify with him while female readers will have their own idea of what Bond looks like.   As for the women - it is possibly not entirely fair to dismiss them as fantasy figures!   I must admit that when I read Dr No for the first time I found Honeychild Rider an interesting role model! The idea of ducking out of school to live by myself in a ruined house, educating myself with an encyclopaedia and assassinating the local sex pests with black widow spiders appealed to my Gothic sensibilities! Had I written the book I would just have given Honey more to do! She obviously had plenty of spirit and was street wise, athletic and should have been pretty good in the jungle warfare department too I would have thought! She is potentially such a good female adventure heroine that it is a disappointment that once Bond turns up her own story is put on hold - so to speak. Of course we might miss this on first reading because we have not seen things from her point of view. But on second reading it becomes a considerable weakness because when she appears we think "Oh yes! She's the woman with the black widow spider and the tough upbringing who goes diving for shells and - wait a minute! Hey! When do we get to see some of that?" By the end of the book she is reduced to polishing the family silver and cooking Bond's supper! By the next book Bond has thrown her over. Her life is ended as far as the reader is concerned. She is relegated to a footnote in Bond's endlessly repeating cycle of `kiss kiss bang bang' as it has been felicitously described!   	In fact Honey is not a typical `Bond Woman' for another reason. She has no relevance to the plot. She is not a `McGuffin' - which the others tend to be. She is not the villain's mistress or the victim of the villain's machinations. She just wanders on, titillates and vanishes. Even the bit of hokum about her sailing up to the beach without lowering her sail and thus showing up on Dr No's radar is only the slightest excuse. She is not even with Bond very much except as window dressing and she might be dead for all we know. Dr No has her tied down in the path of the dreaded killer crabs - and she knows enough about crabs to just go to sleep until they have crawled over her. This book's obsession with wildlife as a matter of execution is another unusual feature. Besides the crab and the black widow; Bond is nearly stung to death by a centipede and almost eaten by a giant squid and Dr No is finally despatched under a pile of seagull droppings! Bond has to crawl through a cage of deadly spiders and then there is the swamp where all three adventurers risk being nibbled to death by all manner of insects and leaches!   	The name `Honey' seems to indicate Fleming's wish to sweeten a bitter pill. He does tend to dwell on the dirty and unsavoury in this story. There is an interesting sidelight that one of his associates cast on this in that when at a beach party a woman he was interested in went behind a rock to urinate Fleming was so shocked that he shunned her from then on! Could this novel - and some of his other literary excesses be an attempted move into cathartic anti-script? There is also the detail of Honey's broken nose. I found it hard to believe that a doctor could not have set it better than he did. Then there is her ambition to make enough money so that she can get her nose fixed and become a `call-girl'. This seems to be Fleming's logic - not hers. Why could she not want to study oceanography or become a tour guide or go into business for herself? The casual way this career idea is introduced does not stand up to examination. Here is a woman who was raped and felt so violated that she took her revenge by murdering her  attacker - who also broke her nose when she tried to resist him! It makes no sense and ignores the deeper damage that rape victims feel that she thinks that all she needs to do is fix the physical damage that the man had done to her and then happily take her place as a willing participant in the institutionalised rape she will find in the sex industry! People do make irrational decisions but this is too casual. It would have been ironic and worth exploring in a story where a woman indeed went down that route. This however implies that it was a conscious choice made out of childhood innocense - and of course sets Bond up as the man who rescues her from her own folly! The book is full of such cringe-worthy moments as this!   The English novelist Kingsly Amis, in his improbably apologetic critique of his hero fails to see why Fleming really did not like women. He points to the affectionate little asides that pepper Fleming's description as if these somehow makes it alright to portray women in such a shallow way. It is fairly obvious that Fleming painted himself into a corner by not giving Bond a female sidekick when he sends him off to his `mysterious island' so he washes one up on to the beach like a piece of driftwood! Then he has to get rid of Quarrel so he has him wiped out by a flamethrower! This is what makes Dr No the most sexless of all the books. It is also perhaps the most revealing. There is an old tradition of this kind of fiction where the characters were exclusively male and the females were merely incidental. Was Fleming perhaps letting us know that he would rather not include women at all 
 Given the nature of things online and how easy it is to misrepresent something as being *THE GREATEST EVER*, I am usually skeptical when any book has glowing reviews and it's only been out less than a month.  I hate to burst the shiny bubble that the other two reviewers have given but Christopher Hart's books are not worth the time or the money for the serious would-be comic book artist or established artist looking to improve.  Don't just take my word for it though go to your local library or bookstore and have a look at Hart's books yourself.  In all of his books on superhero drawing and manga style drawing, you will find no more than 25 pages of artwork done by Hart.  This book I believe only has 16 - 18 pages of art attributed to him out of 144 pages.    So exactly who fills out the rest of Hart's books?  A number of other artists who draw considerably better superheroes and villains in American, Manga and Fusion style than Hart can.  It's a shame those artists don't have their names listed on the book covers.  To even put Hart's name on the cover as though he'd done all the work (or even most of it) is very misleading.  Again, don't just take my word for it, visit your library or bookstore and look for the contributing artists listed in the first few pages of the book.  You will quickly find that Hart is good at drawing very basic and general characters but not the type of superheroes that populate comic books.    Now you might think well if the other artists are pretty good isn't the book still worth it?  No and the reason I say this is because I've seen them and most every one is light on technique and instruction. How light? Try a page or two at best on topics like facial expressions, poses, clothing etc.  There are better books out there which are more in depth and devoted to one or two topics rather than skimming over many as Hart's books do.  I can only guess that the popularity of comic books, comic books turned movies and videogames based on comics has served to fuel the book buying of how-to drawing books that have made Hart a best-seller.  It's also served to prompt many others to toss crappy how-to draw books out there as well.  Sadly, there's at least three worthless drawing books for every solid book on comic book/superhero drawing.  With the string of Hart books coming out seemingly one after another, that ratio of bad over good will only continue to grow.    I just hope that more people discover the truth about books like this one and not buy them sight unseen based on the sales rank or number of glowing reviews. Hopefully the result will be fewer sales and ultimately fewer useless books clogging up the market. 
 And NO I do not agree that the lead female singer was brilliant. She has the same naisely "Disney Mermaid" qualities as everyone else of this generation. Not that I'm expecting Merman, but I grow so weary of witless lyrics and music, and singers who think "Linda Ronstant sings Gershwin" is a golden oldie 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 The book covers many interesting topics, but rather superficially.  It tells you about the various aspects related to design of automatic machinery, but not enough about anything so that you can actually apply it in designing machinery.  Even the case studies do not get to technical details and are mainly descriptive.  So, if you just want to know the names of the various aspects of automation and a description of what the names mean, this book is fine.  If you actually want to design something, it is disappointing 
 While this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature, I do have some critical comments to make. Firstly, it is apparent that the author's own holocaust experiences (or more specifically, those of his family) have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented. Secondly, there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get, in my opinion, a few pieces of interesting material. Finally, the underlying theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened, or would not have been so sever, is (again in my opinion) flawed. As the book shows, IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews, it would not have been impossible without IBM.  Having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading 
 First of all, this is not country, it's a contrived attempt for second rate southern rock and boogie. And of course anybody that name checks Tom Petty or Aerosmith or ZZ Top or Hank Jr sure isn't playing country.  And of course knowing Anderson's songwriting, drinking Jack Daniels is as country as Budweiser.  Of course it helps when you're endorsed by JD. But then again Keith Anderson knew that he couldn't make it on rock radio with this,so he went country and he wants you to think he's country and a little bit of rock and roll.  And if thats the case then Keith Urban is Tom Petty and Kenny Chesney is Hank Jr, and Lonestar is Aerosmith.  Also beware that this is copy protect.  Hoohaw to your yeehaw country poser 
 This is by far the worst book I have ever read.  It is dull, boring, and you don't even have a clue as to what is going on until about the 20th chapter (and it only has 22 chapters) 
 This is my first Nick Hornby read and I was very tempted to make it my last.  I had a really hard time getting through it.  I usually read a book straight through in 2-3 days and can't wait to read them at any free moment.  But, I had to force myself to get through this one.  The book didn't flow very well and seemed to skip all over the place.    Seeing negative reviews from people who have read his other books has helped me decide to give Hornby another chance.    I wouldn't recommend this book 
 First, despite what the socialist apologists tell you, Walter Rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some co-conspirators out of prison.  Only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding walkie-talkies.  Come on.  It exploded in his lap for goodness sake.  Mark Hoffman tried that defense and it didn't get him anywhere either.  Second, championing the cause of the poor, which Rodney admittedly did, is not the same as actually helping them, or even more important for HEUA, being a perceptive scholar.  Rodney's book is riddled with distortions, fallacies and unsubstantiated premises.  One glaring example.  Rodney pays practically zero attention to Mediterranean Africa.  For him, only sub-Saharan Africa is the "real" Africa.  Why?  Because his natural ethnic affinity for the area.  Nothing wrong with that, but then again, you shouldn't title your book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" but rather "How Europe Underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa." Rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman, a straw man, or almost anything other than the truth: Africa's problems arise from its residents, not from outside forces.  And spouting Marxist dogma isn't going to change that fact.  It was known 25 years ago; it's known a fortiori now 
 Billed as a book written by a Californian who moves to Provence, this book is actually written by a French woman who, after spending some time in Beverly Hills, moves back to France into a home that has been "modernized" for her.  If you're more interested in boring acounts of how to impress your neighbors than you are in the joy of living life in a beautiful part of the world, then by all means - buy this book.  My girlfriend and I were thoroughly disappointed, and returned this pretensious monstrosity for a full refund.  For a more substantial and joyful read, try "A Year in Provence" by Peter Mayle, the book that almost certainly inspired Lenard's shallow and uninspired effort 
 This a dreadful example of what Jayne was reduced to play in to feed her children and compensate for the lack of earnings of her deadbeat-husbands/lovers. The only reason to watch it would be because Mamie Van Doren was also in it.But be aware (and i read that in a biography about Jayne) that in their contracts was specified that they would NOT appear together in ANY scene whatsoever.So you see them SEPARATELY in different scenes.Also be aware that if you blink,you will not see either of the 2 blonde beauties. Conclusion:Get this film for a member of your family who is nostalgic for the ways of the ''Ol' South',or someone with a white hood showing his eyes onl 
 I'm a huge fan of Ted Dekkar, but lately I've noticed that his books have been lacking. Showdown was a wonderful read, and I was completely engrossed in it, thinking I would feel the same about SAINT I bought it. I think the most dissapointing about this book was that it was actually a sequel to Showdown, yet you don't know it till halfway through. I found this completely rediculous, and even though the story was somewhat interesting at times, it never really seemed to go anywhere...and never really ended either. There is never any true complete ending, and it leaves you feeling like you read a whole bunch of words instead of an actual story 
 During Pearl Jam's riot act tour in 2003, Sleater Kinney was  the opening band.I got tickets for the show. In preperation  for the concert, I picked up a few kinney albums. First this one. For one I had heard songs at the college station I worked and since one member Janet weiss was in Quasi( a great band) I thought it couldn't be all bad. At  first listening to the albums it was alright. Then it got  annoying. Those high pitched screams from the singer began to be fingernails on a chalkboard. Repetitive, middle of the road punk. Then came the concert. Once Sleater hit the stage, everyone and I mean everyone around me had no clue who they were. They were all asking me, who's this? I had to tell them all. No one was digging the concert. Minamal applause. No dancing or cheering, nothing. The songs that night didn't flow. The usual screaming was,as always, ear screeching and annoying. A few people mis-took the bassist for a man, but we were in the nose-bleed seats. Once sleater-kinney did their  last song and walked off stage the audience clapped with much enthusiasim, cause they knew they were finally done

 The movies were pretty good.  These DVDs appeared to offer closed captioning but I could not get that feature "on."  Therefore, the person I bought them for could not enjoy them.  
  Downloaded the new McAfee software.  My computer is now slowed over 90% of the speed of a snail- both with AOL and Internet Explorer.  McAfee customer service is of no value whatever.  McAfee FAQ  describes a very dangerous fix which involves editing the registry file but even those instructions don't seem to work as described.     What a mistake 
 I had to say that I, too, thought this was the worst book I have ever read--hands down.  I have a master's degree in comparitive literature, and other than Moll Flanders and Fanny Hill, I have never read a...what did the other reviewer call them "bodice-rippers"?--so it's not a case of lack of taste.  The author of this book is self-indulgent, pompous, "in the know, and I'm never going to let you forget it!"--the whole thing is like listening to a half muttered conversation that after time you realize that you are never going to be let into.  I did plow through to the end, but only as a test of my endurance.  And I cheered at the end--but only because the damned thing was done 
 Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book.  It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the "design" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying 
 I'm a huge Dylan fan---own everything he ever released.  In my humble opinion, this is Bob's worst.  Just a really bad CD.  'Nuff said 
 before i began writing this review, i surfed the internet looking for reviews from other readers.  90% of the reviews i read began or ended similarly: i am a ____teen year old girl.  having only gotten through 150 pages of this book before calling it quits, i wasn't surprised to learn that so many young women gravitated towards this book. after all, the novel's protagonist is just such a teenage girl.  however, this fact is more than a little bit troubling because astrid is not someone you'd want your daughter/sister/niece/cousin/etc to identify with. it's also troubling because when so many people, both younger and older, hail 'white oleander' as some sort of literary masterpiece, even going so far as to compare it to nabakov's 'lolita.' this is a horrifying book, not necessarily for the story's content (which is equally horrifying), but for it's plot, execution, characterization, and particularly its ham-fisted writing.  to be sure, this is a book written for the oprah generation and reflects the 'oprah-fication' of literature. the novel's problems are so many, that i simply won't have time to address them all.  however, i will address some of them:   1) astrid.  the novel's protagonist, a fourteen year old girl, is a thoroughly contradictory character.  some people have written that astrid is not your 'average' teenage girl and that she is 'gifted.'  if she were such a girl, i would expect much more of her.  that's the least of the problems, however.  i'm not a psychologist nor have i ever been shot, but i suspect any fourteen year old girl who's mother was sent to prison for murder, offered herself sexually to a man three times her age, is shot by her first foster mother, performs oral sex on a boy in exchange for 1/2 bag of marijuana would be severly emotionally disturbed and troubled.  astrid, however, seems to care less that she herself was nearly murdered, instead she focuses on and longs her sexual encounters with ray. remember, this is a fourteen year old girl.  any credibility astrid has a narrator is blown early on because no one who's gone through her experiences would be in as good as shape as she is. it also discredits her as a character, and with a discredited character, the novel doesn't stand a chance. think about a fourteen year old girl you know. now imagine her beaten, shot, mother in prison for murder, sexually loose (some may argue ray took advantage of her, but remember, astrid was the one who approached ray and when he said no, astrid was the one who dropped her clothes), and yearning for a lover three times her age. it simply wouldn't happen.    2) unfortunately, the plot fitch drops astrid is pretty much by the numbers.  i have trouble with any novel where the plot is advanced by a series of tragedies or dire circumstances.  more often than not, it's a gimmick (or crutch) inexperienced writers rely on when realistic ideas for authentic plots run thin ('the kite runner' suffered similar fate).  read joan didion or toni morrison (or steinbeck) and how see how they use tragedy--it's real, honest, and most importanly believable.  most of the 'white oleander's' is simply too unrealistic.  3)  the prose is borderline comical.  i was awe-struck to read how many people have praised fitch's prose.  fitch's use of similie is so overdone and forced that it slows the narrative down to a cumbersome pace.  similes should be used judiciously and flow naturally. fitch, on the other hand, find it's necessary to inject as many as four or five similies in just about every paragraph, and most of them just ring false and forced.  the 'white' metaphor is also an unfortunate victim.  count the number of times fitch uses 'white' to describe astrid, ingrid, clothes, food, dishes, the sky, etc, etc, etc.  she beats the 'white' metaphor into holy submission and never really allows the reader to discover for him or herself underlying metaphors.  the majority of the book is over-described, and so many of the descriptions are flowery and self-indulgent, as if fitch is trying to prove to her readers that she's a capable and talented writer.  the sex scenes, in particular, are dreadful.  i don't want to read how a fourteen year old remembers every graphic detail of performing oral sex on a middle-aged man.  it's too much. way too much.  a 14 year old girl who's performed oral sex on a man is not going to long for it again. i can tell you that.  furthermore: at one point astrid sees a shiny convertible, compares it to a man,  and imagines herself climaxing while laying on its hood; during her encounter with ray, she describes the act as riding a horse through the surf.  and those are just the sex scenes.  also, fitch refers to one man's hair as 'balding.'  hair, of course, can't bald.  scalps can bald.  hair cannot bald.  these comparisons seem better fit for 3.99 romance novels at the supermarket checkout.  fitch also seems intent on stringing together a bunch of pretty words in hopes of making pretty sentences.  unfortunately, this does not work.  pretty words don't necessarily make pretty sentences the same way pretty notes don't necessarily make pretty songs.  fitch's prose works much the same way thomas kincaide's 'art' works -- it's looks pretty, but there's really no substance to it.  it's also much like 'legends of the fall' -- sure it looks great, but all you get when you strip the prettiness away, you end up with little more than a soap opera.  she would do well to focus more on advancing plot than affecting a poetic or lyrical voice.  4) the characters and uniformly cliched and poorly drawn.  astrid's mother is the self-absorbed, feminist poet.  her first foster mother is a bible-thumping floozy; her stepmother's boyfriend is the object of astrid's desires, even though he's more then three times her age; the second stepmother is demanding and her husband is quiet and reserved; and of course we have the 'hooker with a heart of gold' who takes astrid under her wing.   in fact, the professional prostitute is the only emotionally stable and 'nice' character in the entire 150 pages that i read.   what's fitch trying to say?  maybe something, maybe nothing.  but fitch's character's seem born straight out of some pseudo-intellectual writer's workshop.  any editor worth his or her salt should've have caught and corrected these flaws.  the fact that the editor(s) didn't, while i'd like to think it was out of sheer laziness, is  proof that american literature as a whole is in serious decline and that unrealistic plots and characters = big dollars.  and as i mentioned earlier, the fact that so many people hail this book as high literature signals trouble for the future of the american letters.  i know most people will probably vote this 'unhelpful' simply because i disagree on the book's merits.  that's fine. i, for one, strongly object to this novel on the whole.  i'm sure that as most of the teenage girls grow up and mature, they'll see 'white oleander' for what is is: an immature, adolescent novel masquerading as high literature. and i sincerely hope that no more young women identify with astrid in anyway.  that's the real tragedy 
 Theodore Dreiser has never been one of my favorite writers, and his novel AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY, although rooted in fact, always felt too pat and mechanical, but at least the original never stacked the deck as badly as this lumbering, self-important film version does.  The heartbreak of the original is that the factory girl that the main character kills in an attempt to achieve his social ambitions is at least as charming, perhaps more so, than the rich girl he covets as his stepping stone to The Good Life.  And in Joseph von Sternberg's early 30's film of the book, that girl was played by the radiant Sylvia Sydney.  The theorem of the story, of course, is that having to be married to her while only making a factory worker's salary would be such a grind and a misery that the pair would be miserable and hate one another in very short order.  Well, maybe the greedy, ambitious quisling at the center of Dreiser's novel, but most men with any common sense would rather spend life in a cold-water walk-up with Sylvia Sydney than life in a mansion with any real-life heiress . . .  And the same would probably be true if Shelley Winters were allowed to be her actual, ebulliant self in the same role.  But George Stevens, who directed this version, wanted a shrill, drab harpie who would have driven men away even if she had just inherited several million dollars.  The rich girl, on the other hand, is played by Elizabeth Taylor at her loveliest and most luminous.  This is not a fair fight.  And the film cheats in other ways--the protagonist is now played by Montgomery Clift at the height of his soulful handsomeness, and although he could have played his character as cold, weak, and self-absorbed (if you doubt this, check out his performance as Morris Townsend in THE HEIRESS, where he brings the chill of Henry James' novel WASHINGTON SQUARE to the tidied-up proceedings), Stevens and his screenwriters, Michael Wilson and Harry Brown, were apparently having none of this--George Eastman is now a doomed romantic hero, and so his murder of Winters becomes an accident, even though he did mean to kill her but chickened out on it.  And although he and Taylor did achieve a marvellous sort of rapport at times (William Mellor's soft-focus photography didn't hurt), it makes what should be a much more ambiguous relationship into the stuff of adolescent daydreams.  And whatever the faults of the original material, it was much more of a nightmare . .  
 This book is a question and answer EFT guide for dummies.  There is a page that gives the location of the tapping points on the human body.  The points are abbreviated with symbols, i.e., EB for Beginning of Eyebrow, or UA for Under the Arm, SE for Side of the Eyebrow, Th for Thumb, so as to be able to identify the approximate vicinity of the acupuncture point.   However different "symptoms" are relieved by tapping different points (as in acupuncture). One is supposed to try to find the symptom he is experiencing and then is directed to tap on the appropriate acupuncture point, all the while thinking of the symptom to be alleviated and stating affirmations. Each symptom has a different set of points on which to tap and by the time one finds a symptom and then goes back to pages 6 and 7 to identify abbreviation symbols and check the chart to see to what parts of the body the symbols refer, one could easily get a stress attack.  Meanwhile, there is no index directing one to the exact pages for his symptom. This is not what I was looking for.   I want an EFT book with an index that directs me to a page and then gives me the acupuncture points to be tapped, while assuming a certain peaceful state of mind. I want the book to be very specific about the location of the points, also the pressure which should be exerted in the tapping. I do think that this system has some merit because it does utilize the acupuncture points of electrical stimulation and would love to try it.  This book is more of a psychology book than a direction guide to using the EFT power points.  Then there is the question and answer format that is no help whatsoever.  More time is spent trying to locate the topic in which you are interested, than in getting actual answers.  You must read through dozens and dozens of questions to find your topics of interest and then, maybe your concern won't be addressed after all.    I do hope that someone in the field publishes a user-friendly EFT/Acupuncture Tapping Point Manual that will be easy to use and contain an INDEX, please.  I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 because it does contain valid psychology concepts in the questions and answers.  However as a valid EFT Manual, I'd give it a 1 because you do at least get the chart on pages 6 and 7 identifying the acupuncture points 
 Sorry, this is one of the worst books I've ever read. It is overwritten and makes no worthwhile point. It is both incoherent and disjointed, and incorporates many stray Portuguese words no one would want to know.This is a fine example of the waste that often pervades academic presses 
 very shallow interpretation even for beginners, in addition accompanied by helplessly boring photographs. avoid 
 This book is awful.  It is full of speculations and just bad science.  I am going to quote one egregious example.  The comments in brackets [ ] are mine:  "Like the brain, the human eye also evolved opposite [really!] but complementary functions.  Each human eye is a perfect mirror image of the other; yet within the each retina there resides two functionally different types of cells.  With elegant symmetry, the contrasting functions of the rods and cones correspond to the division of tasks between the right and left brain [that is quite a comparison]. "Rods named for their cylindrical shape, are extremely light sensitive.   Distributed evenly throught the periphery of each retina, they see in dim light and appreciate [the rods have feelings??] the totality of the visual field, seeing images as gestalts.  Rods share with the right brain the ability to perceive [the rods can think??] reality all-at-once [as opposed to what, a little bit at a time?]. Cones, in contrast congregate densely in a small spot in the central part of the retina...Cones have two attributes.  They appreciate [there he goes again] color and intensify clarity [whatever that means]. Concentrating on one aspect of reality at a time, [huh?] cones view the visual field as if through a tunnel. [Actually cones and rods sense light together, at the same time, and your brain integrates and intreprets all that information into a perceived image.  But the most fantastic statement is the last sentance of this quote:]  Like rods, cones report to both hemispheres, but the left is metaphorically best suited to process their input.  [That is such an absurd statement that Shlain gives a footnote, right on the same page, contradicting his non sequitor.]"  And so it goes on for page after page of drivel, I finally gave up after 6 chapters.  A lot of reviewers find this book to be thought provoking.  I think it is a sad state that our appreciation of science is so dim that people can actually find this nonsense to be of interest 
 Hello to all those who have read this book.  After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something.  WHy are you so set against God and Christianity?  One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity.  Christianity is not some weird religion,  it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much.  Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.  Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him.  Thank you 
 I really enjoyed the movie.  The story background is the Fred Harvey restaurants and concessions at train stations.  My father worked for Fred Harvey at the Chicago and Cleveland facilities.  Regarding the movie and Judy Garland - The movie is great and Judy was one of my favorite entertainers.  Lane Hanse 
 I feel that this book is inadequte for students and professionals alike. It does not explain well how systems act in real life situations, like most academia book 
 While this book provides a lot of technical information it was written over seven years ago.  The information provided is practically ancient in the high tech and ever changing world of IVF.  The author is very dry, clinical and frankly quite negative about the chances of success.  Again, this is due to the age of the book.  IVF success rates have increased dramatically since this book was published.  A much better, positive, timely and accurate book is The Couples Guide to IVF.  It was written in this century and it much more helpful, upbeat and informative.  
 I guess I have to be the odd woman out this time.  I saw nothing likeable about either character, finding both one-dimensional and uninteresting.  Every horry old Harlequinism is here:  the unredeemably bad mother, the misunderstood heroine, the fabulously wealthy alpha-alpha-alpha hero, the exotic locale, the bad dialogue.  I know the author wanted to show the hero's growth from chauvinist to sensitive good guy and the heroine's spine by running away from a bad situation until the hero changed.  But the author couldn't sell me on either.  I bought this book on the strength of other books by Lucy Monroe.  I know LM is capable of much better storytelling than this formulaic, uninspired nonsense 
 What's worse than a guide that doesn't know his way?  A guide that leads you far up the wrong path.  Imagine buying a map where the streets and roads led you into all the wrong places.  According to the ad copy:  "...avoid tourist traps.  Frommer's Portable Guides help you make the right travel choices...Outspoken opinions on top attractions - what's worth your time and what's not...The best hotels and restaurants in every price range, with candid reviews...The expert guidance you need to take charge and travel with confidence."  The haughty tone of this particular edition would make you think the author(s) were steeped in expert knowledge about the history and traditions of the long-standing established hotels and attractions in the region.  And this illusion is effective until you arrive at more than one location expecting to find a rural paradise only to discover that it has become a gated community/housing development.  So what do the authors actually know other than what they seem to have compiled from the hotel brochure you find at McDonald's?  Not a whole heck of a lot.  For several of the hotels reviewed in this "guide", the reviews were obviously at least two years out of date and completely unrepresentative, to the extent that there was an impression that the guide was protecting the interests of the establishment being described, or should I say, advertised.  So, am I actually paying for a compendium of advertising?    Any guide can draw a fine line between objective "candid review", favoritism and deceptive promotion.  Many aspects of this guide fall into the last category.  Someone's not doing their research, which is why a reader may actually pay for a book, or perhaps, someone is getting some money under the table.  This guide is inaccurate and deceptive.  Check their reviews at their Frommer's site on the Internet.  Then check what's actually going on at sites like Tripadvisor or other travel forums.  In this aspect, print is dead 
 "The Wild" is under the "Walt Disney Pictures" banner, and even rated G, so I expected it to be a picture for the whole family, of which the studio is proud. I hoped it would put me in the Disney mood prior to our family trip to Walt Disney World.  Disappointed am I. It's mediocre and has just about nothing in common with the Walt Disney legacy. To be sure, it is not unusually offensive (the way the usually superb Ron Howard offended me with his witless and crude destruction of "Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas"). It is just irritating and amateurish in its writing and direction. For those of you who know something about animation, has no one informed the director "Spaz" (his self-chosen moniker) or any of the animators the concept of the "hold"? A "hold" in animation is when the movement stops for a moment to emphasize an expression or an attitude or a gesture. It is priceless when used well (and gives the animator a few frames worth of a break, besides). Perhaps the all time masters of the hold in animation are Chuck Jones (think of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner), Tex Avery, and Bob Clampett during the golden age of Warner Brothers cartoons.  "The Wild" has a total of zero holds. Everyone and everything is moving twenty-four times every second from movie's beginning to end. Who can watch that? My eyes just couldn't take it. The attitudes and gestures were all there. They were just there ten times more often than any human mind could process.  But that could be forgiven if the story was clever, conveyed a meaningful theme and was told with clarity, drama, and humor.  Instead of clarity, every sentence of dialogue was written to sound ironic or sarcastic or "funny" or "witty," never actually achieving real humor or wit. It's hard to know what any character really wants if they never express themselves clearly and simply. (I suppose once in a while they did, but that was the exception.) There is no attempt to make the squirrel's romantic crush remotely believable, and the father-son theme is trite as can be. Finally, there is so much slapstick violence (characters get hurt a lot) that I almost question the G rating. It's a valid rating but the film is definitely too full of scares (like the far superior "The Incredibles") for anyone under age 7. (This is not new in the Disney tradition, as "Snow White", "Bambi", "Sleeping Beauty" and maybe "Peter Pan" are also too intense for the very young).  There is no less artistry required to make a kid's comedy animation than any adult movie. In fact, more awareness of one's all-ages audience is required to make it entertaining and meaningful rather than irritating, boring or traumatizing. The theme of "The Wild", trite as it is, has potential value but it's ineffectively communicated.  I think "Spaz" and his crew believed they had a film so full of roll-on-the-floor belly-laughs it would excuse the flimsiness of the story. Unfortunately they were mistaken. This was not a Pixar movie if you didn't figure that out yet. The good news is, Pixar is back in business with Disney and we can look forward to their consistently superior material, which has already started with "Cars" 
 Though I'm coming to a review of The Search a year too late, I can explain why. I bought the book on its release, very excited to read some good journalism about the hottest business topic of the day. I was sure that Battelle, who had been chronically his progress on the book on his own blog, would deliver. Halfway through the book (in a matter of three days - a possible sign pointing to its lack of depth) I'm realizing that this is not the case.   Thus far, I have two major gripes with the book. The first is the writing itself.  The book is written in informal magazine style, in keeping with his roots as a "cutting edge" technology writer (having worked for Wired and Business 2.0, magazines that try desperately to be "too cool for the room").   This would be fine enough, except that Battelle has a habit of jumping around from year to year, talking about decisions made by players in Google's history before he actually introduces them. He never fully explains why it was important for Sergey Brin and Larry Page - Google's founders - to resign their chairman and CEO posts, nor does he tell the reader what their new titles are. Battelle also has a habit of reintroducing people several times, a practice which at times seems a cheap way to up his page count. His writing style thoroughly muddles however much thoughtfulness there was to his project. I considered keeping a tally of how many times he used "well" as an interjection, but lost interested after I ran out of fingers.   On page 150 he discusses a lack of managerial prowess on the part of Brin, Page and new CEO Eric Schmidt. According to Battelle, one of Google's investors, John Doerr, insisted that Intuit founder Bill Campbell come on as a leadership coach. Battelle uses an anecdote from journalist John Heilemann's GQ article on Google, which quotes Doerr as saying, "I don't know where the company would be without him." However, Battelle doesn't include any of his own reporting on what Campbell actually did. Neglecting to explain right away what this `miraculous' shift was is, in my own journalistic view, irresponsible. Not to mention that he doesn't include the actual title of Heilemann's article in either the main book or the citations.   Later in the book on page 172, he tries to play the role of not only a technology writer, and search historian, but also media theorist and critic, waxing about how Google ought to be considered a media company - not just a technology company.  In the book's final chapter, Battelle introduces the idea of having several different kinds of information contribute to "perfect search," including every tech writer and journalist's favorite idea, the blog. He bulldozes through a description of the blog and later posits that we have reached the critical mass point, "but we don't know it yet." I suspect that Battelle means that he's savvier than users and other writers and he knows something we don't, but he doesn't explain why he thinks we've reached the tipping point, nor what that means in the overall discussion of what the blog can do.   Though Battelle tries to play his book as a "history of search," it is nowhere near as comprehensive as such a book must be. It is a book that sings the praises of Google, nothing more. However, that the book is a history of Google is fine. The company certainly is interesting and large enough to warrant an historical account and Battelle ought to be forthcoming with his intent. The short discussions he does include of the company's search engine precursors such as Lycos and Alta-Vista need considerable expansion and deserve to be considered as more than also-rans, if he really wants to be considered the historian of search and not just Google's unofficial corporate historian.  
 I bought the set thinking that it was similar to the newer edition of the Nurser, which I already had but needed more bottles for convenience.  I was very disappointed.  The lids leaked and the nipple rings leaked and the bottle plastic seemed cheap.  I used it for about a week and then got rid of it 
 Advertisement for this book is misleading. I thought it was the actual book, however its merely a workbook full of vocabulary. Not helpful at all!!! Save your money, you will still need the real book anyway! 
 I tried the recipes for My Grandmother's Chicken Soup, Dill-crusted Artic Char with Pinot Noir Sauce, and Corn Mashed Potatoes.   All had major flaws in them: The chicken soup not only did not match the picture (which shows hunks of chicken, lemon grass, fresh thyme, and what look like tomatoes, none of which appear in the recipe) and gave no directions for a major ingredient (garam masala).  The finished product was bland (I included the garam masala in the roasting step), but usable.  The artic char was completely overwhelmed by the sauce, although the seared skin and potato layer (way to much dill, though) was a good idea.  Finally, the potato dish turned into soup when I added even less than the specified half of the cooking liquid; I remedied this by cooking the mixture (not called for in the recipe) which, after all, did contain two raw egg yolks at that point, until it thickened up to a reasonable consistency.  The product was quite good, and the corn is a nice addition to this simple accompaniment.  In summary, the ideas in this cookbook are intriguing, and I will continue to experiment with them, but a lot more kitchen testing of the printed recipes was needed before releasing this beautiful, but expensive and inaccurate cookbook.        
 After having read the positive reviews,  I was rather disappointed that this book fell flat of my expectations.  While the concept is an appealing way to relate the changes in higher education, the book lacked the wit it  promised to deliver. Often, the anecdotes seemed too simplistic and  one-sided; the writing often seemed to lack subtlety and craftsmanship need  to enhance the content. My one consolation: I did not buy this in hardback 
 I hate this book because Karen is much to young for love! I also think Ricky is to good for Karen.  Ricky is funny, sweet and charming, while Karen thinks she is perfect and bullies her freinds.  Speaking of Karens friends, I also think Hannah and Nancy are much to good for Karen, because  they are both so nice and all and Karen is a little Devil 
 This more I think about this book, the more thought provoking it becomes.  First, I find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that's widely known (practically a cliche), add nothing of substance to it, and actually write a book about it.  Second, I find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the Golden Rule applicable to business.  Third, and perhaps the most amazing of all, is the fact that I actually spent my own hard earned money on this book.  What amazing insights did I think would be uncovered?  I'll save you $9.72 (+s/h) and the 45 minutes it'll take you to read this.  Here goes... Unless you were raised by wolves, it's pretty likely you've heard of the Golden Rule.  Ok, now think about how this rule can be applied to all of your business dealings.  That's it - you got it!    Whew!  Now that you have an extra $9.72 in your pocket and 45 minutes of free time, go practice that Golden Rule by treating your kids/grandkids/neighbors to some ice cream 
 This could just very well be the worse novel in existance. There is no clear beginning, middle or end, but rather the story feels bland and the character developement is vague in almost every aspect. The narrator comes out of the book as selfish and a whinner and at times she seemed unsure of her sexuality. Nothing in the story is explained well enough to actually call this a story. It's as if a person grouped a bunch of words together in hopes that something good would come of it, but sadly the only thing good about this novel was after I set it down, because I wouldn't have to bear looking at it any longer. 
 Benjamin has written a highly valuable book here. My concern is with Verso's treatment of it. The binding is horrible -- my edition literally fell apart on the first read. There are no annotations which, in a book as wide-ranging and dense as this, is a gross oversight. In short, a horrible edition of a great book. Find another version. 
 I was looking forward to reading this book on what I thought would be a keen insider's look at the Cuban missile crisis, and was somewhat disappointed.  I realize that RFK was not able to complete the text, and perhaps that is reflected in it's length (100 pages of narrative).  A large part of the printed material, about 1/3, is made up of supporting documents.  I had hoped for more detail about the minute-to-minute events of those 13 days.  The strength of the book is its undeniably interesting topic and author.  There was insight to the crisis that I had not previously known, and reading it here was interesting and informative.  For a mid-1900's buff, this might be one piece of a collection and its uniqueness may prove worthwhile.  This is the first book I read on the Cuban missile crisis, and I am left wanting a lot more 
 New editions of this book continue being published to have teachers require "the new edition" from students. This way the publisher and the compilers keep on plundering unashamedly the parents' pockets. Interestingly, to compile comes from the latin "compilare", which means to plunder. Compilation as it is, plus "obvious" literary theory, this book should cost no more than its weight in paper plus a few dollars. The obvious recommendation to the student is: when completed the course sell this "brick" before a new edition appears, and buy and read the full versions of the classics (Sophocles, Shakespeare, Lord Tennyson, Ibsen, Chekhov, Faulkner, Melville, Browning, J. Keats, Donne, Wordsworth, W. B. Yeats, ...); disregard all the remaining mediocre authors this book includes. Regarding Sophocles, Oedipux Rex, the translation the compilers have chosen is by Duddley Fitts and Robert Fitzgerald. Fitts was playwriter, and Fitzgerald, academic as he was and popularly known for his translations of The Iliad and The Odyssey, was never a "translator" but a "paraphraser". Read the translations by Lattimore for a "taste" of the originals, instead. Regarding "obvious" literary theory" a few sentences choosen at random from the 9th edition will suffice: Drama "normally presents its action (a) through actors, (b) on stage, and (c) before and audience" (pp.1028).  "The sharpness and vividness of any image will ordinarily depend on how specific it is and on the poet's use of effective detail" (pp. 702).  "Talented authors achieve compression by exercising a careful selectivity" (pp. 274).  
 In the first 7 books, there was the same reader, now, with the mark, there is a new reader,  which is always a pain in the butt.  This new author also tried to imitate the accents of each person.  Not fun to listen to.  Add to this my opinion these books are nothing but poorly constructed religious porn 
 Yes there are neat pictures in this book and loads of mathematica code. But that's it: no attempt is made to educate the reader: no list of important graphics programming paradigms, general strategies, etc. This book fails dramatically to meet the high standard set by the marvelous "mathematica book".  The many bugs and common work-arounds of the mathematica graphics system are not discussed at all. I would have wished a chapter about what is NOT possible with mathematica - such a chapter would have saved me a lot of time wasted in searching.  If you really want to do graphics programming, forget about this book and check the excellent mathematica usegroup instead 
 Gardner's book is full of banal and often incorrect observations. It's hard to believe he has received over 20 honorary degrees from universities around the world if his ideas are this unoriginal. He chooses the staggeringly bad examples of Margaret Thatcher, George Bush and BP CEO John Browne as people who have successfully changed minds. He doesn't mention that Thatcher and Bush antagonized large sections of their countries' populations, completely failing to change their minds, in fact hardening their positions of opposition; in large part due to these leaders' own refusal to ever change their minds or consider alternative policies. Gardner lavishes praise on Bush for switching from isolationism to an interventionist foreign policy after 9/11, without any mention of the PNAC team that had already planned to invade Iraq even before 9/11.   As for John Browne, his claim to have repositioned BP as an environmentally and socially concerned company has been discredited in the past year with the explosion at a Texas refinery and the oil spill on the North Slope that led to the admission that BP hadn't done any of the anti-corrosion work it was supposed to do on its pipelines.   Another poor example is Lawrence Summers of Harvard. For some reason Gardner doesn't mention the biggest controversy Summers was involved with, when he said that women could never be as good at science as men. Gardner's use of case studies from academia is another bad choice because most readers won't have heard of these professors and won't care much about their internal disputes. It's a shame Gardner didn't tackle any real-life problems, such as how to change the minds of Creationists.   Gardner insists on using "she" and "her" instead of "he" and "his" as the neutral pronoun for political correctness, and another irritating habit he has is to invent jargon that will obviously never catch on, such as "wetware" and "dryware" for the internal workings of the brain and "GoodWork" for being ethical at work, yet another painfully banal concept.   In one section Gardner describes how a psychologist uses a patient's dream to understand how the patient sees himself (or should I say herself even if he was male?) in relation to others, which sounds to me like total cod psychology, but that's just my own reaction to dream interpretations.   Regarding computers, Gardner believes that people are starting to prefer interaction with computers over interaction with other people. This again is utterly mistaken and it's clear that Gardner has next to no experience with the internet. Thanks to the internet there has been an explosion in human interaction and far more people talk with other people than with computers. Gardner says people can get emotional solace from interaction with computers that are programmed to communicate and cites a book written in 1995, but gives no further justification of this claim.   Anyone writing about changing minds ought to have a full understanding of how people use the internet and communicate on all kinds of levels that weren't possible before this technology existed, for example role-playing or participating in a political discussion forum, as well as absorbing surreptitious marketing on the internet.   Gardner's specific advice on how to change minds consists of using a variety of words that all begin with "re" for convenience, eg resonance and resistance. I had hoped to learn how to communicate my ideas better from this book, but all I learnt was that it was a bad book. 
 It seems as though the smooth jazz artist are trying to attract the r & b listener.  The cd was done in poor taste and the songs lack creativity as well originality.  Too many vocals.  I would rather here him play his wonderful guitar.  I love Norman Brown but it seems as though he just through this together 
 Amanda Pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity, but otherwise this film did nothing for me. A bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests? I can't even relate. And they're trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness? Yeah right! See it if you're a big fan of fart jokes, or whatever.. 
 John Smiley's book is supposed to be an introductory level book for novice level programmers. At the time it was written, I'm sure it was. However, the book is written around Access 97 and a lot has changed since then. The code simply will not work without patches, work arounds and lots of digging. It takes far more than a novice programmer to figure this one out. It defeats the purpose. If you don't like frustration, find a more recent book. 
 An extremely frustrating book to read due to the author stretching what should be one or two chapters into a full book by repeating the same points over and over and over.  After suffering through to the end, not one new or interesting idea that you would not have not already envountered by reading the business/investing section of a decent newspaper or The Economist.  Honestly, one of the worst books, financial or otherwise, I ever read in my life 
 Without resorting to unintelligent baseless claims and conjectures like Mr. Harvey has done, the facts of the book as presented do not reflect what Gotama taught. If Mr. Harvey, in his book, had presented his book as "the view of X school of tibetan Vajrayana", that would suffice, however the book itself presupposes to be "what Gotama taught", which is utterly without scriptural representation.     Anatta in sutra is synonymous and interchangeable with the terms dukkha (suffering) and anicca (impermanent), and all three terms are often used in triplet in making a blanket statement as regards any and all phenomena. "All these aggregates are anicca, dukkha, and anatta."        Anatta refers only to the absence of the permanent soul as pertains any one of the psycho-physical (namo-rupa) attributes, or Khandhas (skandhas, aggregates). Anatta/Anatman in the earliest Buddhist texts, the Nikayas, is an adjective, (A is anatta, B is anatta, C is anatta). The commonly held belief to wit that: "Anatta means no-soul, therefore Buddhism taught that there was no soul" is a concept, which cannot be found or doctrinally substantiated by means of the Nikayas, the sutras, of Buddhism.        It is of course true that the Buddha denied the existence of the mere empirical "self" in the very meaning of "my-self" (this person so-and-so, namo-rupa, an-atta), one might say in accordance with the command `denegat seipsum, [Mark VII.34]; but this is not what modern writers mean to say, or are understood by their readers to say; what they mean to say is that the Buddha denied the immortal (amata), the unborn (ajata) and Supreme-Self (mahatta') of the Upanishads. And that is palpably false, for he frequently speaks of this Self, or Spirit (mahapurisha), and nowhere more clearly than in the too often repeated formula 'na me so atta', "This/these are not my Soul" (na me so atta'= anatta/anatman), excluding body (rupa) and the components of empirical consciousness (vinnana/ nama), a statement to which the words of Sankhara are peculiarly apposite, "Whenever we deny something unreal, is it in reference to something real"[Br. Sutra III.2.22]. It was not for the Buddha but for the nihilist (natthika) to deny the Soul.       In fact the phrase "Doctrine of anatta", or "Anatmavada" is a concept utterly foreign to Buddhist Sutra, existing in only non-doctrinal Theravada and Madhyamika commentaries. As the saying goes, a "lie repeated often enough over time becomes the truth". Those interested parties to Buddhism incapable of pouring through endless piles of Buddhist doctrine have defacto accepted the notion of a "Doctrine of anatta" as key to Buddhism itself, when in fact there exists not one citation of this concept in either the Digha, Majjhima, Samyutta, Anguttara, or Khuddaka Nikayas. Unless evoking a fallacy, we must stick strictly to sutra as reference, wherein the usage of anatta never falls outside of the parameter of merely denying Self or Soul to the profane and transitory phenomena of temporal and samsaric life which is "subject to arising and passing", and which is most certain not (AN) our Soul (ATTA). Certainly the most simple philosophical logic would lead anyone to conclude that no part of this frail body is "my Self, is That which I am", is "not my Soul", of which Gotama the Buddha was wholeheartedly in agreement that no part of it was the Soul, i.e. was in fact anatta.       The perfect contextual usage of anatta is: "Whatever form, feelings, perceptions, experiences, or consciousness there is (the five aggregates), these he sees to be without permanence, as suffering, as ill, as a plague, a boil, a sting, a pain, an affliction, as foreign, as otherness, as empty (suññato), as Selfless (anattato). So he turns his mind away from these and gathers his mind/will within the realm of Immortality (amataya dhatuya). This is tranquility; this is that which is most excellent!" [MN 1.436]       The term anatman is found not only in Buddhist sutras, but also in the Upanishads and lavishly so in the writings of Samkara, the founder of Advaita Vedanta. Anatman is a common via negativa (neti neti, not this, not that) teaching method common to Vedanta, Neoplatonism, early Christian mystics, and others, wherein nothing affirmative can be said of what is "beyond speculation, beyond words, and concepts" thereby eliminating all positive characteristics that might be thought to apply to the Soul, or be attributed to it; to wit that the Subjective ontological Self-Nature (svabhava) can never be known objectively, but only thru "the denial of all things which it (the Soul) is not"- Meister Eckhart. This doctrine is also called by the Greeks Apophasis.  ----Mr. Harveys book is, unfortunately, little more than a secular pseudo-intellectual attempt to "take Christ out of Christianity", or in this case to take the "only refuge (the Soul/Atman), out of Buddhism" 
 Like most people, before I spend money on a DVD, I read all the cover descriptions first.   The back cover starts with a breathless announcement about Dan Brown's book. Then it lists a series of questions by the book's detractors.   Based on the cover description, I honestly thought this DVD was going to be a reasoned "second opinion" regarding the historical information that Dan Brown uses as part of his novel.   I had no idea that the DVD was actually just a rehash of the same theories minus the mystery-thriller context. I'm guessing the marketers deliberately meant to ensnare people of faith into thinking they were purchasing an opposing view.  This DVD should be called: "The Da Vinci Code," Part Deux 
 Do NOT buy this product. I donated my entire box to the local food bank. Cream filling has some peculiar smell such that you will not feel like eating these cookies. Seriously stay away for this produc 
 I failed to realize that this was a book "edited" by as opposed to written "by" David Sedaris until his introduction. Incidentally, the introduction was the only portion of the book that I actually enjoyed. His analogy about his favorite song in middle school is not accurate in that his classmates did not have to  pay to learn his affinity towards what may have been a bad song. I do not find it endearing that he does not care what others think of his tastes.  I do not think they were bad stories. Actually, I would like to take that back, if entertainment is a measure of quality to me they were bad. It was, however, impressive how one of the writers was able to use most of the GRE vocabulary words in one short story.   I will not stop buying the books that David Sedaris authors, I will just be more careful. David Sedaris is a brilliant writer/storyteller. He may not capture all or even any of the elements of a "good" short story; I would not know an element of a good short story if I ran into one coming off the elevator. I do know that David Sedaris' stories are excellent in that they are entertaining and make no pretense of intellectualism. I can not wait for the next book he actually writes 
 I was really surprised how such a book can be published. It deals only with AHP! AHP! AHP! [If you would like to know more about Analytic Hierarchy Process[AHP] - Just buy books written by Saaty ] and very little about other decision making techniques . Triantaphyllou's  book  has no organization and clear structure. Believe me you will end up learning nothing from this book.  There are several other good books which are available better look for it folk 
 I purchased this little sweeper to sweep up bird seed and crumbs on the floor from the kids.  For the bird seed it's ok as long as you make a couple passes.  For food and feathers it seems to pick up about half.  Also, I've only had this sweeper 6 months and the battery slowly died and I always fully discharged and then charged the battery. I would suggest getting anopther sweeper that has suction and not just a revolving brush 
 Normally I wouldn't waste my time... Normally I would write a "real" view. but.... I hate this band... time and time again I buy the album thinking "maybe just maybe" and everytime... I am dissapointed they suck more and more... They are barly in the rock genre... they cry almost enough to be cosidered childrens music... I hate them... Don't buy it... DON"T DO IT 
 In reading this book I found absolutely nothing that would be anything close to a winning system. The "Five Count" and all variations, when tested at length is merely a way of limiting your losses in hopes of staying at the table longer and hitting a hot roll before you run out of money. As with most craps books this one may teach you to manage your money and remind you about discipline 
 This book, after the opening tour through england, leaves us with nothing to capture about the NSA. He writes well as a university student. But his research could have been obtained in a salon reading Bamford's books; nothing new. I was surprised when nothing is said of Israel's communication links, or with Britain's, since he alludes to MI 5 frequently, conduct in Ireland. Much is missing from this first book...it may help with his tuition with his timing 
 This album was one of the worst Journey albums ever. The songs heavily lean towards sappy soft rock with terrible lyrics. I personally loved Open Arms, Faithfully, and most of Journey's Greatest Hits but this album is definitely NOT up to par. Perhaps it has a lot to do with Perry's voice no longer being a smooth golden sounding tenor. Instead it's unbearably raspy and sounds like he's straining for every note. Too bad he didn't classically train his voice to preserve his sound. Or maybe it was the drugs n' alcohol that did him in. Whatever the case, his voice is very rough and unpleasant sounding on this album.    1. Message of Love - nice new-wave instrumental intro but lyrics sucked "I walk alone in the dark without you ... in the shadows of love" Terrible song, the catchy hook was horrid as well - "Baby can you hear my message of love" Could not get into this song at all.  2. One More - there's a trend to the songs on this album, the intros are deceiving, the songs start off with a nice beat but once Perry sings the first few banal lyrics, you're instantly turned off.   3. When You Love a Woman - the only decent sounding song on this album. This Grammy-nominated tune has nice hooks and Perry's raspy voice is somewhat pleasant to listen to. Lyrically, it's nothing special to write home about it other than your cheesy love song.  4. If He Should Break Your Heart - Again a nice soft rock start but then the chorus title is repeated so many times turns it into an unbearably lame tune.  5. Forever in Blue - This song sucked from the beginning intro. As soon as I heard Perry sing "When she walked into the room" I thought oh god, not another lame love song. Recycling their lyric "two hearts" doesn't save this song from the rubbish bin.  6. Castles Burning - Absolutely the worst song on the album. Perry sounding like Tina Turner with a painfully sounding strained voice. This song tries to be a rocker but ends up as pitiful noisy nonsense.   7. Don't Be Down on Me Baby - A failed attempt for a R&B song. Again the lyrics were terrible.   8. Still She Cries - Lovely guitar intro and nice "We were good" chorus. But the rest of lyrics didn't help the song stand out at all.  9. Colors of the Spirit - An unremarkable song that is quickly forgotten.  10. When I Think of You - By the 10th song on the album, I'm feeling like enough of the sappy love songs. Yet again, Journey or maybe Perry himself fails to make a memorable impact. Lukewarm lyrics and vocals.  11. Easy to Fall - Another false start with a bluesy start but the song disintegrates into yet another bland love song.  12. Can't Tame the Lion - Finally, a bit of a beat to wake me up from my coma after suffering through 11 tracks of soft rock. Sadly, the incredibly stupid lyrics - can't tame the lion just ruins whatever momentum the song started.  13. It's Just the Rain - I'm happy by this song, not because it's a wonderful song, but because it's nearing the end album and I no longer have to suffer through it to write this review. This song fails yet again due to horrid lyrics and a nondescript melody.  14. Trial by Fire - For a title song this song is not memorable at all. At this point, I don't feel like I can go on listening to this slow-moving tripe. So many talents in the band were wasted by poor songwriting and not a single hit song.  15. Baby I'm a Leavin' You - Finally, I've reached the end of the album. It's nice to hear Journey try out a reggae beat on their songs but UB40 they definitely are not. Perry's vocals and lyrics somehow destroy whatever pleasant sound this song could have been.   I'm glad I bought this CD cheaply as a used item otherwise I would have been mad if I paid full price for such an atrocious album 
 The main Participents, in a debate about the validity of the Resurrection: Gerd Ludemann (anti-resurrection) and William Lane Craig (pro-resurrection), with additional commentary by diverse others. Can anything be learned from the debate? More can be learned by any of a long list of books by unbiased, serious and well qualified theologians. Personally, I do not consider Craig  a theologian at the level Of Vermesh, Ehrman, Meier, Brown, Sanders, Fredrickson, Pagels, Crossan, or any number of others. To me he is more like a TV evangelist, who argues his from his beliefs/prejudices like a politician, where anything goes, not from unquestionable, academic  evidence.  Am I a Christian? Yes. Do I believe that God exists? Yes. Do I believe that God can or could have Resurrected Jesus or anyone else had He wished to do that? Yes. Do I believe that Wm. Lane Craig has a legitimate, argument supported by several independent and unbiased pieces of written evidence, the minimal requirement for a graduate thesis, as required in such an academic debate, in thisbook and this "debate"? A resounding NO!   In fact he cannot, no one can, because, at least at this point there is no such evidence available. The "evidence" he cites is not evidence at all, it is a collection of biased writings by biased men who were not witnesses to the event-if it did happen. Most of the writers of the New Testament were not even born when Jesus died. By-the-Way, if Jesus was born during Herod the Great's reign, and Herod died during or before 4 BC, and Jesus was at least 2 years old or less, Jesus would have died between 25-29 AD, not 33 AD, a difference of 4-8 years, and since we have heard from historical sources outside of the New Testament that John the Baptist died in 37 AD, after Jesus, and that Quirynius was not governor until Jesus was a teenager, thus could not have ordered a census in Bethlehem, 13 years before he was stationed in Jerusalem, and those are merely the least of the Testament's errors, they are not a most reliable source for such a claim. No, unbiased source has ever verified the Resurrection, only those with a strong `bias in favor of such an act of God. None of the above was ever established as fact by any source other than the four canonical Gospels, and the other canonical works. One of which was certainly doctored, all of which were edited, redacted and written, not by Apostles, but by people whose names we do not even know for certain, and written beginning with Mark, at least 37 years after the death of Jesus and ending with John 77-88 years after the death of Jesus. Having said that, this was neither the most thrilling nor best-argued debate. All of Craig's evidence is based on the four gospels and in an academic debate, the very materials which veracity are in question, are not considered evidential. Craig cites the following as established facts, which by rule of evidence they certainly are not. 1) Jesus was buried, (2) Jesus' tomb was discovered empty, (3) Some people report having seen Jesus after his death, and (4) Jesus' ollowers preached the resurrection when they had every reason not to.  The debate is boring to anyone with a solid background in theology, it smacks of showbiz and is not a serious or meaningful thing and serves little purpose. It is more like watching CNBC than the BBC.  Do I believe that Jesus was resurrected? I do, but that is a matter of faith, not tangeable evidence. I give it  2.25 Stars 
 This machine is totally a waste of time, you would never ever make a pasta in 15 minutes, you would make the pasta in 4-5 hours.  The mesurements of the flours and eggs would never make the appropiate mixture. After lossing your 5 hours to make the mixture, you get the second problem, the mix would not get in the hole so the pasta can get the form you want b/c is to dry for the mixture to go down that hole.  If you want fresh pasta you are better off buying a manual machine and do it your self, or better yet go to the supermarket and they would have fresh pasta on the fridge. 
 Warner television should have discontinue this title after releasing Season 10 which they didn't. although this Item had been in sale for a long period on amazon.com, but buying this even for 6 dollars is totallt waste of money cause all the stuff are available on season 10! It could be worth if it was a real limited or collectors ediotion, packed with some extra stuff such as slip cover, collectible booklet, journal or something like that. but it was so far not a limited edition though. It had even no insert card! I can see this brilliant LIMITED EDITION! I think there is over a billion copies that they beg people to buy it in lowest price possible and still they have copies to sell 
 P.J. O'Rourke, a "fellow" at the Washington-based Cato Institute, sets out to answer the question "why do some places prosper and thrive while others just suck?" The problem with that premise is that... well the premise sucks.  Being based on yardsticks like GDP, GNP, GNR (and potentially the NFL and NHL) the book is fashioned in terms used by contemporary and illegitimate, notions which do not reflect progress, happiness or well-being and instead focus on how much companies can sell you stuff.   Economics is discussed as a passing topic as relates to O'Rourke's observations, but the bulk of the book is a human essay combined with the author's travelogue of places like Moscow, Hong Kong, Tanzania, Albania, Cuba and more. Of course, humour being the front man, the writer duly agrees upfront that the numbers are crap, the facts are a joke, Republicans need a plug or two (as do 'non-partisan' [snort] think-tanks), but the book is hit and miss both philosophically and stylistically. The book asks good questions, but P.J. is not an awfully good writer. The passages veer between funny and plain old boring or sophisticated and akin to someone hollering at a frat part. The naked observations of far-flung places are, perhaps, the best part of the book given the absurdity of the situation. Fathoming and shaping reality in order to lasso intellectual discourse can only go so far however (CNN is an alternate universe).   O'Rourke might like to call Sweden socialist as a put-down, which is all good given that Scandinavian country's untouchable credentials, but last some one checked workers did not own the means of production there. Cuba might have throngs of people standing around doing nothing - isn't that the forte of think-tanks? - yet it would be fun to see how the country would do without American embargoes and overt aggression. A "laissez-faire" attitude towards commerce might have propelled a strategically-located rock called Hong Kong into riches (there is that subjective term, again), but how does the author explain the centrally planned and executed economies of Korea, China, Malaysia, Singapore or Dubai which have recently outpaced beacons of capitalism like America and Haiti? To criticize the use of Mandarin by Chinese officials in Hong Kong makes sense until, only a second later, one notices that the use of English is even more absurd and foreign there.   Stick with the one about the skeleton in the bar next time, P.J 
 This is a polished proposal for the invasion of Iraq. It was highly praised in 2002. In retrospect, it was a bit too candid:   "Assembling a coalition would be infinitely easier if the United States could point to a smoking gun with Iraqi fingerprints on it -- some new Iraqi outrage that would serve to galvanize international opinion and create a pretext for invasion. Saddam's pursuit of nuclear weapons is the real reason for invading, but because estimates vary widely on how long it will take for Iraq to do so, and because some countries simply assert Iraq is not doing so and dismiss all of the evidence to the contrary, that may not appear to be an imminent enough threat to justify the march to war, especially for those countries (such as France, Russia, and Turkey) which do not want to see Saddam overthrown."   No doubt Feith and Wumser in the Office of Special Plans took this to heart ("Within a very short period of time, they began to find links that nobody else had previously understood or recorded in a useful way" - Richard Perle, PBS Frontline Oct 2003). Niger yellowcake, Al Qaeda ties, aluminum tubes, unmanned drones, mobile bio-labs, plagiarized studies, and "smoking gun in the form of mushroom cloud" followed. All were needed to create "outrage" to sell invasion.   The lies are now blissfully forgotten, and felonious collaborator Chalibi firmly controls the Oil Ministry. Most countries failed to buy the sales pitch (maybe they didn't want to see international law overthrown: they were right about the threat).   Is this important? Reinhard Heydrich was tasked to provide an incident on the German-Polish border to justify invasion in 1939. His `attack' on a Gleiwitz radio station (`Operation Himmler') murdered KZ prisoners in Polish uniforms to provide a `smoking gun.'   This book, and the invasion it helped engender, became illegal when it's claims (WMD, etc) failed to materialize post invasion. It can not, and should not, so easily be excused as `faulty intelligence.' It was then (and remains) an invitation to aggressive war.   "Any resort to war - to any kind of war - is a resort to means that are inherently criminal. War inevitably is a course of killings, assaults, deprivations of liberty, and destruction of property. An honestly defensive war is, of course, legal, and saves those conducting it from criminality. But inherently criminal acts cannot be defended by showing that those who committed them were engaged in a war, when war itself is illegal." -Justice Robert H. Jackson; Nï¿½remberg 1945.   The author is worth reading (I enjoyed this book in 2002, but wasn't convinced). His proposition was then (given the inspections option), and is now, as illegal as crimes prosecuted at Nï¿½remberg. He has since has moved on to targeting Iran.   Meanwhile, American firms feast on Iraqi oil and no-bid reconstruction. Four years after 9/11, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al Zawahiri, and Mullah Omar remain at large 
 This book was recommended to me by an inspirational speaker who spoke at my college. I can see how this book can be meant to inspire, especially the stories pertaining to "live your dream". Yes, this book does give you hope and to a certain degree persuades you to break the shackles which you have created for yourself; to break the rut which sometimes becomes our lives. Having said that, some stories were (to be perfectly honest) cheesy. Corny, even. "The Hugging Judge"? Come on, that sounds more like a scene from a C grade kid movie. Even so, good read at times, inspiring also .....at times. Short concise stories. Worth a read if you are willing to forgive the extra extra dose of too much sugar in the sou 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 I admit that I'm addicted - despite the s.l.o.w. progress, constant female bickering, and frequent fashion details.  I want to see how this dang series ends...will it?    This particular installment of the Dragon et. al. left me feeling underwhelmed.  The ending was a disappointment, but I'll press on and order book 8.  
 I read more than 100 trading books; this is the worst one!!!!!!!!!!! I can't understand how it's possible that there are here so many positive comments, may be they have russian origin 
 As an obvious fan of Tomas Pain, the author is no Tomas Pain either.  She rants on a scholarly level then recedes back to teenage speak: like, you know, totally.  This is a book with a thinly veiled premise of Dr. Harry Frankfurt "ON BS" but it turns out to be a political rant on the United States by a Canadian.  It is painfully evident that the author has no business or political training other than from The Daily Show.  She does, however, briefly mention that the Canadian government does some BS things but it is apparently more fun to drone on about the US.  She would have benefited from a facts checker.  Maybe this book was supposed to be in the spirit of Lewis Black but it fails from the start.  It was neither funny nor very entertaining and riddled with half truths and far reaching facts. She comes across as just being bitc**y.  But then this was a book about Bull****.  What you see is what you get, BS.   
 I purchased this book because of the time it takes to assemble a shopping list for both "The Perricone Promise" and "The Perricone Weight Loss Diet". I thought this would do it for it. It lists a "basic guideline for foods", but it is not comprehensive of all the items needed to make the recipes on the two week diet. I'm still painstakingly going through the recipes to assemble my shopping list 
 I borrowed a copy of this book from my sister once. Now she thinks it silly above all else, but I, being a second degree Pagan, was frightened at what Mr. Ridenour says in his work, frightened that Biblical Christianity is indeed the right religion after all, despite all the evidence to the contrary.  And that is how he wants his readers to respond.  This is a book that strives to undermine reason, to assault knowledge, and to convert people who otherwise would become better people following a different faith. If a Muslim fundamentalist were writing this book, it would turn out exactly the same way, excepting that everything would be compared to fundamental Islam, not fundamental Christianity. Mark Twain was absolutely right when he noted that "Man is the only animal that has the true religion, several of them." The sooner Mr. Ridenour realizes these things, the better off he will be spiritually.  But this book should be censored. It would be better for the public's spiritual health not to feel threatened by Mr. Ridenour's argument and his tone.  And, besides, he gives Christianity a bad name 
 Again i throught this would of been another bad seagal film wasnt to bad better than attack force as i read in a interview the reason to all these bad movies cos something to with the comapnys and money and few others things so ic an why steven hasnt put all into all of his movies but still i am  seagal fan and i didnt mind this one don't blame steven for bad movies blame the peole behind the scren get off his bac 
 John Calvin blazed the trail for most reformed reviewers: if you disagree with what is said, kill the 'sayer'.  Ad hominem critique, attempting to discredit an idea by crushing its advocate, is particularly odious in theological discussion but many of the chapters is this book raise it to an art form.  The argument of this book:  the classical description of God = the Biblical description of God: take our word for it, we are the experts, no discussion needed.  anyone who disagrees with us is obviously inspired by satan to destroy Christianity.  God loves only people who think like us - to hell (literally) with the others.  Classical theology presents a picture of God as a disconnected (in His ultimate nature), unfeeling, micro manager who chooses to allow evil when He could stop it.  As a recovering Calvinist who finally read the Scriptures and took them seriously (how's that for a back door ad hominem? I've still got it) it appears God has revealed himself in the Bible as something diferent: a loving, involved creator/father who is working with His children to restore a fallen world.  If you are looking for argument by stipulation, Beyond the Bounds is for you.  If you want careful analysis of germane scripture passages, look elsewhere 
 I was very disappointed, after having just read Life After Life, a book I found particularly uplifting.  Since I find mirror gazing, and crystal balls, on the same level as Ouija boards, I didn't find this book  especially awe inspiring.  As a matter of fact, I struggled to finish it 
 One of my favorite things about Dean Koontz is the Hook:  He usually comes up with a supernatural or quasi-scientific phenomenon that I cannot figure out right away.  Something really weird will happen at the start of the book, and I will devour the book to try to figure it out.  Usually, the mystery gets solved about 1/2 of 2/3s of the way through, and the solution is typically pretty cool.  The rest of the book will be fun because by then, I care about the characters and I like a good, satisfying resolution.  The villains are ruthless and relentless and the plot is Terminator-fast.  One of my least favorite things about Koontz is the Cheese:  His dialogue and interior monologues are often so forced and cutesy.  He tries really hard to be funny but instead winds up smarmy and artificial.  Forever Odd omits the Hook, leaving only Cheese.  If you've read Odd Thomas, you already know that like the kid in The 6th Sense (a bit too much like him, in fact), Odd can see dead people.  And even if you haven't, Koontz explains this right away in this sequel.  So the hook is absent and the only other mystery is why his friend gets kidnapped, but it's not really much of a mystery.  Plus, the villain is absurd and not the least bit frightening.    So the book didn't draw me in at all.  Also, Forever Odd is almost all cheese.  Odd makes all sorts of oh-so-cute observations and wisecracks, none of which is either cute or funny.  Worst of all for me, though, may be how religiously dogmatic Mr. Koontz is growing in his old age.  Now, sure, you can say that it's only the voice of his character, Odd, except it isn't.  This stuff runs through most of Koontz's recent books.  In the Koontz worldview, all universities seem to teach is anarchy, godlessness and solipsism.  The human race is a tribe of desperate, amoral cretins.  No one any longer ascribes to what Koontz refers to as "the Truth," with a capital T.  Other religions (other than Catholic, that is) are pagan superstitions, and anyone who is agnostic or atheistic is by definition amoral, as though it is impossible to have a moral code or live by the Golden Rule without reference to a higher power.  As much as I enjoy Koontz when he shines (see Intensity for a great yarn), I need that Hook, I hate this Cheese, and I really could do without the religious arrogance and chauvinism.  It grows old.  Really old. 
 Elizabeth Peters is one of my top 5 favorite authors ever.  However, this book is really bad.  I couldn't even finish it, and I really hate to stop in the middle of a book.  If you haven't read this yet, don't; read _The Crocodile on the Sandbank_ instead.  If you've already read this, please don't judge Ms Peters by this work.  I urge you to give her another shot, because _The Camelot Caper_ is well below the quality of her other books. 
 It was a great product when it worked.  Sleek design, super user friendly, sharp image and easily unlock to all region.  Never had any problem loading or playing until last week.  Went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie.  Swallowed the DVD with it.  It would've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least 
 Interesting only because it was made by Europe's premier exploitation director, "Kitty" is tedious and has pretensions to being an expose of the Nazis. This film is nothing more than a forerunner of the Italian (...) genre that flourished briefly in the 1970's. As to the controversial and perverse elements - they are clumsily handled and pointless. You'll find more (...) readily available elsewhere and the horror of the Nazis is presented much more graphically and forcefully in movies by Speilberg and Polanski to name but two. If you're interested in a more thoughtful attempt at controversy from Italian directors with better artistic credentials, you might try "Seeds of Evil" and Pasolini's "Salo: 100 Days of Sodom" 
 Nrretranders is not a scientist or researcher, but rather a science journalist.  That isn't necessarliy a bad thing in itself, but his book clearly suffers for his lack of scientific training, and the rigour it would have introduced.  User Illusion reads like a series of breezy, vastly oversimplified pop-sci articles.  His concepts - ranging from info theory to thermodynamics, are strung together with the loosest of connections.  For example, he compares the information intake of our senses with that processed by our consciousness in terms of bits.  But, he clearly has no formal definition of a bit in mind, using it to refer to anything from an actual binary bit, all the way up to an entire piece of music.  This makes it impossible to take his comparison seriously.  Consciousness itself is never even formally defined.  His treatment near the end of the earth's energy intake, and even dirty diapers, in terms of information theory is laughable.  The only useful take-away here is the reminder that there is a lot more going on inside our heads than we are consciously aware of.  A useful reminder, but that should not be news to anyone.  User Illusion also makes a good index of current (in 1991) 'sexy' science topics such as complexity 
 my 2 1/2 year was interested in this seat right away, much more so than his small potty. However, he cries every time because the small bump in the front is not sufficient enough of a splash guard. He gets wet, the floor and his step stool are all wet. Clean up is a nightmare. It's in the trash now. 
 A useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing Accounting Standards and approaches between countries.  However, it is not worth the price.  It is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students.  It is more suitable for general second year accounting students.  Plus, as I am working with a multinational European bank in Japan, the book is, rapidly becoming, out of date.  There is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries 
 We bought this book for our daughter for her 1st birthday.  We had to take it away from her almost immediately because one of the pages has a sheep on it and she was able to eat pieces of the cotton off of the sheep 
 I had read several reviews here before purchasing this product, but went ahead and bought it anyway, thinking that Logitech might have fixed their quality problems since those reviews were posted.  I was wrong.  After a few weeks of satisfactory use (long enough to get past Amazon's reasonable window for returns), the space bar started working intermittently.  Incredibly annoying, and it renders the device unusable for all practical purposes.  Even before the space bar turned against me I was unimpressed with the feel of the keys (I use a Dell wireless keyboard, an Apple wireless keyboard and the keyboard on my IBM X-series laptop).  Bottom line - the thing looks great on a desk, and it is nicely compact, but it probably won't do what you need it to.  Look elsewhere 
 Probably my least favourite of the books I have read by this author. And I love him, I do. Just not this one.  The bit on the back sounds really good, "crazy rain making people into savage killers!" Neat. But the book isn't that good, it really isn't. It's BORING. I don't know how it's possible for crazy rain making people into savage killers to be boring, but it is.  I will never be convinced that if a woman has been raped, her clothes ripped off during an attack, or there's a naked female corpse, that apparently ALL males nearby will become sexually excited. I mean... you're under attack by crazy, slime-covered maniacs, your wife is freaking out, your child is home with the babysitter and you don't know if she's okay, people are being disemboweled and torn to pieces around you... and you're still going to take the time (much less be able) to become excited at the sight of a half-dressed woman?  Also ridiculous is the fact that when the character John realizes that the maniacs can be "cured", he still rampantly and without remorse shoots them in the head and kills them. Hmmm.  I don't even want to get into the fact that Richard Laymon talks about the little 8 year old girl's "panties". Not cool. He always does this in his books, "rumps" and "panties"... but my god. This is supposed to be a CHILD. Pretty gross.  This is not his goriest book, his most creepy, nor his most interesting. Not a good Laymon book at all. 
 I love Yvonne Porcella's work.  It has a distinctive look, filled with simple shapes and bright primary colors.  Sadly, most of that is missing in this book.  I can just hear the publisher telling her to use varied palettes to appeal to more people.  Who knows? Maybe she will.  But somehow I can't see the repro and plaid crowd wanting to make her freeform quilts. If they want to, there are instructions for how to assemble a conglomeration of 4-patch and 9-patch units with spacer strips.  In trying to please everyone, the book ended up being neither traditional nor contemporary and all the magic is missing 
 The clappy-happy endorsements of this book are unbelievable shills- like the book itself. Keep looking. There are much better books out there. And no, Heiman doesn't need it, and Tom Hopkins is definately not the pick of the litter 
 Not much substance here, just a collection of 'stories' from other people. Money is best spent elsewhere with an author who has actually done real estate deals, not just collect stories from others. 
 I expected this book to be fun take on the Hollywood nanny experience where the reader can peek at the "other side" and perhaps try to guess who might be the real people behind the pseudonyms.  Nope.  Susanne Hansen is a cad who betrays her former employers (and her nanny friends' employers) by exposing their private family dynamics for entertainment and ridicule.  It would have been much, MUCH better had she changed names and focused more on the celebrity lifestyle gossipy end of it than in her own boring self-examinations and snotty judgements.  In every page she obsesses over wealth and then condemns the very people whose assets she admires.  She seems to think that shallow and neglectful parenting is something only to be found in the nanny-hiring set.  There was no joy in reading this book once I realized that while she may have changed the children's names, the names of the parents were quite real.  It puts the lie to how much she felt for her charges that she would so humiliate their parents in pursuit of the almighty dollar 
 An hysterical defense and rationalization of the neo-conservative creed of democratic imperialism. The real world consequences of that brand of trotskyism have proven ignoble enough not to insist here. To a certain extent this is a criminal book, yet another on an already too long list 
 What happened?  Instead of continuing on with this fantastic series, the animators decided to use one whole DVD volume to recap all events up to this point.  Did someone in the production team realize that the series was going to be one DVD short in filling up the box set & they decided to remedy that?  Get Vol. 4 ONLY if you have short term memory issues or like looooooooong flashbacks.  Otherwise skip to Volume 5, you'll be glad you did 
 I am a big fan of Kathryn Harrison.  I've voraciously read Exposure and Poison and recommended them to everyone I know.  And that's why I'm particularly disappointed in her latest novel.  Who doesn't know about Ms. Harrison's memoir -- The Kiss -- a true-life recollection of her incestuous relationship with her father?  The author is a veteran of therapy.  And here, therapy-talk takes over.  None of it, however, rings particularly true.  For example, here's an excerpt of Will, talking to his 70ish father, whom he recently discovered was having an affair:  "Dad?  When you're working -- do you ever feel something being revealed to you?  That your consciousness is heightened -- augmented, maybe -- by a force outside of your own intellect?"  Who TALKS like this?  The book is filled with sentences that sound, not like the characters, but like the author.  Here's another, from a patient (Will is a psychoanalyst):  "(He's) very old-school, very houndstooth tweedy.  He's so central casting that it's actually cute in a kind of avuncular way."  What twenty-something do you know who would describe someone in that way?  The characters don't ring true.  They never come to life on their own.  The psychoanalysis is very "pop" variety -- a real surprise since Ms. Harrison knows the subject so well.  I felt irritated as I read along...especially knowing this talented writer is capable of so much more 
 OK, I had heard "Annapolis" was a pale imitation of "An Officer and a Gentleman"--but I still went into it with an open mind.  Just because a film shares similar plot points or qualities with another film doesn't mean it isn't worthy of a look.  There are only so many plots to go around--take romantic comedies, for example.  If you got rid of those that copied other movies, we'd be left with about six total in the history of cinema.  If something is done well, it can defy its limitations and seem fresh.  Heck, it isn't even as if "An Officer and a Gentleman" was a novel or new story--it played by fairly conventional storytelling rules, it just did so exceedingly well.  So, trying as hard as possible to offer a different perspective--I, too, feel that "Annapolis" borrows heavily from "Officer."  It's all here.  Boy from wrong side of the tracks makes good in the service--check.  Cadet who can't complete obstacle course helped by hero--check.  Cadet who doesn't succeed attempts suicide--check.  Hero's tension with superior leads up to big fight--check.  Mutual respect, triumph over adversity--check, check, CHECK already.  By jettisoning the romance at the heart of "Officer," "Annapolis" is left with only the cliche'--becoming a good person through military service.   But even that pales in comparison.  James Franco is a good actor, but he is becoming increasingly expressionless.  It's as if he thinks a dour expression equals seriousness.  Richard Gere (in "Officer"), meanwhile, ran a real emotional gamut--rage, passion, heartbreak.  He made a very typical story moving and powerful.  But, of course, he had Louis Gossett, in an Oscar winning performance, to play off of.  Let's just say that Tyrese Gibson isn't in that league.  As the female lead, we've got Jordana Brewster.  She is appealing and likable, if not particularly believable in this role.  One of my main issues with "Annapolis" is its sloppy character development.  Franco is regarded as the worst cadet in the unit, and as such is really ridden by his superiors.  He is a loner, doesn't ask for help--so you know a valuable life lesson will need to be learned.  Gere, in "Officer," was just such a recruit.  But the moment he is broken, the moment of his realization--it is a brilliant and emotionally devastating scene played to perfection.  In "Annapolis," though, blink and you'll miss it--there's no catharsis here.  One night he just decides to be a great recruit.  He then studies all night to improve his scores, trains for boxing all day and night for a big tournament, and helps his roommate on the obstacle course all day.  I don't know when he sleeps or does any real "soldiering."     "Annapolis" is, essentially at heart, a chaste and glossy remake.  But lacking the dynamic performances and the realness, it just falls short as entertainment.  No deeper than a typical music video, it's all surface--pretty to look at, but ultimately forgettable.

 Nice compact box, and recording quality better than I expected.   One major flaw though, no preview when recording 640x480 resolution, just a black screen with 'REC' in the top corner.  Dropping back to 320x240 resolution doesn't help, this just displays the video preview in a tiny letter-box in the center of the display.  A real shame, I love the concept, but the lack of preview is a real problem.   Technical support claims that a future firmware upgrade will fix it, I'll keep my fingers crossed, but don't have high expectations 
 Hope you like fat because this book pushes it!!!!  For most of these recipes, 1 of the 3 ingredients is either butter, olive oil or cheese.  Who doesn't enjoy the taste of pure forms of fat?  Book did motivate me to share my own favorite 3-ingredient recipe:   Poor Man's Asparagus   8 oz smoked cheddar cheese 3 eggs 2 cups grass clippings (from where the mower bag attaches for that extra fine grind)     Mix and bake.  I recommend of the Campbell Soup cookbooks (any edition)for simplicity and satisfaction 
 Okay let me get this straight.  If I wear dreadlocks, throwback sports apparel, big sunglasses, put some radiators in my mouth, act drunk, and scream lame unintelligible raps I too can be a big star?  Alas, there is no accounting for taste or the lack thereof.  Scuse me whilst I look for a bridge to leap from 
 Before Darren Aronofsky turned "The Fountain" into a beautiful movie, this exquisite story of life, death and love was made into a graphic novel. But the graphic novel is a stumbling experience, whose beautiful dialogue and heartrending situations are   The story follows three intertwined storylines -- a conquistador named Tomas, who is battling the Mayans, and thinking of Queen Isabella back in Spain. Then there's a doctor named Tom in the present, who is struggling to save his dying wife from a brain tumor, by using an extract from a strange tree.   But death cannot be pushed away, and Izzy succumbs to her cancer -- but Tom won't accept it. It the future, Tom is transporting the tree to a distant nebula, struggling to defeat death once and for all. But is death an end, "nothing"? Or will he fulfil Izzy's last request and finish her book about Tomas the conquistador, and the Tree of Life?   It's an exquisite story, full of moving emotion and mystical connections -- everything from Christianity's story of the tree of good and evil to Mayan myths show up in Tom's journey. This is illustrated through the rings in each story -- tattooed, gifted and wedding -- and the eerie, surreally beautiful climax.   And Aronofsky tackles the ultimate question of life -- is death an end, or a beginning? Does the existance of death give us greater life? And can love reach out beyond the grave?   Unfortunately, Kent Williams' artwork simply doesn't measure up to the exquisite storyline. It feels like a bunch of your basic graphic artists were collaborating in their different styles, only to hit a deadline and turn in the unfinished work. He captures delicate moments -- such as Tomas kissing Isabella's ring -- but the rest of the time, I felt it lacked.   Sometimes there's no background, just aqua splashes or colorless sketched figures. Some of the characters look like photographs cut-and-pasted, and with tacky surroundings merely added in, while at other times they are fully sketched and detailed. And worst of all, it's hard to follow the story because the characters never look the same. Every few pages, they change appearance radically -- Izzy even changes ethnicity for a few panels.   "The Fountain" has a brilliant story, but Kent Williams wasn't up to the task of bringing Darren Aronofsky's beautiful story to life. Too bad, because the story itself is full of bittersweet purity 
 I started this book because I love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation.  Yes, there are moments of great wit.  However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book.  It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing.  It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree.  Certainly a unique achievement, I guess.  But so is Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music.&quot 
 I cannot understand why this book got so many good reviews. I'm not saying that if I didn't like it, no one can or should, but I really don't understand. It's so tedious. Every little thing in these unbelievable characters' lives is described to such great length. Unnecessarily so. Why do we need to know all the details about every piece of art work this guy made? A summary would do. And to take soooooo long before getting to the point. It's like half the book was merely background to the reall thing, but why so long?! And the characters don't come alive despite all those details. They don't feel like people, just mouthpieces for views on hysteria and art. No matter what, I just didn't care about any of the characters. And even as a novel of ideas, I think this one would fail. The ideas are not developed, they're described like self-gratification, something you may take from a friend but not someone you don't care about. So, clearly I didn't like this one. I would just like to understand what I missed that made all those others love the book so much 
 Great concept, I found the book to be pretty uninspired and choppy.  The author definitely was influenced by ESPNs Sports Guy Bill Simmons, reads like a less skilled Simmons rant.  I wish I could agree with the other reviews 
 How he gets away with it I will never understand.Orson Welles was a Clown who dedicated his life to food and to criticize art in all of its forms.(that's what you do when you can't make art)Don't worry,there is always Rossellini,Fellini,Renoir,Bergman,Dreyer... ... 
 The 20% you need to know: This book is poorly written, and the author would do well to use the 80/20 principle in his writing.  The 80% that will make up the rest of the review: I have never read such boring prose. I've had the concept fully explained to me. I fully understand what the principle is. I have heard it about 80 times now when 20 would have been enough (actually, once would have been enough). Now, what do I do with it? How do I implement it into my life? I am now on page 53 and he still hasn't gotten around to that part. It seems to me he should have used the theory when writing this book. Cut to the chase! Give me the top 20% of useful information so I can go ahead and use it to increase my productivity and effectiveness by 80%. Instead I get the feeling I'm wandering around aimlessly in the bottom part of his bar charts among the 80% of fluff to fill up his book quota. How many stories about economists and computer software do we really need? I don't know about you, but I wanted to increase my productivity by using my time better, and reading this book so far has been a complete waste of it 
 Like many others, I too was thrilled to see Frederik Pohl was even still writing, let alone writing books about the Heechee saga, which I loved. So, I grabbed this book off the shelf - hard cover or not, this was a Heechee book!  But... Now I've read the book, I wonder just where exactly did Pohl intend to go with the book? It starts somewhere towards the end of the original Heechee sage books, but spends copious amounts of time summarising and rehashing the stuff from the previous novels - in case we have forgotten, I guess. Then finally we move on from refamiliarising ourselves with many of the old cast of characters and go...  Nowhere. I mean, the characters of yesteryear seem to be bland colourless carbon copies of themselves, the new characters seem to have barely been sketched out before being relegated to Bland Land. And despite a promising title, at the end of the day, I'm not even sure who the "boy" is, and if living for ever means having a baby, well... Hardly a revolutinary plot line! I believe that would imply we are all currently living forever right now as long as we procreate?!  Anyway, the book was a fun read, it was light, somewhat witty and not unbearable. But it was shallow, directionless, meaningless and with little plot. I can only hope that like the first Red Dwarf book that came out, this one is going to go somewhere in another book??? 
 The sound is low, static-ky, and it frequently dropped calls. Boo. 
 Never even opened this book, because when it arrived I found that it is a Christian book, which would be fine if I were in fact Christian...  But I'm not.  Just wanted to warn others of the many other faiths in the world that if you are not Christian this book is not for you.  Wish I had read Zelda's review because a book that espouses anti-gay and anti-woman beliefs would not help my depression at all, and would in fact make me even more depressed that that kind of bigotry gets backed by a publisher.  Also, hearing that being born a woman makes me less than somehow doesn't make me feel overjoyed.   Glad I bought this used and very cheap.  Had to give it away.  
 I attended a workshop with this dangerous charlatan. I was truly shocked by what I witnessed. This self-procliamed messiah had an almost hypnotic effect on his devotees. He appealed to their egos by telling them they are the "chosen ones" privy to the wisdom of the "ancient mystery schools." But there's a catch,to be a part of his special circle one must embrace thier darkness. "I am the darkness" is the mantra of those who follow this man. And the results are what you might expect puppet-like people who slump and then stand to attention depending on their master's pull of the string. 
 The leaves are changing color and the days are getting cooler.  " I smell winter in the air," said bear.  " It is time for me to crawl into my cave and sleep."  " But I must tell snail  first."   	As a forest of friends, realize that the leaves are  changing and that winter is coming, they must tell each other. It starts  with bear, and she tells snail.  Snail tells skunk then skunk must tell  turtle and the list goes on. Finally, ladybug gets the message and she goes  to tell bear.  When she gets there, bear is already sleeping in her cave.  Lady bug wakes up bear and tells her that winter is near and that is time  for her to crawl into her cave and sleep.  Bear says "Ladybug, I am in  my cave and I was sleeping." Ladybug says she is sorry.   Then all the  animals say goodnight to each other. 	This book is not very exciting  compared to most children's books. There is not really a turning point.   All that the tale does is repeat the same thing from animal to animal. The  animals just tell each other that winter is coming and that it is time to  sleep. Author Denise Fleming did a poor job of writing the story.  The  moral of the story, which is to go to sleep when it is bedtime, was weak.   She could have easily put in more detail and action and still get the same  point across. 	Even though the author did a bad job with lack of  excitement she did do a good job of describing the setting and what was  going on.  When snail is moving Fleming used the words " slowly  slithered", when she described how turtle moved, she used the words  " trudged up Woodchucks hill," and she used the words "  scritch and scratch" to describe how skunk was digging.  By using  these words the reader can picture how the animals were moving. Although  the writing was bad the illustrations were good.  The pictures are the only  thing that the book has going for it.  The illustrator did a great job of  showing detail and using bright colors. The leaves were bright and  different colors, just as they would be expected to be in the fall.  Good  detail was also used with the shape of the leaves, trees, animals, and each  animal's house. Some other good things about the book are that the print is  big, there are only a few sentence on each page, and there are not very  many big words.  These are good examples of why this book would be good for  kids who are learning how to read. Because there are not a lot of big  words, so kids would be able to understand what they are reading. 	  Time to Sleep would make a great bedtime story, because it would probably  bore kids to death.  This book would be a great story for kids to read, but  because of its lack of excitement it wouldn't be a very good book to read  to them. 								- Jessica Pac 
 Absolutely pathetic.  I held out hope right up through the last four pages, thinking somehow there would be something there at the end to make up for such a tortuous read.  Here's the deal - there is nothing here to care about - the writing (especially the dialogue), characters, and story all come in under the column-heading TRITE.  The comparisons with Margaret Atwood are unfounded.  Save yourself - this is a dud.  And, a wet one at that. 
 Don't get me wrong -- this is a great product; however, $27.97 for shipping from Amazom or $7.95 shipping from Office Depot. Whatsup with that?  Is Amazon tacking on a $20 handling fee?  I ordered directly from Office Depot and now it makes me wonder how many of my other purchases from Amazon were the same 
 I ordered this item as a gift and later learned that they had already received a like product. When I tried to return this unused item I was unable to get any response despite the fact that I followed all of the instructions for returns. This item is drop-shipped by wholesalersclub.com. After four phone calls and three emails, I have gotten no repsonse. No only am I upset with wholesalers.com, but with Amazon for subscribing to this kind of lousy service 
 I love the Stephanie Plum series but this was a dud. Normally I can finish one of the series in a day, but I couldn't even make it through half of this novella. I'm going to try again someday, but I'd say, just move on to the next book...You'll be much more satisfied 
 Have been a big fan of the BTB saga of Emma Hart.  The early ones were great--worth repeat reads.  With this one, I'd say the saga should end.  Hard to finish reading this book 
 The pillows are very soft, don't give any support to the neck. Not recommand it 
 The blurb writers and reviewers of this book must have been compensated because never have I been so disappointed in the advance word regarding a novel. Yes, the writing is poetic, but the story is aimless and the characters not defined.  In quantity and quality this is a very thin book 
 I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
 Of interest; the book's authors are throat and mouth specialists.  Also, they are not aware that their institution ( Johns Hopkins) is making great strides in SCI research.  that's a invaluable contact they neglected to study.  Bold predictions are made claiming that SCI will not be cured within several decades, 100 years etc.  Yet they tell the reader to move on with your life and still have hope for SCI therapies.  Here's the problem- they do the worst thing imaginable, they condescend to the patient, providing false hope, if they clain SCI treatments (valid ones) are hundreds years away, then why should patients stay hopeful if it will not help them or anybody with a SCI in our lifetimes?  These are serious claims from authors whose credentials do not include spinal cord injury 
 I read about one hundred pages and then, when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding, I quit. This was my first King book and I am not rushing out to buy another one, especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages.  Is it any wonder that it is selling on Amazon for a penny? Actually, I would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair 
 If you like unimaginative phony crap you'll love this book.  The proposed animals within this book are utterly stupid and improbable.  An antelope that feels through the snow with its incredibly dumb looking antlers?  A DIURNAL and TERRESTRIAL mammal that for some God-forsaken reason lacks eyes of any kind?  Primates that don't evolve to fit man's niche, but instead take on the roles of otters and flying squirrels?  The thing has got nonsense written all over it.  The "future animals" proposed for this book were not well thought out and somebody, please find Mr. Dixon a liguist, and FAST!  Some of the names he gives these future animals are so stupidly childish that they actually detract from a creature's plausibility.  A vortex? A posset?  What jerk scientist of the future is naming these things?  Can he please be institutionalized?  I admit the pictures were well done and pre-teen children would probably enjoy this immensely.  I know I would've when I was 10 or 11, and there's nothing wrong with that, it's just that Dougal Dixon begins the book in a very advanced scientific way discussing food pryramids, chains of evolution, and ecological niches, but then converts to unscientific baloney around page 30.  All in all, I just don't think it's cut out for people over the age of 12 or so, unless you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures.  But in that case, why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution?  Why not pick up a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual or something like that with lots of mythological and imaginary creatures?  I find that books intended to showcase the fantastic, do much better outside the realm of (somewhat-boring) science 
 The advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving, because it doesn't properly show it. From what I saw on the Amazon site, I thought the wallet will be much bigger.  Amazon doesn't give measurements of the product, and there are not enough pictures of the it. Basicly it isn't worth it to buy a product if I'm not sure of how it looks like.  Now I have a wallet that my husband does not want, and I can do nothing with it.  I feel that I wasted $25.00 
 We must be attained to truth in order to create a really universal brasilian literature; excuse me the prostitutes of the literary status quo, but Dom Casmurro is not a great book in order to be enlisted as a piece of the Weltliteratur as designed by Goethe. Under the look of millions of variables in level of superficial structure, this trivial narrative plays, in its profound stru cture, the ritual of the eternal victory of the richer over the poorest, maniqueistically, without any greater discussion, AB OVO. Machado de Assis, like other famous brasilian writer once said, was a "betrayer of the black people". Even being neger, Machado renegated his own race and mother - he let her real mother die in a Rio de Janeiro's favela without even visiting her - just to try a place on the short and elitist literary circle of his time. Machado de Assis may have his positive points as brasilian writer, but he is not compared to the thumbnails of Shakespeare or Cervantes, who he tries to mimic on Dom Casmurro. Machado de Assis is considered the greatest writer of Brasil just because he well served (and is still useful) to the interests of the oligarchy and richer elite of our country, Dom Casmurro is but a lie blinded claped by critics sodomized by the political orders of a retrograted state, these claps are blindly followed by we, the people, who is not incentivated to really try really great books. This critic of mine is not the only one, I invite you to read the books of Doctor Flvio Kothe, whose critics are more detailed and also studies the social-economic status of Machado's time; The opinions of Dr. Kothe are academic and well observed, and recognized, a proof of this assertion is that he is winner of important prizes, included one for the translation for german to portuguese of the book "Das Parfum", of Sussekind.

 Absolutely useless.  The three gizmos are in three small adjoining areas -  Kitchen / Breakfast / Office areas.  The roaches come out at night and do a little dance to the "clicks" that the gizmos emit.  No effect whatsoever after 3 months 
 I have a lot of John Prine music and I've loved seeing him in concert many times.  That said, I really don't have a lot of interest in a CD where the artist has run out of ideas and essentially re-works his older material.  This might not be what other Prine fans want to hear, but just because I am glad he's seemingly beaten cancer, I am not going to praise this weaker piece of work.  I would have liked to have heard something from John Prine which didn't sound like a song he'd previously released.  I've already got his old music and to be asked to pay for a slightly re-worked version under the guise of new music doesn't cut it with me.  On the other hand, if you're new to John Prine, you can buy either this or his older music and you'll probably be happy.  Hopefully Prine will return to creating new music and not just marketing his older work in a new package 
 If you are looking for a book to read about poker, pass on this one unless you are desperate for any poker read.  Do so for a very simple reason:  there is surprisingly little about poker in this 'poker book'.    There is a detailed account of Ted Binion's murder which courses through the book.  In fact there is much more about Binion than about poker.  But this book was not found in the mystery section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  Or you might like some insight about going to a jewelry store to pick out an anniversary ring for your wife.  This is covered in more detail than McManus' coverage of his WSOP satellite tournaments.  In fact, the author's wife Jennifer's ring size is six, a fact which for some reason I can't get out of my head.  But the book was not in the weddings/anniversaries section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  Are you curious about McManus' childhood, his parents and grandparents?  Then this is the book for you, although it would usually be found in the autobiography section.  There is even a fascinating, endless chapter on whether A. Alvarez should have had intercourse with Sylvia Plath, and whether such coitus would have interrupted her eventual suicide (our  author thinks not, but we all know it depends).  But this book was not in the self-help-for-sick-poets section of the bookstore; it was in the poker section.  In all seriousness, I could go on and on with examples such as these.  It's not a bad book; in fact the sections on poker are really quite good.  If the author had edited out three quarters of the book, I would give it five stars.  When I go to the poker section of the bookstore and buy a book about poker, I want my goddess poker to be the topic.    If you're looking for one person's experience with poker, mostly but not exclusively in Vegas, read Anthony Holden's "Big Deal".  It's a great read, and it's even about poker.   
 Sean Hannity is a joke, all of these pundits are. WE should dig a hole and push them all in, then throw in a few starving tigers. That would roc 
 The author missed the point of a quiet life which is that you just do it and enjoy it --- you don't call your friends to do it with you and stop when they cancel.  Another reviewer of Bender's work said that she in "in her head too much" and I completely agree. Stop thinking SO much - just enjoy life - your family. Stop making lists. Stop degrading yourself for the simple process of taking care of yourself, your family and your house. 
 I thought this book was going to be a great Legal Thriller, but little did I know that it would turn out to be the worst book I have ever read. I expected a lot more out of Scott Turow, who wrote "One L", which I loved, but this book was plan boring. The begining started out slow and it never picked up from there! The worst Legal Thriller, ever 
 this thing doesn't work, nothing but black and white image and off center.  my video card is ntsc like it said but won't work on the 3 computers i have.  don't buy this, buy a video converter box 
 I gave it a chance and not suprisingly I was thoroughly sickened. This is one of the latest in a crop of Hip Hop crime dramas featuring the same horrible rappers that fuel the ... soundtracks in the acting roles. This movie left a foul taste in my mouth and quite a headache. This is further proof that Rap is ruining all forms of entertainment. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this incorrigible trash.

 An interesting story but only an average read. Jumping from one author to another is distracting. There are many other books written about women doing remarkable journeys that make a better read an deserve attention 
 This book is for the beginner and offers no information that cannot be found (for free) on other internet sites. It appears as if the author has written this book to make his methodology clearer to himself and in the process decided to sell it as a book. No earth shattering revelations to be found and definately not enough good quality examples.   A bit disappointed in the content but this book will be a good read for an absolute newbie in the field.  
 I picked up this book hoping for a good sci-fi/mystery read along the lines of Crichton or Preston/Child.  However, I found myself quickly put off by the very weak and unbelievable "science" that the book is based upon.   Now, I understand that much sci-fi deviates from actual science, but the ideas about cloning presented in this book are just too horrible to take seriously.  The idea that clones "hatch" at about 25 years old in a few weeks, or that clones come complete with all of the memories that the source organism had prior to being sampled, is just bad science, and not even believable enough for a sci-fi read.  Perhaps this would not have been so bad if the historical and biblical research (NOTE: I do not consider this a religious novel) did not seem so much more complete, or if it was set in a more futuristic or fantastic world.  But it is fairly well researched, and set in a modern or near-future timeline at a real national laboratory.  It is this sort of novel that engenders misconceptions about modern genetic science and leads to the sort of conservative/religious objections to the beneficial research being done in this area.  Overall, not a terrible book.  I did finish it and it kept me entertained much of the time, but I am left feeling a little uneasy after having finished 
 this movie is terrible. so pretentious that would make the skin on your skull unbearably itchy. wasted a lot of money on scene settings, costumes, manpower, make-ups...but failed to have a tight but a loose and absurd screenplay, so horrible and so boring and so ridiculous. my wife and i both agreed that if this movie could be directed by a better director in addition to a better screenplay written by a real talented screenplay writer, it could be a great movie, not just skin deep shallow cosmetic visual beauty. all the great ingredients were there, but shamefully wasted by both of the script writer and the director who spent too much and only focus on the visual effects and the luxurious scene settings. every frame of this film is beautiful, but besides that, what else deserves a positive praise? zhang ziyi's performance was also restricted and ruined by this terrible script and failed to deliver a recommendable praise. if even she failed, you could imagine how others failed more miserably. the dialog, my god, is the worst ever! tried so hard to be deep and poetical, but only made us sick and nauseous and wanted to puke when those pretentious words and sentences were spoken by those characters.  i want to repeat again that the dialog is really the worst ever! sometimes in ancient language(wuen yien wuen, goo wuen), sometimes in modern chinese (bai hua, modern day chinese common way of talk); let's put this way: it's just like shakespea's plays randomly mixed with modern day rap or hip-hop english, part of them are still ancient english theater dialog, but between the lines inserted modern day english, most of the sentences delivered by zhang ziyi are all in modern chinese, but other people talked to her are all in ancient chinese. isn't that funny?  the sound track is also a buffet of random mixture. too modern, too western, mixed with chinese gong and drum, knockings and bangings at the same time, a very funny mixture without any sequence and integrity similar to the dialog.  all the the fighting scenes are also very pretentious, only  performed like staged dancings, having the forms but no spirit at all. the screenplay is so bad that we have to force ourselves sit tight but very impatient. the tempo of this movie is also terribly slow, slow like snail crawling. but this movie can be still used to test your patience when you watch a pretentious and slow movie.  
 To be quite honest about this book, I did not finish reading it, even though it was well written. It's a case of mistaken identity: about halfway through it was evident that Brooke Medicine Eagle is preaching New Age  religion and is not holding to traditional practices and beliefs, as I  hoped when I bought this book. At the point where she was explaining how  she believes that Christianity and Traditional beliefs are consitent with  each other, I quit reading and merely skimmed, finding that this book is a  conglomeration of different beliefs, including 12-step programs. Perhaps  this is what a reader may be looking for; this reader was not. Those  looking for Traditional reading might wish to read Sacred Fireplace, by  Pete S. Catches, Sr., or Crow Dog, by Leonard Crow Dog and Richard Erdoes,  both of which are filled with traditional spiritual insight and practice 
 I love Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone books and have been reading them for years. But "Cape Perdido" was so bad I couldn't get through it. The characters are all stereotypes-- the aggressive, unfeminine local tree-hugger lady; the arrogant, chauvanistic, big-city lawyer; the sweet, idealistic community liaison intern; etc., etc. The only mystery was some oft-referenced, vague, long-ago "incident" that was never explained (at least not in the first 110 pages, which is where I got off the bus.) I don't know who wrote this book but I hope it wasn't REALLY Marcia Muller. I don't want to believe she would knowlingly publish such poor writing 
 This book is devoid of any substance. I am a well-known, highly respected market technician and capable of discerning value and substance and utter nonsense. This book is the latter for sure. It is a marketing ploy and this woman should be ashamed of herself. I am a proud member of the Market Technicians Association. I share my ideas and vast knowledge and experience with others free of charge. I devote my spare time to reading books on technical analysis but I do not want to waste my time. Had this book been wothout type I would have been happier as I would not have wasted my valuable time. It is a total disgrace! I have a very successful full time real estate job and my time is certainly more valuable obvioujsly than this young lady. Buyer beware! Thank goodness I could return this empty attempt at marketing. I am even attempted to write a book and demonstrate how an honest person presents true value 
 I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel.  The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller.  Don't waste your time.  
 I would not recommend this book for a little kid.  I've got two 3 year old girls and it's way too loud and way too grown-up for little kids.  I don't think it's appropriate. We have Philadelphia Chickens too and I would rate that a 5 star.  That one is inspiring.  This one is like letting your kid watch Saturday Night Live 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 It gave me a headache. I found nothing enlightening about it. I subscribe to the belief that in truth there is beauty and simplicity. In science it can be a simple formula expressing a profound idea such as E=mc^2. I guess it's a great academic exercise for those who have the time. Where's the clarity. I subscribe the KISS concept. Life/being at least in the physical sense appears very short from where I'm sitting. I'd rather embrace life with joy and whatever form my being has taken and savor the time I have. That to me has real meaning. To each his/her own we will probably never know if we got it "right" or  will MH. Or perhaps he finally did 
 You know how some books create characters and a world you love so much, you try to read slower because you don't want the book to end?  This is not one of those books.  I'm a fairly fast reader so I always finish any book I start.  I have never regretted this policy more than now.  I am three quarters of the way through this book and the end can't some soon enough for me.  The best part of the book was the lengthy "Acknowledgement".  The author seems to be a nice person and I feel bad panning her book but if I can save anyone the misery I'm in, I have to do it.  If you want vampire/romance, read the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton 
 Eleanor Roosevelt is truly a fascinating character, but this book is absolutely painful to read.  Cook makes references to topics before addressing them, makes characters difficult to follow, and generally botches what could be a great subject.  Look elsewhere for Eleanor Roosevelt 
 I used to respect Mr. Butler's work. I was a big fan of "Good Scent" and especially of "They Whisper." But this is yet another superficial, lightweight offering. It makes me sad to see a once-great author sinking to such depths. Anyone interested should go back and read the old works. They had some real magic to them. The last few books are all just dead weight, a finished author plowing ahead simply because he's expected to. I wish I could say something more nuanced and objective. But this is just a depressing last straw. I am finished with Mr. Butler from here on in. 
 As curious as I was about this movie it had me dazed. The 'Good Shepherd' always struck me symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid. With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, "The Good Shepherd" tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours. The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that's miss you won't get it. This is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot.  This movie is told from Damon's point of view, its scope is epic, and covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace. Angelina Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she' get into character very well. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.   Robert de Niro (got to love him), in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity; if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is the executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is a little tweaking. 
 As a professor of leadership myself, I am struck by how this book perpetuates stereotypes.   The first stereotype is about the role of women. The wives in the book are nothing more than interchangable helpmates who provide nice homes and emotional support. I suspect that during the editing process it was suggested that the women be assigned degrees and "jobettes"...but even so, it is clearly the men who make thing happen and who sit and ponder the Great Ideas for the book's conclusions. The women are supporting characters, and reinforce the stereotype that leadership is a game for men.   A similar stereotype exists about the nature of jobs. In the book it is the business person who lets his job pressures and focus on the bottom line get the better of him. This same scenario has been played out time and time again in discussing the work/life balance to the point of it being a cliche.   In addition, the main characters seem to perpetuate a stereotype of a "dominant culture" in which the world is full of happily married white-collar suburban couples (who I would bet are Caucasian), with husbands who play golf, and who have the cash to buy vacation homes.   When combined with the Christian perspective, one is left to wonder whether Christianity is solely relevant to these stereotypes of people. I would have hoped for broader thinking from authors with such credentials. 
 I live in the Wash. DC area and we have pretty bad traffic.  I normally take a route that isn't extremely bad but does has congestion.  I get no warnings at all.  Also, recently there was a smaller side road (Non-Highway but well used road) that was closed on both directions but had no information on this road.  The antenna works but Clear Channels Traffic information sucks.  Sucks really bad.  When I check the traffic information, the only information I get is the main large interstate highways.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.    Who knows, maybe the XM traffic service is better but I can honestly tell you Clear Channel Traffic Service SUCKS!  Maybe I'll get some traffic information traveling on I-95 somewhere...  Sorry for the unproffesionalism but its the honest truth 
 This book is a book written as a "formula" book. It has several outright inaccuracies as has been previously cited. Hawke was given the first F35 to buzz around in? Riiiightt! Come on that plane wouldn't have been allowed to be photographed much less flown by a rouge guy like Hawke. What was the point of the F35 Flight in any case?   An anti gravity train? Is this Science Fiction?  Another case was when Jet was about to be set upon by a frothing at the mouth Doberman, Jet says release the dog. It turns out the dog was a long lost pet of hers named Blondi. Riigghtt! A pet does not show fangs and froth at the mouth.   I believe several parts of this book were just stuck in for filler.   To often someone shows up miraculously just at the right time to save the day.  There is a great lack of creditability in this writing.  
 There is a saying that Hawkins apparently has no knowledge of.     "If you wish to know where the sparrow flies... ask the sparrow."    Most of the mis-information in this book is the same old tired arguements against Wicca and Paganism that have been regurgitated for years by Christians. Most of Hawkin's arguements are meaningless to anyone who is not already a Christian. These arguements are presented as if the precepts of Christianity were proven "truth", and any other religious concepts are therefore false. What Hawkins fails to recognise is that the Christian precepts he uses are not proven, and indeed cannot be shown to be more valid that the religions he decrys, thus his arguements are flawed from the outset. Wiccans , and adherants of any other religion for that matter, can easily recognise this type of fallacy, and so anyone trying to use the "truth" of Christianity to disprove Wicca will be simply dismissed from the outset.    This book is simply a tool to make Christians feel better about themselves, while demonising another religion. If you think you can use this book to "save" your children or friend from Wicca... then you are probably the reason they rejected Christianity in the first place 
 This is a little far fetched but bare with, a London born Actress transplants herself to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap...and then writes about a London born Actress being transplanted  to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap. Got it? Personally this psuedo semiautobiographical novel about Hughes life (or lack there of) is testament that some actors should remain just that! The cynical nature in which her character sees Los Angles and the people surrounding her is way too close to accurate for this to be classified as true "fiction" and the parallels between her main "villain" Meredith Contini and a certain fabulous legendary New York Based All My Children icon is so blatant it borders on insulting. Her work on General Hospital was good, Her work on All My Children was tolerable, at best, but her work as a writer makes me ashamed to admit Finola Hughes is a fellow Brit. 
 I live in the ghetto(because the darkest blacks live there), am insecure about my nappy hair, will not climb the corporate ladder as swiftly as my light skinned peers, when choosing a mate I will desire a light skinned husband so that I can dip into a lighter gene pool, and finally, if I had to adopt a child I would REQUEST a light skinned one quicker than a dark one.  Slave talk, all of it!  I read this book (most of it) with a completely open mind and hoping for a well researched and fair study of black america's color complex. I ended up throwing this book across the room in frustration. This book perpetuates the myth more than black america. As a dark skinned female I felt horrible reading this, mothers don't let your babies read this, it can be SERIOUSLY detremental to ones development. In all honesty I can say with much authority (after all I have been black all of my life) that the very vast majority of black people do NOT think like this. I find it very hard to believe that it's no more than a coincidence that the authors are the two who benefit the most from the "color complex", a light skinned female and a dark male (because according to this book light skinned men lack the all important street credibility and dark skinned women are bitter and unattractive).  This is a disgraceful portrayal of what could have been a pivotal cultural study. Shame on them for perpetuating the myth 
 This product did not cut any nose hair at all.  I am not exaggerating to say NONE.  I also bought a conair one and it was equally useless.  I gave it one star instead of zero because it offers a 30 day money back guarentee and can be returned to the point of purchase.   Also you can not use rechargable batteries in this unit only alkaline. There are no directions to this unit.  Under directions it only gives information on how to install a battery 
 From the first time I read Downard's article in the cryptic anti-Masonic symbol inspired rant, "King-Kill 33" in "Apocalypse Culture" from that always challenging publisher Feral House, may Adam Parfrey's tribe increase.  I have anxiously awaited the release of Downard's auto-biography (or hagiography?) "Carnivals of Life & Death".  I was hoping for I admit a exposition of the nefarious cryptocracy littering the American landscape a la Downard.  Perhaps in the same vein as Jim Brandon's "Rebirth of Pan". What I found instead upon entering Mr. Downard's tacky carnival was a memoir of paranoia as lifestyle coupled with insights into an active Oedipal complex (he just can't say "NO" to his monster Mother), (wait there's still more) and the most jaw dropping violence comitted by little James as a child that would make most Sam Peckinpah movies pale by comparison.  His feeding of a wounded bad guy to an anaconda in a sewer during a fast getaway scene was my personal favorite escapade.  Discover how as a mere child, Mr. Downard fought off the entire goon squad of Ku Klux Klaner's and Freemasons in Ardmore, Oklahoma and became the most hated kid in Amerika. Like a car wreck I kept staring at this book and flipping pages.  Several times I wanted to sail it across the room in a fit of ennui, but fought off the lassitude by incredulity.  That is until Mr. Downard invokes the historical reality of Diana Vaughn!  Diana Vaughn was an imaginary 19th century victim of Masonic abuse invented by the French journalist Leo Taxil as an example of human gullibility in the face of conspiratorial thinking.  The French Catholic community was really pissed off once Taxil revealed the sham. That said, this is the best paranoic writing on the market today.  For those seeking more "King-Kill 33" type of investigation you will be sadly disappointed.  Mark Twain once described the "Book of Mormon" as "chloroform in print", this work will make you only slighty disoriented.  Dis-oriented...the Masonic Grand Orient...maybe I am part of the Masonic mind control agenda...?            
 All the while I was reading this book, it was very apparent to me that Edwards' objection to reincarnation seems to be based on-dare I say this dirty word-dogmatism. He presupposes that reincarnation cannot possibly be  true, according to the precepts of materialism, and presents a series of  arguments and non-arguments to that effect. While clearly a very  intelligent man, Edwards seems to be thinking and arguing on a different  "plane." For instance, he attempts to disprove the existence of  God in his "Irreverent Postscript." While myself an atheist, I  doubt any believer in God would be fazed by the arguments therein, simply  because Edwards is thinking in completely different terms than those with  whom he is attempting to argue. In short, you will enjoy this book if you  are determined not to believe in reincarnation. Otherwise, I don't think  you'll be impressed 
 I really hope people will read the real Koran and not this politically correct white wash!   The real Koran is FILLED with threats, cursings, and just plain hatred towards disbelievers (= non muslims).  In fact, that is a majority of Koranic contents!   The  Surahs of violent threats and curses (against disbelievers) are written out in every chapter of the Koran.  Repeatedly!! Any fair minded reader would conclude that the Koran is a book of hatred towards Jews, Christians, or non muslims in general.  The Koran TEACHES people to kill non muslims.  That is not hatred??   How can this 'dummy' book ignore all that??  I am usually a fan of 'Dummies' book.  But unfortunately this is not an accurate overview of the Koran. 
 This is a cleverly conceived novel with some amusing moments but ultimately dissatisfying.  A novel about trying to find a stolen treasure (Marie Antoinette's clock) - could be a good yarn but notice there are 60 chapters like the 60 minutes on the clock face and you'll start to see that this book is trying to be clever. The characters are unbelievable, the plot unbelievable; but it is clever and we can have a few chuckles at the anally retentive librarian protagonist's predicament - but that is all you get 
 Artie may well be a baby gorilla, but the film sucks 
 I would like to write a favorable review of this book, but I honestly can't.  You see, I am a Nebraskan and my father knew the Sandoz family growing up in western Nebraska. However, this is a hard book to read and at times, as dull and lifeless as the Nebraska prarie that Ms Sandoz describes.  For someone looking to learn more about western Nebraska during the late 1800's to early 1900's I suggest picking up a Willa Cather novel 
 If you're familiar with Gerald May, you know he's spent the past couple of decades searching through the world's different spiritualities to find "authenticity" for life, so it's not surprising he's finally stumbled upon Catholic mystics. And it's also not surprising that he's worked hard to recast John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila in his own image, removing the most important aspects of their lives, which is Jesus crucified (he's called "John of the Cross" for a reason, you know).  This is not a book that portrays these two mystics accurately, nor does it put forth any form of orthodox Christianity, but is just one of the many dumbed down versions of New Age Christianity out there claiming that "God is nada, no-thing" (page 179) and that John of the Cross was not seeking "any specific image of God" for "It is neither the name (God, Allah, or Krishna) or the man (Jesus or Buddha) that is the final object of [man's] loving desire." (ibid)  And he concludes with the unhelpful advice "that's the devil of it; there is no way to know for sure. All we can do is hope for the dawn." In reality, John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila both knew for sure, even in their darkest nights - they couldn't see it, they couldn't experience it, they couldn't feel it, but they knew, and in faith continued on anyway.  Anyone really interested in these two saints' thoughts and experiences would be better off getting the Kavanaugh or the Peers translations of their works (available for free online or in cheap paperback editions) and working through them personally. 
 The contents and materials are not exactly what I've been looking for from this book. It seems a bit out-dated, especially in this fast-evolving digial age 
      Three kids whose parents have abandoned them are put at a place called Whitegates.  They escape and go down river to the worst place you could ever imagine.  This is where they meet the grateful Heaven Eye's.  They also met heaven Eye's grandpa who is a little weird and scary. The scariest things happen in the Black Middens.  They have to try and find out the mystery of the Black Middens, Heaven Eye's, and grandpa      The dislikes I had about the book was every time someone had said something David would write he said, she said.  He would never replace said with yelled or screamed or anything.  I didn't really like the end of the book that much.  I thought the book was a little pointless.  The ending didn't really have a reason behind it.      I would recommend this book to people who are into books about people getting stuck somewhere.  Also I would recommend this book to people who look at the positives in life.  
 How is it possible that the Molly Maguires could be made boring!  It's about real life and real people! History is exciting. This book is a cold and lifeless list-the way many of us were taught history in school. I  wanted to learn about the Molly Maguires but this book was a disaster. The  print was very small-get a magnifying glass-I'm serious.Were I taking a  course in school and this was one of the textbooks and I had a decent  professor then thats ok. This reads like some long boring detailed  document.There should be some sort of warning. I'm not blaming any one but  somewhere there should be an explanation about not just if a given reader  liked a book but what kind of book it is 
 It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her 
 If Disney ever wanted to make the argument that they have not lost touch with their childhood roots, I would strongly suggest not mentioning Snow Dogs in that argument.  Sure, the numbers showed that this film was a success (i.e. the budget was $35 million and it took in $81 million in the US alone), but the final product that was released to the screen was nothing but sheer drivel.  From the unoriginal story, to the inconsistent characters, to the painful acting of Cuba Gooding, Jr., Snow Dogs proved two truths.  The first is that Disney can successfully make and mass-produce B-level cinema.  The second is that they can make Oscar-winning actors give the worst performances of their careers.  Snow Dogs demonstrates fully that some people in Hollywood choose money over scripts, they choose flimsy over developed, and recycled over original.  What upset me the most about this film was the use of CGI to exaggerate the dog's expressions.  To me, that is a huge slap in Cuba Gooding, Jr's face.  If the studio didn't think that Cuba could successfully make the audiences laugh, then they needed to get stronger talent, do not muddle the genre with CGI created eyes, mouths, and expressions on the dogs.  With this CGI, I felt as if I was watching a quick fix to an already unfixable problem.  Did I go into this film expecting greatness?  Not in any way shape or form.  What I did expect was a level of professionalism topped with some brilliant "something" to make me utterly aware that this was a Disney film and while they may have a bad film on their hands, at least they may throw money to fix the problem.  Again, my expectations were demolished.  It became very obvious as I watched this film that half of the scenes were in front of a green screen, not actually in Alaska.  Some of the more emotional moments were completely ruined by the horrid special effects in place.  Disney has the money, where did the $35 million dollar budget go?  From the CGI created dog "faces" to the CGI trees, bears, and mountains, you never felt like you were in Alaska at all, but instead warmly comfortable inside an obvious soundstage.  Pay up Disney, you cheated me on this one...  For this to be a full review, I have to mention the acting.  It pains me to do so because nobody, I repeat, NOBODY could muster any form of "reality" to this film.  From the delivery of the lines, the horrid physical comedy (which never worked), to the random moment of romance, not one character in this movie stayed in character or gave us any semblance of an actual character.  I watched an hour and a half of actors awkwardly demonstrating to us that they did not know their characters, that they did not know their lines, and that the paycheck at the end was more important than the work throughout the process.  I place solely the blame on Cuba Gooding, Jr.  What happened to him?  From the opening scene in Miami to the ending embarrassing "catch-phrase", I felt like Cuba should have handed the Academy back the award and apologized to everyone profusely.  There are lines in Snow Dogs that were obviously read from a cue card.  There were moments when it was obvious Cuba didn't care.  He showed no range of emotion, no rational credibility, and again, there was no character.  Who was Cuba Gooding, Jr. in this film?  Just like a Tootsie Roll Pop, the world may never know!  I could easily, and sadly, say the same about James Coburn.  He was awarded an Oscar as well and the best he can manage is Snow Dogs?  Who was Thunder Jack?  What was his story, what made him gruff, what ... what ... what ... just too many questions running through my mind with these key actors that it makes me feel sorry for the child audience this film was aimed towards.  It was very clear that neither of these actors were passionate about the story for they would have stopped early and backed away.  I would have thought that Cuba (or at least James Coburn) would have put their hands down when it was discovered that SISQO (Mr. Thong himself) was going to be a key player.  Unbelievable is the level of lacking respect that both of these actors had for themselves.  The proof is in Snow Dogs.  What bothered me the most about this film was the lack of intelligence aimed towards children.  This was a "family" film, yet racism seemed to be slapped directly in your face.  There was a scene that sticks out in my mind when Gooding tries to find his real father and assumes that it can only be the other black man in town.  When it is discovered that it is someone else, there is a shock in the community.  This film was released in 2002, with the society that we live in why would this be such a shock to the system?  Couple this with the fact that Michael Bolton brings us the "inspirational" line from the film, "It doesn't matter what color you are, everyone can have soul."  Egh.  Where did this come from, and is this a "good" message to send to children?  This ranks right next to the feeling that Gooding's love-interest was the only woman within a 100-mile radius, and that those living in Alaska are grizzly men with bad teeth.  I felt midway through this film that Disney executives were in their offices insisting on another Cool Runnings-esque film (there was even a Volkswagen moment in this one).  Sadly, with Snow Dogs their request became a nightmare.  Overall, this was a cheap film, which boasts Oscar-winners performing well below the bar, CGI dogs and background, a story that hinges on the edge of fantasy, and the quintessential Disney "bow of approval".  What I mean by this is that anything can happen, and with Disney films, it will.  Gooding has the finances to leave his dental practice for several weeks without worrying about missing work, he can learn how to dogsled within a couple days, saves a man's life, and he immediately falls in love with the only girl from town who happens to be a model in her spare time.  For those looking for a cute and cuddly film about dogs, I would not suggest this garbage.  It is predictable, pretentious, and pathetic.  Maybe a six-year old wouldn't mind the three "p", but this critic hated it!  Grade: * out of **** 
 The subject of the is book is very interesting, so I struggled through to the end (with plenty of skimming), but this guy can't tell a story.  Too dry, too long, no sense of style.  Tayloe Nicke 
 I went into reading this book with the highest of expectations both because of the other reviews on it and because I am really interested in the topic.  It started out interestingly enough but quickly went downhill. The first few case studies were pretty in depth and interesting but towards the middle of the book they got really short and shallow. It is almost as if the writer became impatient with his own book. If you don't want to write in detail about 100 brands then just don't. Write in depth about a handful but make the case studies meaningful. The subtopics were also not logical for me. For me a better format would have been: Chapter one / Lesson one: Research your market. Then give some examples of brands that failed to do so. Chapter two / lesson two: Kill the product not the brand. Then some examples. And so on. But it was not arranged like that. In fact none of the lessons seemed to tie together that well. Surely the author could have found some more logical groupings. Overall I give the book two stars 
 The actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking. The story is too unbelievable too. It was a waste of my money to buy it. 
 Busy with a project of my own (Author of "Warrior of the Three Moons") I have finally found time to catch up on both the SoT and the WOT series. Now having worked my way through Book 8 of SoT and Book 9 of WoT, I am determined to end my own series in 5, possibly 6, books.   Ok about "Naked Empire." I enjoyed the parts with Zedd and Nathan and Chase. And it was good that Adie was back in the story. Those vibrant charaters basically saved the book. Having said that, the book could have easily been reduced by 200 - 250 pages. All authors, myself included, tend to inject our life phlosophies into our stories. Unfortunately, TG went overboard in Naked Empire. I found myself skipping over Richard's pedantic preaching. Hopefully TG will rediscover his story-telling abilities in Book 9.  
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 Waste of money if you are not into the girl- girl thing- nearly every story has it.  And the ones that don't are worse.  terrible.  Bad writing 
 Unless you like ultra modern home designs, skip this book. The plans are impractical, especially with respect to kitchen layouts. Most of the homes have no vestibules in their entrances, which are a neccessity in colder climates 
 After finishing this book I have decided to write my shortest review ever for Amazon. I have two reasons for doing this:  1) There is not much I can say that probably hasn't been said by 2,408 other reviewers  2) Maybe Robert Jordan will follow my example and learn to be more concise with his next installment in this series  As has been stated this book could be sub-title "Much Ado about Nothing" with apologies to Shakespeare. The descriptions are incredibly over long (I have sympathy for the reviewer who had to actually LISTEN to all this.) and almost nothing is resolved in this novel. My only hope is that Jordan has managed to set the stage for the next installment in this series and according to his website he is intending to finish this series in the immediate future. I would only recommend this book if you are a devout fan of the series and intend on following it to its' conclusion. However if you do not want to labor through the 822 pages, just read the reviews here on Amazon and you will find all the events that take place in this novel described in a much more concise version without all the extraneous narrative 
 all they do is take every suffix and play the alphabet game, just running down the list, there are no complex rhymes half of common words are left out 
 Good-but not very relastic Dixion really should have bothered to look at the state of the world in the last 65 million years, because their are events that would still have happened. For example, birds would not have become extinct, neither would the mammals, both were doing very well. Also, the Pterosaurs would be extinct, or close to it 
 I wonder how accurate the rest of the book is when the author, Mr. Kershaw, did not care to notice that Dawson City, the Klondike, and surrounding region are not in Alaska but well inside Canada. He makes these erroneous references often 
 What exactly is it that Ms Wearstler does? This book is filled with "glam" pictures of recycled design ideas by Billy Haines,Dorothy Draper and Billy Baldwin,mostly of the "Hollywood Regency" style. Ms Wearstler,whose home it is, appears in the photos dressed to the nines and seems to want us to think that she dreamed up this nifty new look.  Take a look at the new Billy Haines book and the just released book on Dorothy Draper and you'll see real designers at work AND whose work and style this really is. 
 I have never seen a book in my life that was so badly written.  They refer to Jack as "Jake" and even "Nack", have mismatched verb tenses, forget to finish sentences.  I don't think there was a single page without an error on it.  Each chapter starts with a plot synopsis that is basically the same as you can read on a million web sites.  That's followed by a few quotes, a theory from the fans - again which you can find everywhere online, a "Sawyerism" - which is a list of nicknames he uses for other characters in that episode, and then the "Seven Degrees of Lost" which reminds us of really important things like "Rose and Jack sat next to each other on the plane".  Really not worth the $, or the time to flip through the pages.  
 The first thing that came to my so called mind after the completion of this film was, "What was Terry Zwigoff thinking?"  He is responsible for the documentary of Robert Crumb entitled `Crumb', which was one of the better films made in the last two decades.  `Bad Santa' was a very big surprise as well, so I am caught scratching my head as to why he decided this particular script and/or subject matter was worth making a feature presentation over.  For starters, people who are serious artists and who over-emphasize the importance of their craft are the most annoying people on the planet.  I can say that because I went through a department with this type of person.  They are self indulged and think so highly of what they're trying to say that it irritates me just thinking about it.  The fact is...they have nothing to say and what they are doing has very little significance to people who actually have talent (ie, those of us who don't need to "say" anything).  If Zwigoff focused on this and made a mockery of the entire `art-scene', that might be enough to make a entertaining film, but there isn't enough in here, really.  `Art School Confidential' gets too boggled down in a courtship where the main kid seemingly finds his first infatuation in a figure model at school.  The two of them are so uninteresting that it made me yearn for some art school-critique talk from some of the hippies in the film.  It tried too hard to go over the top with some of it's jokes (male models walking up to female students where her eye level is at his pelvis level, the obnoxious roommate who offers nothing but `can I smell your finger' quirks).  It would have been nice if the story actually followed this student, who knew he was better than everyone else (and he was), ridicule the rest of the students who had absolutely nothing to offer the world (which is, essentially, about 98% of all "artists").  Instead it turns into your standard, boy tries to impress girl by stealing someone else's artwork who just happens to be a serial killer story.  Wrong direction.  There are/were too many opportunities to make fun of these types passed up for something that's been overdone way too many times.  Terry should have known better!  There is a very entertaining Thanksgiving Dinner scene, which was worth two stars from me.  The overbearing female who takes her artwork way too seriously even though it's complete trash was also amusing, so that earns two stars.  Just not enough irritating art-scene comedy in here to recommend it at all 
 After "Lazarus Long" I had high expectations for this audio book.  It seems, however, that Heinlein "lost it" between 1946 and 1961!  The book starts out interestingly enough but once VMS goes out on his own, it becomes a joke!  Heinlein's endless anti-religion, diatribes, voiced through the mouths of VMS and the insufferable "Jubal Hershaw" made me want to chew my leg off, just to get away!  (Apologies to "Hitchiker's Guide!")  I stuck it out though, hoping for a "second wind," but there was no wind, just a SUCKING sound! Jubal is basically Marvin the Robot on downers! Any real person with his outlook would've eaten a gun LONG ago.  VMS is an "Ubermench" strung out on Qualludes!  "I grock this...I grock that...I grock grocking..." Blah Blah Blah.  I didn't grock this book at all! The final scene wherein VMS allows himself to be vivisected reminded me of the "Black Knight" scene from Monty Python's "Holy Grail"..."It's only a flesh wound!" Oh, and lastly, what's with Foster and Digby and VMS himself in some sort of weird afterlife "adjusting their halos!?"  Methinks Heinlein may have discovered Acid in his later life. Bottom line, a waste of 16 hours of my time...thank God (yes, THAT God!) I didn't have to pay for it 
 I bought this book thinking it would help me get to know my husband and friends better, but in the end, it's just a silly book with questions anyone could think up.  Basically, the book is laid out in the following manner:  It will as a question like:  Would you do something like...eat a bug, kill a bug, or something like that.  Then the book posits another question following that which goes something like this...What if eating or killing the bug would save someone's life?  What if it would save your life?  What if it would end world hunger?  Then it asks the ~~ULTIMATE~~ question...Would you still eat or kill the bug if it were a cockroach and if it were poison???  What if it were a butterfly???  Each set of questions is essentially laid out in the same way.  After I'd gone through about 5 sets of questions the only question I had left was why I'd bought the book 
 Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious.  Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book.  I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was "forced" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug.  This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't.   I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so.  Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any.    
 I don't understand the motivation of authors that claim the USS Liberty attack was anything but accidental. Sure they'll get some sales from the neo-Nazi conspiracy nuts, but isn't being honest more important?  In short this book still can't answer the $64,000 question of why ISrael would purposely attack their ONLY ally in 1967.  If this friendly fire incident were something else, the US would not have begun giving military aid to Israel, (they started this policy in 1968) Israel and the United States are 2 of a kind, they have the courage to fight terrorism, and this book is simply making up a conspiracy that never happened.  Don't quit your day job Anthony Pearson, whatever it is 
 A story told first time can be fasicnating. As Rocket Boys was. The same story told second time is just boring. The first one had a backbone: boys trying to achieve the goal despite the circumstances. The second one - ranomly selected stories about this or that - I simply don't care. Meaningless and borin 
 I wouldn't waste your money. I am only on chapter 2 and the mistakes in here are stacking up. Spelling mistakes, incorrect information and questions that say to pick an answer from a to g with the correct answer being h make it far from the ideal book to build your confidence or knowledge.  
 Another reviewer said it perfectly - this book is overrated, and that's being kind.  The purported "twist" at the end - you'd have to be blind & imbecilic not to see it coming.  Even though the "twist" isn't explicitly spelled out at the end, it's fairly obvious.    I listened to the audio version of it, and while all 3 main narrators were great, I had to fast forward much of it when Ralph Trilipush was the narrator - the incessant droning on and on and on got to be very tedious.    In the beginning, I liked all the characters but Ralph, Ferrell seemed nice, and Margaret seemed OK too.  It annoyed me that the main (titular) character seemed to have no redeeming qualities - he was arrogant, condescending, and altogether disagreeable.  By the end, all 3 main characters devolved into unlikable, although the reason we come not to like Ferrell may have been in another characters imagination.  I finished it mainly to see how the author tied up certain things and wished I hadn't bothered.  The only reason it's even getting 2 stars is that there were points when the author has Ralph exhibit fits of temper that are quite humorous 
 A beautiful looking cookbook, certainly. I was very excited to try the recipes after receiving the book for Xmas. But what a disappointment. Tried 14 different recipes with fellow baking friends over the course of a week. They weren't bad, but we six bakers let out collective "ho-hums" with each 
 Dear Sean,  Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon.  All my best,  Bill  PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced 
 The author wrote a book on sexuality, while considerably lacking knowledge about women and female sexuality 
 Hirsch's book starts out like he is going to rattle some cages but then, he leaves the New Testament and degenerates into sociological bafflegab. He is neither a dilligent exegete nor a careful historian. Save your money. This book will be added to the scrapheap of failed theories. Better to buy a book that tells how to do it the Jesus way 
 Using this book as a required text for a brush up/seminar course for an MBA program, I've found this book did not do enough reviewing for me with regards to creating financial reports-- income statement, statement of cash flows, balance sheet, etc. I had managerial accounting, financial accounting and financial management in undergrad, however, this book still lacks the concrete basics of "what goes where on a financial report and why". Speaking to my undergrad accounting department chair, I found my opinion agreed with her's-- Kimmel is verbose and lacks clarity/simplicity for those without an accounting focus or background 
 Cynthia Froning's review covers it quite well.  You don't expect much in the way of plausibility from a novel about a woman time traveling back to the time of Jane Austen, but plausibility is kicked so often and so resolutely to the curb in this book that it becomes utterly impossible to care about these characters.  The silliest acts of stupidity are reserved for the heroine, but her feckless suitor is a close second, and together they have all the self control of hungry puppies.  (ex: They are shocked and dismayed when having sex on a bench in the middle of a garden party is frowned upon...)   Even Jane Austen comes of as an idiot, as her out of context self quotations make her seem like the queen of non-sequitors.  The author's 'extensive research' seems to be the justification for the most dramatically unmotivated sequences - thirty minutes with a decent history book would probably suffice for anyone who wants to write a book that is similarly well supported 
 This book is fine for getting an idea about what medieval costume looked like but don't plan to use it as a source for historical costume research. The illustrations in this book are redrawings and Norris doesn't even tell you where he originally copied the pictures from.  Save your money 
 If you are new to Kanban, this book is not for you. It only gives a small description on how to run a kanban system 
 I am a fan of modest mouse at least most of there stuff I didn't like long drive loved moon and antartic and thought lonesome crowded west was good this one however has only one good song to offer the fruit that ate itself is a great song well worth downloading better than any song on long drive or lonesome crowded west but the rest of the cd is garbage so save your money and download that one song 
 The author's views on Islam are probably accurate.  It is a religion that is diametrically opposed to the teachings of Scripture but his understanding of that becomes faulty when he tries to predict the outcome of things that God has expressly hidden.  Prophecy fever always diverts attention from the needs of the world.  I have not found a book that moves the church to reach out.  The solution offered by the author of these sorts of works typically urge you to go literally or figuratively out to a mountaintop to await Christ and in effect to ignore the world.   Follow this sort of advice and you will be "of the world" but not in it... you will out of fear flee the world as the world would flee any other danger.  Perfect love casts out fear and the glory of the church is not in seeing the future and protecting itself but in sacrificial service to advance the kingdom 
 I was really excited to find a book merging Six Sigma and Software Development, but after reading the book, I still have no idea "how" I would implement the methodology.  Tayntor clearly understands the Six Sigma theory and practice, but fails to convice me of its relevance to system development life cycle (SDLC) models.   In the book, we learn the Six Sigma methodology, consisting of the steps "Define - Measure - Analyze - Improve - Control," works well for certain business models. The main goal of Six Sigma is to satisfy the "voice of the customer" or VOC. The VOC describes the needs or requirements of the customer.  To ensure that outputs meet the customers' requirements, you must identify, quantify, and control the critical process inputs called X's. This control over the Xs reduces variation in the outcomes (or Y's).   For software developers, using Six Sigma to fully understand the Voice of Customer (VOC), means substantial savings and better overall product quality.  Most costs overruns in software development are the result of poorly defined requirements. With Six Sigma and SDLC, the problem is implementation. We are not counting widgets, but discussing abstract intellectual processes. This a hard thing to quantify. I can count errors and I can reduce errors, but is bug free code necessarily good code?   Jeannine Siviy said it best when she described Six Sigma methods in manufacturing as "mature", but applications in software development are still "emerging".  If you are really trying to implement Six Sigma, I would recommend, Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit for Software Development Managers  by Mary Poppendieck and Tom Poppendieck. 
 Laura Childs writes like an adolescent girl.  With sentence fragments.  And italics.  The background of tea knowledge will be of interest to aficionados.  The mystery is light and the story overall entertaining.  But there is no character development: no changes or growth in anyone.  An entertaining light read.  But there's not enough here to intrigue me to read others in the series.   
 Although it could be more, this book is only an in depth historical study of the prophets from a Jewish perspective.  However, as Christians, we know that Jesus came to fulfill the law and the prophets. The prophets in this study were warning the Jewish people, but they were also foretelling the good news about Jesus Christ, the Messiah. Yet, Heschel ignores this essential purpose of God for the prophets. Yes, the prophets had a profound place in the history of the Jewish people, and, even though Heschel ignores the truth, and glosses over key verses like Isaiah 7:14, the prophets' message is not confined to that small time or that people in history, as Heschel would have us believe, but is still relevant to all of us today to point the way to Jesus Christ as the Savior and Deliverer of the whole world 
 Whatever happened to Elizabeth Lowell's steamy romances like "To The Ends of the Earth" and "Winter Fire"?  "The Wrong Hostage" was...well, it was boring and confusing.  There was so much unnecessary dialog about Mexican politics and drug lords that I just tuned it out. (Oh, I listened to this book on CD.)  There was zero chemistry between Grace and Joe and only one steamy scene between them. This was very slow moving to the point that by the time I got to the last CD, I was so bored that I just wanted it to end. It was way too long; way too complicated; definitely not worth the time it took to finish it 
 Kiyosaki warns you stright away that this book will not suit 9/10 people.  Still I proceeded to read the book and found the information presented to lack substance and detail.  Some of the infromation contained in this book is indeed useful but it is very hard to asborb what is useful when the book has been written in a non consise and repetitive manner.  Kiyosaki mentions the stock market bear run of 00-03 and investors losing 7-9 trillion dollars in detail so many times that you begin to look for any other information this book has to offer.  No mention is given to the stock market rally after this time and the gains that followed.  For someone that does not seem to like the idea of mutual funds and the stock market in general, Kiyosaki loves to quote Buffet.  He seems to understand the market better then people such as Graham and Buffet in the way he can predict market cycles and is able to time his investments.  Based on Kioysaki's own statement, this book will not suit 9/10 investors 
 The editors of Popular Mechanics have bizarrely resorted to name calling and pseudo-psychoanalysis of anyone who questions the profoundly unbelievable official story of 9/11/2001.  They have denied the fact that there was molten steel roiling in the rubble of the Twin Towers, and WTC Building #7, for weeks after 9/11/2001.  Why is this important?  Jet fuel and building fires do not burn hot enough to melt steel.  Physics Professor, Steven Jones, found traces of the patented controlled demolition steel cutting agent "thermate" in the WTC debris.  If thermate is what cut the steel in the WTCs that means "controlled demolition brought the towers down, not the plane fires as Popular Mechanics would have us believe.  To place controlled demolition charges you'd have to have access to security of the WTCs.  19 Arabs did not have such access.  However, GW Bush's brother and cousin were on the board of Securicom, the Kuwaiti based security company that controlled the WTCs security.  Employees in the WTCs testified of security anomalies in weeks leading up to 9/11, including security camera blackouts, and the stopping of normal bomb-sniffing dogs routines days before 9/11/2001.  WTC, which was referred to by Rosie O'Donnell on The View, was not even mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report.  This is critically important because WTC 7 was not even hit by a plane on 9/11, yet collapsed in a classic controlled demolition fashion.  The media, including Popular Mechanics, would have you believe that Rosie or anyone who questions 9/11 is alone and unstable.  This is a myth.  If you google "patriots question 9/11" you'll see a website that lists nearly 100 high level military, intelligence, engineering, and aerospace experts who now believe we've been lied to about 9/11, and in fact many believe now that 9/11 was an inside job.  One such expert is a former head of US aircraft crash investigations.  David Ray Griffin has written several well researched books on 9/11, and also on so-called debunkers like Popular Mechanics.  Griffin shows how people like the Popular Mechanics editors are deceiving you.  Many 9/11 family members are demanding a new 9/11 investigation, yet the mainstream media ignores them, and many media, including Popular Mechanics editors, pundits attacked truth seekers suggesting the 9/11 families do not want a new investigation.  This is a lie.  The majority of 9/11 family members do want another truly independent investigation.  The 9/11 Commission was not an investigation but a cover up.  Philip Zelikow who headed the 9/11 Commission over protests of 9/11 family members, was a confidant in the Bush Administration, and co-authored a book with Condaleeza Rice.  He was not qualified to lead an investigation. In fact he steered the Commission away from crucial facts, and also left out key facts in the report.  Once such fact he deleted from the report was then Transportation Secretary, Norm Minetta's testimony that VP Cheney was informed by a staffer several times of an approaching aircraft (the one heading into the Pentagon).  Finally the exasperated aid asked Cheney "Do the orders still stand?"  Cheney retorted, "Of course the orders still stand.  Have you heard anything different?"  Rtd. Air Force Lt. Colonel Robert Bowman, has stated that those orders must have been STAND DOWN orders, because if normal procedures had occurred that flight would have been intercepted by Air Force intercepter jets, just as had occurred routinely over 60 times in 2001 before 9/11.  Why did the 9/11 Commission leave that out of their report?  Why does Popular Mechanics pretend that molten steel was not roiling in the WTC debris for weeks after 9/11?  Popular Mechanics has some 'splainin' to do.  Again, read David Ray Griffin's books on 9/11 and the fake 9/11 Commission investigation 
 I collect oracles of various kinds and have added this to my collection. There are two criteria I use to judge I Ching books and cards. I look first at whether the interpretation has been altered to make it useful in modern terms. This oracle does give a resonably useful description of the card meanings and they are well illustrated. The second is how well the changing lines work...This deck has no interps for changing lines...To me the most important cautions or validations regarading a question are to be found in the changing lines. When the lines aren't allowed to change you don't know the speicifics of the action required. You could set aside the cards and cast coins to produce a hexagram with changing lines. This would allow you to deduce the second hexagram if any...but the transition between the two (meaning of each changing line) would still be lost. I think a lot more could have been done with this deck. I think in creating a deck with a more feminine spirituality she lost site of its value as an Oracle 
   Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by  GM's unhealthy cost structure. The  company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney  UAW sponsored lies to  shift attention away from the  primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it.  Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and  how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore  is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary." 
 John Dean is older version of Joe Wilson.  Media hacks who will do or say anything if it will get them invited to the next Washington Post cocktail party.  It is just so hard to take this guy seriously.  He is not a serious thinker, his book is laced with presumptions and ethics projections to the point that it sounds like a conservative wrote it trying to make fun of a liberal 
 I bought this based on the previous reviews. The book is very thin in content with about 250 cards per exam in the boook itself. It does not nearly cover the needed information.  The CD is better with more flash cards per exam, and a testing engine, but still thin in coverage and explanations.  It has information you can use, but not enough. If it was structured toward the exam requrements it would have been better. If you used the other Cisco press books, you don't need this, not even at the discounted price.  As a comparison, the CCNA flash cards book was much better. 
 As an amateur trying to learn more about canine agression, I was actually quite disappointed with the content of this book.  Overall, there is no significantly new or insightful information in this book, and frankly, much of the information about specific types and symptoms of agression problems in dogs can be had for free, often in better detail and more scientifically presented, on the internet, particularly if one searches for information generated by professionals in the field of canine agression, such as scientific papers presented to veterinary journals. I DID, however, find the chapter on agression testing to be helpful -- I haven't seen this type of testing recommended elsewhere, and I did find it interesting and helpful to see the results of these tests on my young puppy.  That being said, I am working on canine agression issues from more of a preventative than a curative or treatment basis, and I would have to give SERIOUS second thoughts about trying some of the suggested tests on a large, mature, and seriously agressive dog.  To be fair, the authors also suggest a great deal of caution when performing these tests on older dogs. The vast majority of the book is merely a recycled basic obedience course book -- sit, stay, heel, come, etc..  And, while I certainly would agree that a firm command of obedience is especially important to a dog with behavioral issues, I alread have several good books on the subject, such as those by the Monks of New Skete.  Had I known that most of this book was just a rehashed obedience manual, I would have saved my money and skipped it.  Based upon the title, I just expected a lot more out of this book than I got.  For someone who really wants a good, in depth book about canine agression issues and their treatments, I'd say to spend your money on a copy of "Clinical Behavioral Medicine For Small Animals" by Dr. Karen L. Overall from the University of Pennsylvania.  Although this is a very expensive book (it is a textbook for veterinary students and also a reference book for clinical veterinarians), it had the answers I was seeking and was definitely worth the money 
 This film is a documentary, not a movie.  For those of you who admire European films with honest, casual nudity, this film may not be for you.  European films with honest, casual nudity usually are non-pornographic in content.  This film brings the anatomy down to a degrading level.  If you want to view this film, fine, but be prepared for some tears and nausea.  This film is not for the faint-hearted.  Though here in America we do need to let loose our prudishness when it comes to casual nudity, yet, to Europeans who tolerate young children being victims of sexual exploitation I ask, where are your child protection agents, your social workers, your law-enforcement agents, your religious leaders and, for crying out loud, the parents?  I admire Europe's easy-going ways when it comes to casual nudity, whether on the screen or on their beaches, but when you view this film, you might think that a lot has to be said for the way we protect our children in America against sexual exploitation.  I cannot think of a more vicious, sinister crime.  I believe the body has a soul, only these young lads were cheated out of a healthy outlook on the body, let alone a normal, healthy childhood.  My poor heart just cries out to them.  I practically saw the devil through that pornographer in question. I was going to rent "Angels, But Not Angels," but this film, and "Mandragora", were enough for me 
 My husband purchased this charger for me for Christmas, after lots of mornings when my van wouldn't start and he was already gone to work.  Except for having to search far and wide for the right kind of extention cord to plug this thing in, we were excited to have something for those "just in case" moments.  We plugged it in and have left it in since then.  Just this week our battery was dead again.  We excitedly went to use this charger, and lo and behold, it wouldn't work.  We had to call a neighbor to come and give us a jump start.  Later that day the battery was dead again (!!!) and this charger worked that time, so who knows what happened?  We haven't tried the outlet power, so I have no idea how reliable that is.  I won't count on this machine.  Luckily I have a small battery charger that I can plug my car into, and after twenty minutes or so I'm ready to go.  I won't be getting rid of that charger--it's much more dependable 
 Jim Ainsworth clearly demonstrates his extensive financial consulting experience throughout this book.  Much of the information is valuable, and it covers the important beginners' range of knowledge effectively. However,  his 'down to earth' style is not only irritating, it actually makes the  book painful to read. Good written English is not always the same as good  spoken English. Surely the man is a succesful financial consultant, but  that doesn't make him a good writer. It just goes to show that in a hot,  growing industry like financial consulting a book written by a 'qualified'  author will sell even if it is poorly written 
 this book is not worth buying at all.  it seems that the author is cocky and stroking his own ego with some of his stories.  the information in this book is not useful...it's about cheating people at poker...but it is really about his stupid stories filled with inapporopriate language.  it also seems that this book could have been cut down in half if you take out all the stupid stories and repeating stories...I recommend "Gambling Scams" by Darwin Ortiz, much better and more useful 
 Middle-aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife, right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe.  When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage, Gracie finds herself without love, without friends, and most importantly, without status.  (But at least she's still got the money!)  Actually, most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it's hard to follow.  The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they're impossible to relate to.  The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly, lacking polish, wit, or interest.  Especially irritating is Grazer's insistence on using Gracie's name as much as possible.  For example:  "Gracie thought about it; they'd never been to marriage counseling.  Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome.  More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality.  Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased, in the beginning.  Before Gracie learned The Way of the Wife" (p 38).  I lost interest after about 20 pages, plowed my way through 40 more, then gave up.  It's very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography (Grazer/Gracie) and that as a Hollywood wife, Grazer DOES have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published.  Definitely not worth your time 
 I am a voracious reader with some knowledge of art history, but after attempting to read this book for the last six months, I am finally stopping at the half-way mark.  It is certainly full of new facts and demonstrates an exhaustive amount of research, but I find Sweetman's narrative plodding and unorganized.  Also, the book pre-supposes the reader's depth of knowledge on the subject -- the lack of which is quite obviously my problem in enjoying the book 
 Sorry, but I don't see what the big deal is. The Peter Terry character is about as scary-looking as the kid from the movie "POWDER", and barely makes his presence felt in these books. He's talked about, referred to, and fretted over, but that's about it. He shows up now and again, but why? Just to set the protagonist, Dylan Foster, on the trail of another whodunit? How dismally convenient is that?  This is a Rated-G horror story -- perfect for a middle-aged Nancy Drew comeback 
 The Winner and Absolute  truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world 
 I expected this book to help me write MY story. Boy, was I let down! It mostly contains writing exercises about random topics and extensive excerpts from prominent African-American writers. At least the excerpts led me to some works new to me.  I found the African American Guide to Writing Nonfiction by Jewell Parker Rhodes to be a much better book to help the writer tell her story, even a fictional one 
 sorry, i just thought the book was boring and worst of all, its a good story with alot of food for thought, but it was just written so poorly that it was ruined 
 This book was recommended by our baby's pediatrician. Its really a "cry it out" book. So it depends on if that's a method you're willing to inflict on your child. We're looking for a new pediatrician 
 Alyssa Milano's mother (who is also her manager) has made a crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet.  She's denounced such websites' "exploitation" on national TV, and has even developed a side business as a cybercop, lending her web-busting skills to other stars.  Milano's mother/manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film.  Embrace of the Vampire is softcore horror porn, and the source for many of those Milano skin pics.  After TV's Who's the Boss was canceled (but before Charmed returned Milano to star status) Milano was just another unemployed former child actress, so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time.   Milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she'd played in Who's the Boss.  In other words, she wanted to "grow" as an actress.  So she did Embrace of the Vampire, in which she goes topless in several scenes, engages in a lesbian romp with Charlotte Lewis, and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body.  Mission accomplished.  Actually, Embrace of the Vampire uses Milano's virginal image from Who's the Boss by casting her as ... a virgin.  A virgin whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend (albeit asking him not to look), but still, a virgin.  A virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and doesn't know why.  Here's why: Milano is the reincarnation of Martin Kemp's true love.  Some 300 years ago, a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned Kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy.  Now that he's rediscovered Milano, he has three nights to rekindle her love for him.  If so, they will live forever as vampires.  If not, he dies and loses her forever.  Why the sudden three-night deadline?  Why not.  The plot and motivations are paper thin, as is typical of porn.  Milano wanders around campus, wondering why she's having so many sexual dreams, even daydreams.  Her boyfriend wanders about, wondering if she's so pure.  Kemp wanders about, seen by Milano but often not by others.  Lewis wanders about for some bisexual action.  Other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action.  Amid all this wandering there's much carnal action, and more carnal dreaming.  Occasionally, Kemp kills someone for dissing Milano.  John Stanley (in his Creature Features movie guide) correctly refers to it as a "meandering, almost formless script."  Kemp has the best lines.  Like many vampires, he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love.  His appearance is a touch effeminate (too much eyeliner), but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character.  He is part romantic vampire, part bloodthirsty beast.  Lewis's small part is pointless to the "story."  All that's required is that she undress, and when she does, it was worth the wait.  Rachel True (The Craft) has an even smaller role, the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on.  All of the above three are more interesting, more charismatic, than Milano or her boyfriend.  At film's end, Kemp's tearful bloodthirsty angst, and Milano's tearful rediscovery of her love, the "tragic" star-crossed ending, and the Christian iconography, all mirror Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992).  One senses that director Goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material.  However, this is no poor woman's Bram Stoker's Dracula.  Milano is no Winona Ryder and Kemp is no Gary Oldman.  For that matter, none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts.  And the budget just isn't there.  The strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity, which this film tries to hide rather than utilize.  How low was the budget?  Listen, I was an extra on both Bram Stoker's Dracula and Embrace of the Vampire.  (In both instances, I kept my clothes on.)  I worked one day on Embrace of the Vampire.  Don't look for me, I ended up on the cutting room floor, and extras are rarely mentioned in credits.  But let me tell you an "inside story" on the making of this film:  We were shooting in a nightclub on the Sunset Strip.  The extras were divided into three camps: union, nonunion, and Modesto extras.  Union extras earn the most, especially once overtime kicks in, so they were wrapped after eight hours (they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota).  This was during my nonunion days (I'm in SAG now), so I put in a full 14 hours, after which we were paid in cash and wrapped.  The Modesto extras were still working when we left.  Now what, you may ask, is a Modesto extra?  I also wondered, and so I asked one.  I was told they were from an acting class in Modesto, California.  They had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a "class assignment."  In other words, they were PAYING to come to work.  There's not a whole lot to learn about being an extra.  It's neither glamourous nor difficult.  And nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are VERY EASY to come by.  The lampposts in Los Angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle, ehr, extras.  I did it for the cash, and because if you do it often enough, you increase your chances of getting into the union (which I did, after some 13 grueling months).  NEVER PAY for the "chance" to be an extra, not in Los Angeles.  I made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times, but wised up after a few months.  My guess is the producers of Embrace of the Vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle, and far less than even nonunion extras cost.  I know this teacher was getting paid by the students, and that they were not getting paid to be on the film.  Another inside story: Someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member.  She was near tears because it had sentimental value.  Never leave anything of value lying around on a set.  And some trivia: John Stanley says this film was "originally conceived as The Nosferatu Diaries," but on the set, we were told the working title was The Collector.  Embrace of the Vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely.  If you're looking for horror, there are hundreds of better films.  Dozens of better vampire films.  Even many superior erotic vampire films -- Vampyres (British, 1975) comes to mind.  But if you're looking for Milano nudies, this is the film to see. 
 At first glance in the store, this book fueled my interest in the Orthodox Church.  Further, the easy style of writing made me feel very comfortable.  However, upon purchsing the book and diving-in, I was soon put-off my the author's frequent caustic remarks about the Episcopal Church, my own denomination.  Not only did these remarks add nothing to the book, but simply showed that the author still has unresolved issues of her own concerning the denomination she left to join the Orthodox Church.  These put-downs simply took away from her work and credability.  While her account of falling in love with the Orthdox liturgy and the "truth" she found in this denomination, nothing is said about ortho-praxis, or the "right-practice" of the faith.  I hear about a lovely liturgy with an actient tradition behind it, but nothing about what her church is doing to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, visit the sick and imprisoned.  In other words, I was left with the sense that the Orthodox church was a lovely museum piece with little active engagement of the Gospel in the broken world in which we live.  "Faith without works is dead," and I'm left with an impression that the Orthodox church is lovely and old, but dead.  While it is my hope that this is not the case, one would not know it from simply reading this book.  Further, while the author uses a very reader-friendly style, there are times you think she wishes she had the talent of Anne Lamott to convey her faith at a no-bones heart-level.  The author can't quite pull that off.   While an enjoyable read about a woman's story of coming to the Orthodox church, it has a few serious flaws which detracts from the picture she would like to paint.  
 I used this book in my sophomore year Intro to EE class and it has to be the most horribly written technical textbook ever. I read from the book only once the whole semester and spent the rest of the time learning from tutors and lecture notes. The examples are cryptic and poorly explained and the chapters are haphazardly organized. I pity those who're forced to buy this for their EE classes, but if you have a choice, you can definitely find yourself a much better textbook than this piece of junk 
 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 This bigwheel is so poorly made.  You have to affix the pedals and they do not stay on.  We put duct tape around the rod that holds the pedals on so they would stay.  The seat back has cracked already and we've only owned it one month.  The tassles on the handles don't stay in and the wheels are completely smooth so they offer no traction.  Lastly, there is no breaking mechanism.  Anyone who remembers riding a bigwheel knows that having a break is a must if you like to "skid out"!  Keep looking.        
 I did not like this book at all.  I found it weird that Merrick is soooo close to Tabby, Laren's brother.  In the next book Lord of Falcon Ridge, Cleve tells a Duke that Merrick love his brother-in-law Tabby more than he  loves his own sons.  Cleve goes on to say that he hopes.  Boring Merrick's  son does not find that out.  This book hase nothing interesting in it 
 This unfortunate book suffers from an acute case of aphoristic intoxication, evidenced in such pithy morsels as: "like most cynics he was profoundly sentimetal about sex" and "our marriage was the meeting of zero and zero."  Although such modestly entertaining observations kept me plodding along, the book is a lame attempt at armchair beat philosophizing, ensnarled in a wholly unengaging plot and unbelievably boring characters. I first read about this greatest of books in Joe Ezterhas's biography, and it makes sense that he would consider its shallow machisimo the stuff of masterpieces.  Avoid this. Reread Day of the Locust. Recommended for only the most die-hard of Hollywood historians or cultural completists 
 This CD is a great collection of one of Rocks best gutar players. I've been a great fan of Joe Satriani ever sence I heard "Big Bad Moon"* (*Track eight on the C.D.)and have enjoyed many other pieces of his career 
 We enjoy Maxwell's look at leadership. This book hits on the subject of what if you are not the Boss can you still influence people. We thought it was so good we gave it as a gift to a friend to encourage him 
 This is on the overall a good book as the other reviews have testified.  There is one major problem, the author talks very little about risk.  She recommends that you get deeply into debt and use that leverage to make money.  That's ok and many people have made money that way.  Many people have also lost their shirt that well as well.  The book would have been much enhanced is she spent a chapter talking about the risks involved with taking on massive amounts of debt, especially for the small investor - the target audience - who likely doesn't have much to lose.  She should've included several case studies, some that look those who have successfully used leverage (debt), and looked at some who lost everything.  Then she could've analyzed what were the underlying factors and decisions that led to either failure or success.  Instead the author casts debt in an overly positive light, saying almost nothing about the risks involved.  This is all well for her, she began to buy several years before the biggest real estate boom in the history of the country.  But there have been plenty of real estate markets in the past where investors took on too much debt and lost not only their investment properties, but everything else as well.  Any credible book about investing has a responsibility to spend a healthy amount of time discussing risk.  It's like being enthusiastic about a medication but not saying anything about the potential side effects or hazards.  Such an approach is bad medicine, and Ms. Thomas' book is bad teaching because she ignores the subject of debt, and for that reason I took off 3 stars.    Beyond that, it's a very good starter book.  
 Oliver's book provides a good deal of information on beer styles, but it is more or less a watered down version of some of Michael Jackson's books (which I would recommend purchasing instead of this one).  His food pairings are helpful, but nothing a slightly adventurous beer drinker with a decent beer store nearby couldn't figure out on his/her own.  I have given this book only two stars for the following reasons.  This book is exhibit A of why commericial brewers should not write beer books.  While reviewing all of the different styles of beer, Oliver also includes "notable producers" of each style.  Every style, it seems, that Oliver's Brooklyn Brewery produces makes it onto this list; a book, according to me at least, should NOT be an advertisement (or not in such a blatant way).  The guy's name is already all over the book as it is!  This aspect of the book particularly bothered me because in my opinion Brooklyn beers are mediocre across the board and certainly do not stand up to the other "notable" selections in each section.  Oliver is putting Brooklyn beers on par with some of the best beers in the world!  Even worse, Matt Brewing makes it in at times, which is conveniently a company that contract brews some beers for Brooklyn.  Nice plug, Garrett!  Bottom line: Brooklyn Brewery cannot hold a candle to 99% of the other breweries noted in this book (except Matt Brewing, of course).  If New Yorkers make you mad, then you should avoid this book as well.  Several times throughout the book Oliver points out how sophisticated and metropolitan he is, and makes fun of someone who might have run out of the woods of Tennessee looking for some fried squirrel (he is actually referring to himself with this story, but it is snobby nonetheless - do such people even exist?).  Finally, if you are not interested in "tasting notes" then leave the book alone.  Otherwise you will be reading dozens of times how Oliver thought the beer tasted "biscuity" (or like cat piss or wet wool blankets, believe it or not).  Overall, an average book at best.  There are much better beer books out there 
 I purchased this item in December 2005 but didn't use it until July 2006.  The wires broke on my first use.  I thought about requesting a replacement from KitchenAid but have decided instead to ask for a refund.  This item is a total waste of time and money 
 I have a kitten I can't keep up with and thought this would be a great idea. Wrong, he figured it out and lost interest in the first day. He will play with it for a few minutes but then looks to see where the beam is coming from, figures it out and walks away. A whole 2 minutes of fun 
 Here is a synopsis of the book so you may spend your money elsewhere:  1) Don't diet 2) Get used to your "new" menopausal figure--ie. learn to love it. 3) Exercise 4 times a week for at least an hour so you feel better--but don't expect miracles in the weight-loss department. Well. duh!  I really felt the book rambled on about the obvious and in the end, I just ended up feeling depressed.  What the book did manage to do was to thoroughly explain the biological process of why your body is changing.  That, I already knew!  
 I bought this movie because I was trying to find movies appropriate for "movie night" with my three year old. I read the reviews that say what a great kids' movie this is....boy was I surprised when the mother is KILLED in the opening scene! As we watched the movie, my daughter's dad and I could not believe that it was scene after scene of threats to the fox, who is a loveable character. Gun-toting Amos is over the top...the bear is unnecessarily scary....we found very little of it redeeming (the last scene where Copper stops Amos from killing Tod). I did like that the widow stands her ground with grumpy mean Amos. We also felt that the romantic overtones between the two foxes was completely unnecessary for this age group. DO we need to introduce physical attraction as the primary reason for interest between the sexes? VERY disappointed and will be giving this movie away 
 I was so disappointed in this book. I too expected to find tons of resources to help with homeschooling and instead found a book full of links that either didn't work or cost to use. There was nothing free about this book to be honest. You can't even get onto the website that supposedly keeps the book from being outdated. Instead you are left with nothing. Thankfully I was able to return this and buy something useful.  
 This is my first review ever on Amazon. I currently about 1/3rd through the first book, and it has taken me about three months to get that far.  I honestly do not understand the praise attributed to the book. The story just doesn't flow for me, the author riddles the chapters with pointless thoughts from side characters, that serve no purpose in advancing the plot.  I do not even think the book began well. Maybe it is a cultural thing, but... The Seneschal - In history was an adviser to a King, or an officer of important nobles. It is hard for me to translate this into a religious sect. The King's privy chamber - Yes I know privy means private, etc, but all I could think about, when the book mentioned the privy chamber, was a bathroom, I don't know why, but that is what came to mind.  Maybe I am spoiled, but this is a list of authors that I can think of off the top of my head that people would be better off spending there money on. George RR Martin CJ Cherryh Robert Jordan Orson Scott Card RA Salvatore (simple but entertaining and easy to read) David Eddgings Terry Brooks  Updated: My 18 month old got a hold of this book and shredded some pages before I finished, and I don't even care. That is how bad it is 
 AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.  	If you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)"  Or try to interpret this one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)"   	At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "intelligent design."  He can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.  	Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane 
 I didn't like these sheets, because you have to put them inside of the matress I do like their softness though, but they are very hard to put on the bed 
 I used the James Stewart 5e for the first quarter for calculus.  But I switched schools and this school used the Hughes Hallett book.  Pros:  None  Cons:  There not enough reference pages.    There only a total of 2 pages back and front for the whole calculus book.  This book is used for 3 quarters of calculus and this book ONLY has 2 references.  It would be nice to able look back in reference page to refresh my head from first quarter calculus formula but this book has a short list.  James Stewart is better in the way that it takes an extra step to include lots Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry formulas.    Solution manual only has every other odd.  I bought solution manual without looking at it.  They only have a solutions for problem 1, 5, 9, 13, and etc.  The review problems are the same thing where they only work out every other odd problem.  I was able to return this solution manual.  I am super happy I didn't have waste any more money into this book.  Those two cons make me hate this book.  I would recommend that if you had to buy the book, look to other books for reference pages.  Unless your teacher assigns every other odd, I wouldn't buy the solution manual 
 Wright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "the road to 9/11."  Understanding Qutb's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss' followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "friend and enemy" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "state of exemption."  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary, "The Power of Nightmares" or "From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.  If you prefer to stick with fiction about "the road to 9/11," check out Patrick S. Johnston's novel "Mission Accomplished. 
 This book is rediculously boring. How a person can actually put their name on a piece of writing that so bad leaves me dumb founded. If anyone can find me anything similar to Cliff's Notes for this book, I'd love you forever, because in 1 month I've read 100 pages, and I'm 1 of those that actually enjoys reading. It had facts, but that's about it. Wow a summer well wasted.. 
 Not pretty enough for a coffee table book and definitely not informative enough as a resource for an architecture student. 
  Fans of Anne McCaffrey's Pern series will want to give a pass this attempt by her son to repeat her success. It is a lackluster telling of what could have been an excellent tale. Todd McCaffrey has none of his mother's talent for involving the reader in the tale or character development. The characters lack depth and the story line jumps and jerks rather than gliding from chapter to chapter 
 Most who are reading reviews at this point have read the book, or at least know the plotline.  Like Books 1 & 2, the hero is Mike Murphy--a Raider's of the Lost Ark type archeologist, with strong conservative evangelical Christian convictions.  He's thrust into a near-end times world, and encounters numerous adventures--so so many.  The whole idea might be too James Bondish, and a bit to Left Behindish for many, but I found this one of the better spin offs--at least the first two books were.  Europa made all the mistakes the other two did not:  1.  Far too many dialogues that were really little sermons, or conservative political commentary.  2.  The message got more important than the plotline--all subtlety was abandoned.  Hey, I'm a preacher myself--but this is false advertising.    3.  Unlike the first two...this book ended mid-action, mid-scene.  I rather appreciated that the other stories were both self-contained, and loosely affiliated.  This one forces you to get book 4, if you have the patience to seek closure.  4.  Too many cliches this time around.  The manly men had bristling muscles, were smart--but not in a bookish, non-athletic sort of way.  5.  Poor Isis--the woman who promised to destroy the complaint lodged against Left Behind--that women were kept behind scenes, or 1950s tradition.  This scholar, beauty, and courageous soul becomes needy, contemplative, and fearful.  They turned her into Beaver's mom!  On the upside, the tempo remained pretty crisp, and devoted Left Behind/Tim Lahaye fans will probably keep buying.  I will (though definitely used, like I did this one! 
 The isbn number I ordered was 0072866845 the isbn # I recieved is 007121582-4 or 007121427-5 both numbers are on the book 
 I bought this book on a whim at a bookstore when my infant was fussing in the shopping cart.  I didn't read the book jacket well enough before buying it and most likely would not have purchased it had I known that the technique only involved throwing a party.  Like a previous reviewer said, this method will only work if your child enjoys a party and likes to have a fuss made about them.  My son isn't shy, but he gets embarrassed easily.  I need to take a more mellow approach to his accomplishments or he refuses to repeat them.  This book wasn't for us 
 First thing's first-- this release is properly titled "The Perfect Drug Versions"-- the original mix is not on this album.  If you're looking for that, you've either got to get the rather expensive import copies of this or the "Lost Highway" soundtrack.  Having gotten that out of the way, turning to this issue-- this is five mixes of the track "The Perfect Drug", by such folks as the Meat Beat Manifesto, Plug, Nine Inch Nails, Spacetime Continuum and the Orb.  I'm really pretty ignorant of dance/techno/drum-n-bass/whatever music, so a couple of these names mean nothing to me.  These are all dance/house/dub mixes, i.e. the vocals have been lifted from them and relegated either to a sample or to repititious lines.  To be direct, this isn't my thing.  Some of the dub mixes that showed up on earlier singles I found tolerable, but in the context of the rest of the material on the single, as this is nearly 40 minutes of this sort of stuff that I don't listen to, I find it nearly unlistenable.  One on one, some of the tracks are certainly interesting, the Meat Beat Manifesto remix being the most listenable and I think with the best beats and arrangement.  Not really sure what to make of the Spacetime Continuum mix, they seem to have ditched the original song except and written something new sampling a line from the chorus once or twice.  The Orb remix is full of good ideas, but falls short of succeeding and drags on seemingly endlessly.  I found both the Plug and the NIN remixes to be irritating, quite frankly.  So maybe I'm not the best person to review this-- if you like this sort of thing, you'll probably like this more than I did, but I find this a painful listen.  You're on your own as to whether or not you should get this 
 I was awaiting this film for over a year and it finally made it to the States. I was over joyed to buy it. After I finished watching the movie, I thought to myself " Did I get the right movie?"   Truth is: This movie has nothing to do with Andrei Chikatilo. All and I mean all facts and incidents are incorrect. The film is not true to Chikatilo's real lifestyle. The acting is fake and embarrasing to watch. Malcolm McDowell looks like Adolf Hitler, not Chikatilo. The director deviates this movie so far from reality, it's sad to give him credit for it.   Oooh and by the way, if you want to see Malcolm get naked together with a cop and have the cop jerk him off, While yelling " Look how hard your prick is," please feel free to buy this movie. Talk about hardcore facts about Andrei Chikatilo jerking cops off on the side. Waste of time, money and complete disappointment. You want the true Chikatilo, see Citizen X instead.  
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 Eck writes what was could have been a great book about a very important subject.  She has a great deal of background in this area, and reminds you of this background throughout the entire book.  It is filled with stories of her travels, and her extremely one sided arguements.  Although she makes some great points, the stories are overabundant, and the book is completely redundant.  If you read the prelogue, and the first chapter of each of the three sections (Islam, Hindu, and Buddhism) then you will be able to answer any question someone asks you of the entire book, yes it is that redundant.  If you enjoy reading the same thing in a book more than 15 times this is the book for you, but if you are on an actual search for knowlege and want to learn something without bias, look elsewhere 
 Kostova's Historian is an ultra-affirmative wild dormitory-fantasy conjuring up best-forgotten sentiments from times when our anthropology-lectures seemed just so important that nights where spent in the kitchen with unceasing discoveries of how absolutely everything revolves around the field of study our middle-class background allowed us to indulge in.  The action comprises of the second major middle-class fallacy of our time: the exitement of travel, 16 of which are rendered in an invariable pattern of arrival, very short Baedecker-summary and a beverage in a local equivalent to Starbucks, where people relate their related histories in always the same level of detail - conjuring up best-forgotten university-afternoons wasted in important debate between lectures. Actually, in three layers of time (1930ies, 1950ies, 1970ies), Kostova's world is without exception populated by scholars and professors (her most recurrent words throughout the first third of the novel, before the terms library" and librarian" take over at a rate of up to ten times per page): all of them idolized with the veneration of unthinking and note-jotting sophomores, all of them characterized by terming anything remotely academic as remarkable" (probably the fourth-most prevailing term of the entire novel). Borrowing its form of epistolary novel 1:1 but mindlessly from Bram Stoker, Kostova underscores each of her models (Umberto Eco, Donna Tart, even wooden but skillfull Dan Brown in literature, Blade" and Underwold" in popular culture - she is, by the way, thoroughly unacquainted with the Dracula-Movies of the thirties) by a lack of fluency in arranging her material in any manner other than that of a backpacker's greasy and best-forgotten moleskin-diary on an interrail-trip: letters are constantly read awkwardly and delayingly on bus and train - in lieu of anything happening. While deaths occur (16, two of which unrelated to the events, three mere repeat killings of one evil librarian", one the most stunningly unspectacular death of a major villain ever, and - probably the cruellest - one of a cat), actual horror is limited to shudders" suffered by the protagonists while reading of some of Draculas crimes against humanity" in latin (809) - or any of no less then seven languages commanded by each of the scholarly cast (see 94, 111, 216, 446, 486), the admiration for which in the absense of content to convey is the third middle-class falacy of our time. The whole, highlighted most palpably by chapter 39 on Hungarian history and the lengthy Chronicle of  Zacharias" of 1479 (chapter 59), is pretty much as exciting as the critical notes and apparatus of any Arden Shakespeare (a lost play of whom on Dracula she brashly invents without the scholarly scope to see the probability of such a plot conforming rather with the styles of Marlowe or Webster, which would have suited her heavy pseydo-academic smokescreening better anyway). However, this is probably the first horror-novel of the new generation of the formerly politically correct, now grown over-protective parents, meticulously aware of the deletarious impact of TV, video-games, non-organic food and second-hand smoking, written upon a sudden vision, you know, that intuition that a scholar can almost trust when it's backed by weeks of careful work" (36) - repeat specimen of which level of erudition can be cherished on pages 41, 46, 98, 131, 149, 163, 175, 205, 216, 217, 224, 231, 233f, 253, 299f, 318, 320, 344, 360, 370, 381, 396, 469, 542, 547, 552, 641, 660, 670, 725, 729, 730, 747, 801 or practically everywhere in the Back Bay edition (I obviously numbed a bit to it in the later stages). But hey, what can you expect when historians begin using their imaginations?" (483) 
 A big help to me in my game . The biggest help i got from another of rotellas books directly with putting and as a result i have never seen so many birdies in a round due directly to the said two books 
   Tens of thousands of books are published every year: few of them sell more than a couple of thousand copies at best. Sometimes you come across a book from a "name" publisher and wonder why the manuscript wasn't tossed into the wastbasket. This is one of those books.    This book is filled with New Age nostrums. "Let's visit the cosmic sphere tht contains our neighborhood - the center of our visible universe." (By the way, Leo Tolstoi visited this neighborhood in the 19th Century in his "The Kingdom of God is Within You.") More great advice from Primack and Abrams, the husband-wife team that claims great new cosmological insights: "Movement becomes a mere idea. There is no visible way to detect it, only the tricky conciousness of time passing." Here's another gem: "The Cosmic Las Vegas metaphor illustrates trhe random, quantum nature of eternal inflation, but it gives no sense of what the theory of eternal inflation could mean if it is true." Yeah. Sure.    Reciting every mawkish statement in this pretentious tome would take as much space as the book itself. As a final example, how about "We represent  an age on Earth comparable to the age of cosmic inflation at the beginning of the universe: brief, but about to set the pattern for the long-term future. . . . For our entire species, today matters."    This New Age gruel is served up as a plea for scientific thinking. It is anything but. It is a feel-good tract on how special you are, much like the character in the classic Saturday Night Live sketch.    Greater good could have been done by saving the trees sacrificed for the paper the nonsensical nostrums of Priamck and Abrams are printed on.  Jerr 
 The card was defective. Have applied for refund from amazon and have bought another to see if this one works. hopefully won't have to keep doing this too many times... have already wasted a lot of time on this. Pretty frustrating 
 I love the pictures. The pictures are great, bright and.....MADONNA! But....the calendar is horrible!!  I am not one to write on my calendars (because I collect them) but, on this you do not have that option because there are no boxes to write in. The dates are written like this..... Monday    01 Tuesday   02 Wednesday 03   etc....  There are no holidays printed on the calendar so, there is nothing to flip to and look and see what day of the week a specific holiday is on. So, I am not too impressed at all.   If you are looking for a calendar based soley on pictures than this is the one for you but you get ZERO information out of the deal 
 I actually enjoyed his book about Carlyle and it's the reason I bought this book. But there should have been another 300 pages. It did a pretty good job of describing the origins of Halliburton and Brown and Root and described the relationship both Brown and Root and later the combined company had with Lyndon Johnson. But it's other political relationships of the time were not fleshed out, and only briefly mentioned. Basically anything about the companies histories after the late 1950s was brief and I felt shortchanged once I got to this part of the book. (3/4 of the way into it) The change of name to Kellog, Brown and Root was not mentioned, nor were contracts such as Guantanomo or the base on Diego Garcia which sounds to me like it could have warranted quite some ink. Also Kellog, Brown and Root's bankruptcy was glossed over leaving me wondering what the story is on this. The asbestos issue was only briefly mentioned, and Cheney's attempts to reduce these losses by changing the laws wasn't mentioned at all. Information about the companies contracts in Iraq is almost non-existant and the reputed contracts the Company did with countries in Cheney's era under US sanctions (ie Iran) by diverting the contracts via it's overseas subsidiaries gets not even a fraction of a page.  Basically if you after information on these companies after 1962 you're better off researching it on the internet 
 I have no idea where Warner dredged up these desperate, anxiety ridden mommies fretting over Baby Einstein and private schools. As a stay home mom, by choice, I resent the implication that all women who choose to stay home are mired in a unfulfilled tedious life. And as far as these crazy women running themselves ragged - Ladies, you made a CHOICE to book your kids into a gazillion activities. My children are at their most creative with a few blankets, the kitchen table and some cardboards boxes. Remember making kitchen table forts on rainy days? And I am pretty well convinced neither of my kids are going to end up mentally impaired, at the bottom of their class or having their college admission applications rejected because I wasn't tutoring them in conversational Japanese rather than coloring in a color book together each afternoon. And if the childcare system/motherhood support system is so great in France, then move back to France! Encouraging the US government to provide some pie in the sky support is naive and short sighted. Instead, look to cultivating your community and embracing your neighbors as friends and helpmates rather than competition. Making true connection with others in community is a rare and splendid thing. Here on planet Earth, despite the anxious paranoid feeling we are all supposed to be feeling, the Joneses don't give a hang if we drive a Mercedes and they  really aren't out to get us 
 I loved Angel Heart.  I ordered the unrated (x) version from a seller who works with Amazon.  I received the R rated version. I then ordered the special edition from amazon directly which stated it was the unrated version.  However, it was also rated R.  It looks like I will have to buy it here locally.  The movie was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.    If you are going to buy it from either a seller or Amazon, make sure you are getting the correct version 
 Whatever happened to "You can't map a sense of humor" ?? 
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 I bought this book to learn about nutrition.  Not be inundated by your beliefs (not FACTS).  I will not recommend this book.  
 I was disappointed the Soundtrack didn't have the Bonita Applebaum Hootie Mix. I can't find that mix anywhere except on Vinyl. 
 ...but not funny. I don't even know how Cheech and Chong fans could like this movie, because this movie is really different from "Up in Smoke" or their other movies. In "Up in Smoke" there was at least some direction to the movie, but in this movie most of it is composed of lame comedy gimmicks that were entirely not funny unless you are high off your ass or have an I.Q. less than 20. They don't even smoke in this movie! The closest thing they do to drugs is eat some marijuana leaves... how stupid do they think we are? Stay away from this one 
 Gonazlo Rubalcaba and New Cuban Quartet - Paseo.  2/5  Forty-one year-old Cuban-born Pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba has released his 23th recording with Paseo this year.  On the opening track the Latin-flavoured El Guerrillero (The Soldier), the drums beg to turn on a dime a few times, but they simply stamp out at the same pace.  The instrumentation is fine but the track doesn't stand out.  What's most striking about this CD is that Gonzalo Rubalcaba is a master technician of diverse styles.  Witness his sublime balladry on Sea Change.  This is a style he displayed when I saw Charlie Haden perform in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2002.  The major fault with this disc, though, is that  it doesn't sound improvised enough.  There's too much structure and the compositions aren't terribly interesting.  They do have the sheen of modernity, but when you listen below that layer, there's little that qualifies as being memorable.  There's not enough tension and interplay between the otherwise capable musicians.  At times, some of the tracks sound "busy" without having an engaging groove to them.  As an interpreter of jazz, Rubalcaba is as good as anyone.  He knows how to cut loose and deftly swing.   On Paseo, regardless of the inspiration behind the compositions, he's holding back, in fact, the music gives me a stifling sensation.  If you read a lot of the reviews of his albums, they often say similar things: great chops, masterful technician, not so memorable composer.  If you really want to hear Rubalcaba doing some mind-blowing piano playing, you owe it to yourself to check out Discovery - Live At Montreau from 1991.  Listen to the fantastic first track, Monk's "Well, You Needn't" and be prepared to be bowled over by its virtuosity and electricity.     It's widely regarded as one of the best major label debuts, with drumer Paul Motian and Charlie Haden on the bass.  If Gonzalo Rubalcaba were returning to my town, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to buy tickets and I would recommed him to jazz fans.  I would only hope, though, that he would shed his shackles and do some serious swinging. 
 Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional.  Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her.  Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers.  I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents.  These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up.  The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs.  I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much.  He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.    In summation, if you like this movie, you have been dumbed down by the evil Hollywood machine, and I suggest you check out good foreign films like A Good Marriage and beautiful scandals like Valmont immediately.  There is no excuse for liking unmoving, plastic dreck of this nature.   
 I'm giving up on this book.  It reads like a first draft.  Sentences like the following on page 71 abound: "When you hear not so often as you wish, remember, our silence means our safety," the Committee of Secret Correspondence  - now doing business as the Committee for Foreign Affairs, although Franklin, who had never mastered the original name, was not to know for months - soothed the envoys, whom they understood to be starved for news.      Schiff needed a good editor but didn't get one.  This certainly isn't Pulitzer grade material.  I wonder if the publisher rushed this book into print in time for the 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth.      Van Doren in his biography gives a better account of Franklin's years in Paris. 
 I've taken a couple film classes in college thus far and I have to say - this book is not very enlightening.  For the most part, this book takes concepts about film and assigns them terms to call them.  It spends a lot of time stating the obvious and little time going into any significant depth on any topic.  It is a long book full of general information that you will already know if you are a regular movie-goer, nevermind a student of film.  It lacks significant coverage of the history of film and is excessively verbose.  I recommend avoiding it if you can and not paying the full price if you must buy it for class.  You can learn far more about film simply by doing searches in Google.  The freely available information on the Internet far surpasses the mediocre offerings of this book 
 Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it.  I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it.  I made it through the CD once with my kids, but that was it.  We will not be listening again.  As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).  The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.    
 It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport.  I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed.  If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.  Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad.. 
 Well now that the dot com bubble has burst volume II can be the eviction of gentrification 
 Poor dialog, ho-hum artwork, contrived characters. DMZ promises to deliver a gritty, meaningful story about urban warfare in the US, but fails. We're asked to follow a rich kid turned newspaper reporter through the "DMZ," a Manhattan caught in the middle of a brutal American civil war. The main character, Matty, doesn't seem to have any reason to be in the besieged city, nor any reason to stay. He's truly one-dimensional, lacking motive or background. This novel is devoid of any real story. It's simply a series of brutal scenes seen through the eyes of a naive protagonist. The dialog is stilted, clumsy and, in most cases, cringe worthy. The artwork is barely worth mentioning. It lacks any real originality or style. Art of similar quality could be found in the sketchbook of any marginally talented high school art student. It amazes me that this piece was published 
 Anyone interested in finding out about the real nature of biological diversity should read " The Structure of Evolutionary Theory" by Stephen Jay Gould 
   I'll start by saying that I am a huge fan of Fantasy novels, but this 'crux' of Fantasy literature really disappointed me.   This book has a lot of faults. To begin with, it goes against the first basic rule of writing a book: show don't tell. As you start the novel, it tells everything and nothing has been shown. Tolkein has just narrated almost everything, starting from the history to the setting, and this gives the novel a feeling as if a child has written it.   Secondly, the book is just too slow. I mean you just start the 1st chapter and you doze off after a couple of pages. The pace might have been fine for the 50's but it's just too slow for the double Os!   I don't know why other people liked the plot so much, but I think the plot was really really weak. The causality in the story is almost non-existant and that is what makes the difference between a jumble of short stories joined loosely together and a good novel.   Lastly, the characters could have been much developed with more life in them than mere puppets bound to do the author's bidding. The chracters are much more Archetyped than they should have been.   Overall, I think that it has gotten more attention than it deserved, perhaps because of the movies, and that people are liking it because of some trend or the like 
 I have not had a good pillow in a long time.  I wouldn't pay upwards of fifty dollars for a pillow.  But I gave in after reading the reviews and got this one.  It's way overpriced in my opinion but they are onto a very good idea.  First, I have had it for a couple of weeks and it's pretty flat now.  The coils are only in the very center of the pillow, and at times you do notice them there, but not in a bad way, just noticable.  The problem is the fluff they add to the pillow must be the cheapest possible nothing.  I imagine I will have a really strange looking square blob surrounded by a moat of flat fabric pretty soon.  At first, it was really comfy. I think that if they either put high quality fluff around it, or better yet put coils through the entire thing, with higher ones in the center, this would be outstanding, beyond all other pillows!  But as it is, it's not worth the price yet.  If you have tons of money to burn, go ahead and try it.  I wouldn't recommend anyone get two to sleep on at once, they would be awkward and they would be falling off the sides of eachother.  You could use a regular pillow below this one, but then you are back into the same pillow finding - switching game we all want to avoid.  I would have given three stars if it were a lot cheaper, but after going flat after only a few weeks, and the price, I had to give it two 
 Just received this item purchased on 11/21, Unfortunately at that time there were no reviews on it. Again as previous reviews state: Item is not a Professional Outdoor Cooker as listed Still, but a Commercial Grade Cooker; this printed right on the box. Features have now been changed, Orginally stated included with an aluminum basket and fish fry pot & basket. I received the items as listed now. All in All it does appear to be a nice cooker, but I bought it for the versitiliy of the features listed previously. Contacting Customer Service on this Misleading Advertisement.   
   Some people write for the "art crowd." Dense outpourings of words that some of lesser human (like me) find nonsensical; but the really artsy types find fascinating. Perhaps because, like the crowd surrounding the naked emperor, they are afraid of simply telling the truth.    Europe Central is a collection of stories about "the warring authoritarian cultures of Germany and the USSR," wherein according to jacket blurb, the author "compares and contrasts the moral decisions made by various figures from this period - some famous, some infamous, some unknown."    It simply doesn't work, at least not for this reader.    It's overblown, pretentious and far too wordy (just like good proletarian novels about real life are supposed to be).    And it's dreadfully slow reading and, for the most part, boring. Once in a while, something interesting appears, like a rock formation popping out of an otherwise flat plain.    In the hands of someone like Alan Furst, the theme might have worked, though the book would far shorter than this doorstop's 752 ponderous pages. On the whole, you can pass this by and move on with your life.  Jerr 
 In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.  In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.  "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.  Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.  Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.  This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.   But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:  1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.  2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.  3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.  4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.  This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:  "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32)  "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91)  "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97)  "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110)  "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123)  In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.  Rennie Petersen  PS. Just for the record, here is a list of the places covered: Norway (Hammerfest, Oslo), France (Paris), Belgium (Brussels, Bruges, Spa, Durbuy), Germany (Aachen, Cologne, Hamburg), Holland (Amsterdam), Denmark (Copenhagen), Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm), Italy (Rome, Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Florence, Milan, Como), Switzerland (Brig, Geneva, Bern), Liechtenstein, Austria (Innsbruck, Salzburg, Vienna), Yugoslavia (Split, Sarajevo, Belgrade), Bulgaria (Sofia), Turkey (Istanbul) 
 Having loved and used Peterson's excellent Texas guide for years (my first copy having disintegrated years ago, the cover now coming off the second), I found this book woefully disappointing.  The back cover states that 1038 species are described and illustrated -- not true!  While the illustrations the book does contain are quite wonderful in their usual way, most of the birds already contained in Peterson's other North American guides offer only a cursory two or three line description, and no illustration at all -- only the letters E, W, and/or T, which means simply, go look it up in the one of the other books!  Unfortunately for me, I found this book at the last minute at my local public library just before a plane trip to Mexico and only learned about its limitations as I was reading the chapter on "How to Use this Book" after I was already in the air.  I am glad I didn't BUY the book.  I just wish I had at least brought my Texas guide with me, but I didn't realize I needed it.  The book would have been more appropriately titled, "A Field Guide to the Mexican Birds that We Didn't Already Cover" or "Mexican Birds You Didn't Already Know".  Unless you are an expert birder and already know most North American birds by sight, this book is only good as a supplement.  Although I have been birding for over 30 years, I found this book to be completely useless as a stand-alone field guide 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 This is not a comprehensive book on the field of Urban Design. Although this is obvious from the subtitle one is left with dissapointment. Aside from an interesting collection of cases studies you really don't get the complexity and timeless cross-section of this field that is having a renaissance now. None of the current trends are mentioned nor do they get any strong coverage (new urbanism/trasnurbanism/reurbanism/everyday urbanism/splintered urbanism/complexity urbanism) nor does the historical element comes through. Generaly good written book but too much of a sallad bowl without a proper structure and philosophy. Not a good tool for teaching. If you want top of the pops book in this field go to D.Grahame Shane's Recombinant Urbanism. For me it was astonishing how little space was given to new urbanism, the leading urban design theory and practice today 
 We all like hearing scary stories about monsters.  This book provides a few of them.  Because of its pulp horror novel quality it has some redeaming value.  The negatives make it not only a bad read, but make me wish that I had not read it. 1) The author spends a lot of time tooting his own horn. This is fine, but you grow weary of it after a few chapters.  It wouldn't be so annoying but because of the way he writes comes off as if he is trying too hard to make it sound like NOT bragging.  Because of this I grew very aware of it, like when your tounge won't stop worrying at a new tooth-filling. 2) It grows very predictable.  We get it!  Serial killers are psychos who fit into patterns and act out fantasies. It isn't a surprise anymore once we learned this early in the book. 3) Ressler brags about his profile helping to send 4-5 Chicago teenagers to prison for a a grusome murder/rape.  A decade after this book went to press DNA evidence and discovery of the real killers proved that these kids had been railroaded--unequivocally innocent.  Ooops!  This incredibly gross injustice wouldn't seem so terrible if Ressler didn't come off as such a judgemental, I-told-you-so-ing, J. Edgar Hoover loving cop's cop 
 We bought this wagon for our almost 2 year old and at first we loved it.  We bought it for the storage and door, thought it would be easier and she would feel independant.  She did love the door but it would NEVER stay closed, we tried everything.  It would clsoe but as we walked work itself open, our daughter even fell out because it opened as we were walking.  It is a great concept but just didn't work.  We took this back and got the Pathfinder wagon instead 
 The book touches upon certain investment subjects such as TA FA and news reaction in very limited detail which in my opinion could be a serious disadvantage to the newcomer with naive knowledge gained from the book. The book should of stuck to giving an overview of what is on offer on the Internet It should definately of included a chapter to the risks associated with investing online.  I think the reference made to Momentum investments is also not correct 
 I purhcased this book because I am intersted in world religions, especially those with elements of mysticism.  I have often heard references to the Kabbalah and I wanted to learn more about its contents.  I am a college student majoring in biology, psychology, and history, and my desire to study the Kabbalah stems not from required coursework but rather from personal interest.  If I were pursuing a degree in religious studies, or had I been repeatedly exposed to the concepts that Scholem discussed, I would have been fine.  However, it is nearly impossible for a layman to understand the subject matter as presented by Scholem.  There is simply too much jargon and Scholem's writing style makes me wonder as if he tried to make things overly complex to divulge his brilliance.    If you are an experienced religious scholar, most likely this book will be excellent.  However, if you're a layman who is attempting to get a feel for the basic concepts and principles of Jewish Mysticism, this book will only frustrate you because it's too advanced 
 Any positive review of  this book is probably by someone trying to sell it to you. 
 Unfortunately, Blum's work was my first exposure to the Runes. That was several years ago.  Now I have taken up studying Asatru, and am finding that this is the path for me.  It is too bad that many will be exposed to this work, it is full of references to Jesus Christ and Buddha, each of whom have absolutely NOTHING to do with the Odinnic ways or Runecasting. Many would find it offensive to see Teutonic Runes etched onto a crucifix; i feel the same way whenever i see an image of the crucified Christ superimposed on Thor's Hammer. I would give this book Zero stars if allowed. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE SEEKING AUTHENTICITY! Seek out the many works of Edred Thorsson instead 
 For somebody who was not alive in JFK's time, this seemed like a great way to get a feel for the politics and history of the 1960s.  This approach, though, gives only a few minutes, five at most, of each speech and so the  listener gets a famous highlight, but no depth of experience.  I am excited  about the primary exposure, but much more content and length is necessary  for this to be of much use to a serious fan of history or politics 
 I wish I'd listened to the other reviews.  I bought this and it heated for exactly two months and then quit on me.  Claims a five year warranty but I can't return it to Amazon so it's just money wasted.  Be smarter than me, avoid this product if you value your money 
 If a book thoroughly angers and frustrates you, does that mean it's a good book or a bad book?  In the case of MERCY, I'll have to go with the latter.  I found I could not get past my intense dislike of both Cam and Mia, truly two of the most despicable, selfish characters I've ever read in any book.  I've read murder mysteries with killers who had more admirable qualities.  Their sole intent were their own wants and needs, regardless of who (Cam's wife Allie) got hurt.  Allie was described early on in the book as someone who people walk all over.  I never got that impression.  She was the owner of her own business, and she was determined to help Cam's cousin Jamie.  She also happened to be a woman deeply in love with her husband.  It was her love and loyalty that Cam felt totally comfortable in betraying.  At one point late in the book, Allie asks Cam if he and Mia had laughed at her.  He tells her no.  However in a way, they did, considering they had no problem having sex in her flower shop and her bed.  I felt for Allie.  She deserved far better then Cam  I really wanted this book to be more about mercy killing and euthanasia.  Instead it was more about infidelity and how far a person is willing to go for someone they love.  Infidelity seems to be a pretty constant story line in most of Picoult's books (I understand her latest book, THE TENTH CIRCLE is no different.)  She is without a doubt an excellent writer, but this one just wasn't for me 
 The premise is great - man on a mission to save his long-lost love on a dying world - but the plot went downhill from there, at least for me, and the ending was completely unsatisfying. There was no real resolution, and what does the hero have left at the end? I didn't like his love interest at all, and she seemed vapor-brained to me - putting herself into a culture where she was essentially a sex slave to both her mate and his bondsman. Ick. George R.R. Martin is a brilliant writer, but this left me cold 
 The Gotan Project were going to perform in Sydney, Australia in January. I had never heard of them, but loving tango music, I decided to buy this recording to test the music before booking for the live performance. And what did I hear? An unimaginative electronic rhythm beat, recorded too loud in comparison with the rest of the instruments, a colourless female singer, an outstanding bandeneon player (whom you could hardly hear over the electronic beat), works that have hardly any tunes - just a change in harmonies, with frequent overtones of other tango composers. Terrible! The only 'reasonable' piece was the last one by Piazzolla from the film 'Sur' - but the performance by the male singer on the 'Sur' CD puts this the dull female to shame. Needless to say, I did not book for the live performance, and gave the CD away to a person I do not particularly like 
 I am surprised that the long list of acknowledgements did not include Dick Cavatte. I am only up to page 90, and already much of the book so far consists of Bette's interview with him from his show in the early '70's. If the reader was not aware, they would think that it was the author speaking to Bette, but it is the Cavatte chat show word for word. So far I am not very impressed, and I am glad that I got it from the library and did not buy it. To me the definitive biography is still Lawrence Quirk's "The Passionate Life of Bette Davis" 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 Mr. Lomas & company takes another crack at the Hiram Matrix, among the trilogy of Hiram books he has written [The Hiram Key] and [The Book of Hiram]being the other two, this one is not as good as "The Book of Hiram" however it is much better than the "Hiram Key". I guess it comes down to opinion and conjecture with a dash of conspiracy, at best. Maybe Mr. Lomas and company would like to tackle another aspect of Freemasonry, perhaps with better results. Two recommendations on the subject would be "African Origins of Freemasonry" (2005) by Zachary Gremillion and "The Huevolution of Sacred Muur Science Past and Present" (2005) by Noble Timothy Myers-El 
 The translation was impeccable it seemed, but I've NEVER enjoyed Homer's Odyssey. The book was bought as a class set and we used it in class for annotation of the text. Let me just say that it dragged on in some parts, but that wasn't the translator's fault, that was the WRITER'S fault. I just want to say that if you're interested in reading the Odyssey for PLEASURE: don't. The story drags on, it's filled with confusion and overall, the whole story is just stupid. If you're reading it for a CLASS: Then this is definitely a good pick. The easy-to-read format helps with jotting down precise line numbers, and the text is written in a simplistic format. However, again, I do not recommend this for choice reading. It's just boring, seriously. 
 Robert A. Heinlein, a leading writer of science fiction, wrote "A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method."  In Stranger in a Strange Land, we're introduced to a human who has magical powers simply by virtue of being raised on Mars. These powers, as of page 333, are not explained. There is hardly any conflict in story, and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion. Smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort. During negotiations, Smith's lawyer steamrolls the opposition. Most of the prose is spent on the author's pontification. At this point, I'm cutting my losses and shelving the book. I'm going back to Asimov to read some real SF 
     While I applaud Ms. Lawrence for educating fans on the gross injustices within the Hendrix family and for having a commendable understanding of Janie Hendrix's psychological make up that is lost even on many who are within her orbit, there are some very serious credibility problems here.       While even the idle Hendrix fan knows Jimi was born in King County Hospital, (Now Harbor View) Lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend.(Ouch) Jimi is quoted allegedly verbatum throughout the book but from some alledged tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that Lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so 'no one can profit from them'.Meanwhile cigarette packs (yes, cigarette packs) and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to private collectors allegedly having belonged to Hendrix ,siting Ms. Lawrence as the previous owner and source of authenticity.      At one point she aledgedly quotes Hendrix as saying:  "The LSD passed around San Francisco was a fabulous discovery for me, I'd taken acid in London but...."        Aside from Jimi's use of the word 'fabulous' being at best incredulous, the fact that Hendrix had already tried LSD in New York in 1996 before going to England and subsequently Monterey is common knowledge among afficianados and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes questionable. Those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews available through collectors, official releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book, and the credibility of it's author are based on, extremely suspect. At one point Ms. Lawrence even offers an aledged quote from Hendrix's mother who passed away in 1958:  "Jimi baby" she told her son "I have to escape this"     While quotes like this can illicit an emotional response   from the average reader,they are clearly  fictional. Throughout the book people close to Jimi are referenced but very sparsely quoted, if at all. I shared the recount of Jimi's trip to Berkeley as a small child (Pg.5) with Jimi's aunt Delores and she laughed openly and wondered aloud where people come up with these stories. This from a woman who was actually there and involved in planning said trip. While making a reference to Ernestine Benson and misstakenly referring to her husband Cornel  as "Bill" , Lawrence again allegedly quotes Hendrix in lieu of an actual interview with the Benson's who are both still living and have incredible first hand insights having lived with the Hendrix's.     Lawrence's assertion that Hendrix committed suicide simply because his journal was left out is no less ridiculous than Jimi's adopted stepsister Janie's claim that Jimi didn't OD.  Lawrence then stops just short of gleefully giving herself credit for Monika's suicide, but the jist is clear. This book is more than a bit narcissistic with Lawrence lauding herself as much as she does her subject. While proclaiming herself to be a close confident of Hendrix' the general consensus is that she wasn't around that much, if people even know who she is at all.    For a much more well researched and credible look into Jimi's life read Electric Gypsy or even more so , the new book Room Full Of Mirrors by Charles Cross. The Man, The Magic, The Truth, while very dramatic, is rife with glaring inaccuracies and is for the most part a novel about the author and her subject, not a biography or a reliable historical record. Unless these alledged tapes that are widely quoted throughout the entire book are made available, their legitimacy and the legitimacy of the book will forever be questioned.

 This movie set out to demonize the Weavers and did a great job of it. Far too many inaccuracies to even begin. While I understand the need to condense for the sake of a movie,this was too much. Saying this is based on the book"Every knee shall bow" is about like saying "Ben Hur" is based on the Bible 
 hi my name is alicia i am a high school senior and had to read this book i had to tell a summary and i could not how could i tell a summary of letters plays and her thoughts i needed help and if there is anyone out there  reading it for school i would not recommend you read it at all its good but  not that good to get a F fo 
 I enjoyed alot of the facts in this book and I really enjoyed the excerpts from FBI files and such, but I did not enjoy the main author.  This book has some real valid and promising advice, but the author injects himself into the book far too much.  This book seems less like advice and more like a publicity campaign for the author.  Co-authored by Diane Holloway Ph.D., who did alot of the research and I believe is responsible for the excerpts I did enjoy.  If you're a die-hard Detroit fan, then I say go ahead and get this book but be warned the author has a pretty crummy current view of the city that's unfair and biased especially since he doesn't live here anymore 
 A waste of money and time.Information so general that only a abolute beginner can use it.So called expert tips are common knowledge...tips for a succesful email...1 be responsive to customers tip2 be honest all times,tip3test tip4 have a good mailinglist tip4 have a good offer or quality product.... WELL WELL that's great news. This book is a recyling of the recycling of the recycling....You can easly see the book has been made in a few day 
 This film is a bunch of disjointed skits. Thy try too hard to be campy; however with not enough lead and no finish each disjointed sketch just leaves you wanting. There are a few made-up ersatz songs and Jayne Mansfield's accoutrements; aside from those everything else is flat.  There are a few personalities but they never shine: Phyllis Diller (fully clothed) Brian Donlevy (storms the beach) Jayne Mansfield (always points north) The Wild Ones (People Sure Act Strange)  The introductory song was the best part of the film.   A final thought "Love is a rose, but you better not pick it" 
 After reading the great reviews that Cuba was given, I thought I might give it a shot...i'm a true 'chick lit' lover. I was thoroughly disappointed! The story, drags on and on in a lackluster way. I found myself skimming through the pages just to get through them. I thought for sure there was something I was missing and that the story had to get better; I wasn't missing anything and it never got any better. It was unrealistic, boring and I couldn't wait for it to end...This was my first Emily Barr book, I'm afraid to judge on the first one, but I'd have to say I don't plan on reading anymore of her stuff anytime soon.. 
 Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one.  I'm not going to review the plot because it's been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English ("Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I'll pass.  I didn't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.     To add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn't make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of "...I would've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking..." or "...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking..." but I've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something.  Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I'd advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don't think he's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C'mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!    To reiterate, if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I'll take my top off and look in the mirror.  Who needs Mulholland Drive 
 To borrow the authors' own words...this book is a slippery piece of work.  You slip about and lose your footing.  It's nice and easy and clear and brilliant for many pages...then, you suddenly feel you've not been paying attention.  The author would say those periods are precisely the places you (the reader) have to identify as that is where the writer decides to add and hide things.  The book is VERY well written.  I learned a lot from the historical aspects of the novel.  There are four intersecting stories going on in this book and I think four separate EXCELLENT novels would have been a better arrangement. It does assist in telling you that 'I have to discover myself again'.  And it profoundly hints that success comes from a little good luck, talent, knowledge and prestige.  I also laughed when I read a line in the book: 'You are tormenting yourself needlessly' as that was how I felt at certain moments of reading this novel 
 The question titling this review is the one a potential reader needs to ask prior to choosing this book. The story of this astonishing work of art, gifted by Frederick I to Peter the Great, has been the basis for many books both scholarly and purely fictional. While this book is non-fiction it is not one I would recommend to anyone that is unfamiliar with this topic. The room that is the title of this book can be viewed online as it has been reconstructed, and once seen the viewer has a right to expect a written history of this fantastic creation that both approaches the unique beauty of the art itself and the incredible journey the room may have taken.  The mystery/history of the real Amber Room has all the makings of the most remarkable of fictional thrillers, and while the authors present a sturdy, competent narrative, the book never gets very interesting. The prose is dull and does as much of a disservice to the true tale that black and white photographs do to the real Amber Room.  The book also suffers from a constant handicap of; wishing for something just does not make it so, every attempt at breathless suspense reads as labored, contrived and often very predictable. If you have never read about this topic search elsewhere as the subject is fascinating, if you are already a reader of books on this tale again you should look further before adding this to your reading list. 
 In titling his book "The Post-Corporate World : Life After Capitalism," you'd think that the author would at least IMAGINE a world without corporations and without capitalism. He does not. He can not. He proceeds to knock the market economy, calling capitalism a cancer, but offers nothing to take its place. This book is only a compliation of his negative feelings about the world the way it is. Amazingly, his only meager suggestions are for people to buy from small businesses and to avoid buying from large corporations. He repeats over and over again throughout the book that capitalism is a cancer, as if repeating it would make it so... He seems to think that small businesses are not practicing capitalism, and that just .. 
 Despite having been a huge Who and Townshend fan for more than twenty years, I have never been able to listen to my LP copy of this album all the way through in one sitting. I finally bought a copy on CD for completion sake and gave it a whole listen. While it is better than I remembered, it is still a pretty mediocre affair.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the Scoop version of Don't Le go the Coat led to a new appreciation of this song. However, I prefer the Scoop version of that and You Better You Bet. Another Tricky Day is pretty good and Daily Records is an OK example of the kind of songwriting Pete was doing at this point (compare to Guitar and Pen on Who are You). I will be happy to never hear Cache Cache or How Can You Do It Alone again, however.   Finally, a correction to the review by Glenn Wall: John Entwistle, not Pete,  wrote Success Story from Who By Numbers. Still a great song 
 George Sluizer's original Dutch-French version of The Vanishing (aka The Man Who Wanted to Know) offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths, feeling his way one step at a time towards murder. If you've seen that version, you probably still can't get the final revelation out of your head, but the film had plenty more to offer than that, playing with chronology, subverting the usual cliches of its 'Lady Vanishes' plot (the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive) and throwing in some excellent characterization. I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered.  Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.'   But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame `let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment - best not go there... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.  
 This book is not worth purchasing if you have any knowledge whatsoever of the hotel industry. It attempts to cover too many topics in too little space and fails to penetrate the surface of any given issue. I think that it is probably too much to ask that an in depth analysis of an industry as diverse and complex as the hotel industry be compiled into a single volume 
 My mother in-law was actually responsible for Billy Milligan while he was in the Athens State hospital in Ohio.  I've had a chance to read this book, and although very good, what my mother-in-law tells me is much, much different.   She cared for him during his entire stay there.  She said that he had more psychology and parapsychology books in his room than she could have ever imagined.  She also said that his IQ was off the charts.  She believes (and she has a doctorate in psychology) he only has FOUR distinct personalities.  Raven being one of them.  Billy had the abilitiy and knowledge to manipulate his condition, making it appear much more severe.   Of course, she can't write anything about this, because Billy's publicist made everyone caring for him sign a waiver saying they wouldn't.  Yes... Billy Milligan has a publicist.   He also was a millionaire (because he exploited his disease) and drove a corvette on the weekends they let him go home.... yep... they let Billy Milligan have weekends.  This book is a very good interpretaion on what could possibly been going on in Billy's head.  However, after talking with someone who was actually there, and knew him well.... makes me second guess the validity of it 
 This bra is definately not for the over B cup set. The openings are too big and you'd be better off wearing nothin 
 The most interesting thing about this book is that the author feels no pressure to legitimize his assertion that there is something special about 30 seconds. Because his background is in the field of television entertainment, (never to be confused with communications), he finds significance in the length of television commercials, which frequently run 30 seconds. That this is done for financial reasons, not attention-span reasons, has evaded him completely. HTGYPAI3SOL is just another in the endless chain of How To books penned by individuals struggling with delusions of expertise, whose only skill is self-promotion, that package the obvious and resell it to the gullible. Readers who find anything in this slim and overpriced tome even remotely surprising or counter-intuitive are advised to probe deeper into the self-help section of the bookstore for volumes on Shoe-Tying For Beginners, The ABCs Of Writing Your Name, and Gravity - It's Not Just A Good Idea, It's The Law.  
 Beware:  Pampers Sensitive Wipes are not the same as "Pampers Sensitive"  -- the Pampers Sensitive Wipes contain citric acid, which can be an irritant, particularly for younger babies 
 Not recommended.  This allegedly "contrarian" book argues that the hot trends of the last 6 years (outperformance by small and value stocks) will continue for the next 20.  I find any argument for the continuation of well-established trends inherently suspicious, but purchased this anyway to challenge my notion (based on other sources, mostly Morningstar) that large growth is attractively valued right now (even if French & Fama are right about small & value being best in the long run).  I didn't find much to challenge my view.  The author's argument seems to be based entirely on reversion to mean, without any consideration of current valuations (P/E, Price/Book, Price/Sales) of the different market segments.  Two aspects raise the specter of data mining.  First, the reversion analysis is based entirely on 20-year rolling data, but the grounds for picking 20 are thin.  He says it's a typical holding period, but so are 10 and 25; I see no curiosity displayed whether the results would hold if different periods were used.  Second, the stock picking rules laid out in Chapter 8, singled out for praise by another reviewer, give the appearance of having been selected from thousands of possible rules.  I can't tell if these were previously published and have worked since then, but the backtesting is ALWAYS spectacular, and if enough rules were tried then the success of these was just random chance.  The author's portfolio recommendations are all domestic equity, and compared to a strawman historically bad allocation.  Bonds are ultimately dismissed, although the chapter devoted to them contains some good information.  REIT's, international investing, and commodities are skipped over in favor of advice to hire an advisor (which the author happens to be).  The chapter on asset allocation should thus be called "My domestic stock picks," and contains no analysis of the benefits of rebalancing volatile asset classes.  It's almost surely a mistake to own more than ~80% stocks, but you'd never know that from reading this book.    Another problem is the author's simultaneous praise at pp. 181 and 183-84 for the respective selection criteria of the Vanguard Value and Growth ETF's.  The MSCI indexes (on which these funds are based) are just the flip sides of a coin.  Of the 750 largest U.S. stocks, each index (and fund) contains only and exactly what the other does not.  Thus if one is good, the other is bad.  Ownership in both makes a simple cap-weighted index of the top 750 stocks (similar to  S&P 500 funds, which the author elsewhere condemns).  In fairness, there is some good information on the tech boom and bust, demographics, and 401(k)'s.  My bottom line, though, is that I got more out of both Richard Ferri's book on Asset Allocation, and William Bernstein's Four Pillars of Investing, even though it's out of date.    One final nit: IBM did not create the first laptop computer, in 1986, as stated on p. 242.  That was Data General, in 1984.  
 When it comes to looking for titles on catching and stringing along men one of the phrases women probably will not type into the search engine is 'The Satanic Witch' or a variation thereof. The phrase evokes images of Lucifer, hell and brimstone and is a good bit confusing for common folk. Looked at this way - and given the inverted pentagram and the runes on the cover how else would the untrained eye perceive this book? - the title is confusing or misleading. Those familiar with Anton LaVey's Satanism and the concepts put forth in The Satanic Bible may be more understanding. In spite of the protestations of the author and his cohorts the book indeed is about formula women ought to employ in their pursuit of men. In a book sure to incense traditional feminists everywhere LaVey advances the feminine look and form as legitimate means to beguiling men and advises on how to enchant, or bewitch if you wish, men with natural and unnatural assets. Central to the theme and the book are The LaVey Personality Synthesizer, with the majority and minority self, as well as The Law Of Forbidden. Political correctness is out of the door as LaVey uses his background in the circus, photography and Satanism to lecture on seduction and manipulation and in the process slag feminists, decorum, society, innocence and virtue. As dandy as all that is and as entertaining as the subject matter could be The Satanic Witch (originally published in 1970 as The Compleat Witch and also as What To Do When Virtue Fails) is really little more than LaVey's opinion and personal observations culled from a personal set of experiences. There are not any empirical data to back the book's conjectures. Much of the theorizations only make sense because they are a synthesis of the author's experiences mixed with the writings of others. The new edition of the book comes with a foreword by Peggy Nadrama the High Priestess Of The Church Of Satan and an Afterword by Blanche Barton, the mother of LaVey's daughter, which add value to the book by personalizing the tome and adding historical information and context regarding the deceased founder of The Church Of Satan 
  I should first state that I am a huge EJ fan. His music has been extremely important to me over the years. He is, without a doubt, a genius ... I would go so far as to call him the Mozart of our times.  But, Elton can also write bloated, self-indulgent tripe, and if you ask me, this album belongs in that bucket. I give it 2 stars just because of SSMLT, one of his all-time greats. I never cease to be blown away by that song. But the rest of this album? Booooooring!!! 
 De Soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights: it's incredibly difficult for poor people (specifically, recent urban migrants) to get legal title to their land. As a result, the poor make "extralegal" arrangements, squatting on and using land that neighbors (but not the government) recognize as theirs. But because they don't own the land, they can't get a mortgage on their house to start a business, electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services, the government has difficulty taxing them because they don't have a legal address, and so on. And so on.  It's a very important point but de Soto oversells, arguing with exaggerated (and oft-repeated) ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor.   He occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work. For example, he has helped businesses in Peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal, and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes: a useful bit of empirical information, but those gems appear all too occasionally.  Before reading this entire book, I recommend going to the website of de Soto's foundation (the Institute for Liberty and Democracy at www.ild.org.pe) and reading the main point there (in one tenth the words) 
 The book basically covers three subjects.  First, a political and historical background of Iraq and Saddam - Excellent.  Besides the history primer, Mr. Keegan also has some thought provoking, if negative,  remarks about Islam (or at least some of its variants) which I may research later.      Second, the events leading to the second gulf war - Poor at best.  I agree that Saddam had to go, preferably sooner than later.  Failing any political progress, war was a likely outcome.  Having terrorized his citizens, started two major wars and having a record of NBC/WMD weapons research he wasn't someone anyone felt comfortable having around.  The UN embargo wasn't working and medical/food shortages were killing up to 50.000 civilians a year, according to some pre-war estimates.  Mr. Keegan jumps firmly, but clumsily, into the pro-war bandwagon.  The issue of missing WMD is never really addressed very well.  Did the Western intelligence agencies really drop the ball?  Or did the US and the UK lie to their citizens in order to drum up support for an unpopular military intervention?  If it wasn't a lie, could the intelligence agencies have done any better?  If not, what lessons to learn from that?  His characterization of opponents to the war is lame.  Mr. Chirac?  "A braggart".  Europeans? "idealistic Olympians who do not recognize the need for force".  And so on...  Now, I dislike Chirac myself. But a skilled author owes his readers some balance and, especially, more justifications.  The French do have a long and shameful history in Iraq.  Selling weapons.  Having their defence minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, refer to Saddam as "a new Napoleon" (which is praise, in France at least) after 1988.  Looking happily to the end of sanctions to sell more stuff in an area without US competition.  Given all that, France deserves criticism, but Mr. Keegan doesn't bother to argue his case by mentioning any of it.  The BBC also gets nailed for its "biased coverage", again without any arguments to support that position.  Personally, I rather liked their coverage and thought its bias less visible than Keegan's.  And, no, I don't think that hoping for a future without wars is silly.  It might not work out, and sometimes (Rwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia) it is better to go to war after all.  It is necessary to resist dictatorships such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.  But you can't fault pacifism as being only for silly idealists.  It has, for now, all but stopped wars among Western nations and it has instilled a healthy distrust of "colonial interventions" by most of those nations' citizens.   Third - the war itself - Not all that great.  There is some high level analysis of what units were moving where, and what they did.  Some coverage of local action, plenty of other interesting stuff.  Keegan is in in element here.    What there isn't is any interviews of Iraqis.  Or any detailed info on Iraqi activity during the war. No Iraqi is mentioned by name outside the usual suspects covered by CNN.  Everything is from the Allies' viewpoint.  I don't blame Mr. Keegan for staying out of Iraq right now.  But it makes you wish that the book was written ten years from now, with Keegan having been able to do his usual world class research.  Nor is there any analysis of how the US should face the Iraq insurgency, despite the 2005 addition to the book.  With current events being what they are, we need people like Mr. Keegan to reinvent themselves as analysts of low-level, guerilla warfare, terrorism, etc...    But this book is more informative about the perils of writing history books too soon, before the facts emerge fully 
 Murkoff is an ok writer, but everything is too precious.  He's got some dark characters and a little rough subject matter, but this book tries too hard.  Too many perfect descriptions and metaphors.  I feel like he's trying to impress instead of creating something from the heart.  I got about halfway through and I had put it down before I puked.  Too bad I didn't get to the dam part, but oh well, must look after my health 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I think this book fails to supply the most important information to those with fibromyalgia. It makes the dissorder seem so mysterious, when it is not. Much is known about FM that this book skims over or doesn't mention. Sleep is the major component to FM, because of a deficiency of serotonin, preventing us from getting delta sleep, the restorative sleep that revitalizes energy, and heals/relaxes muscles. Check out "Fibromyalgia" by Daniel J. Wallace. That does a much better job 
 The right wing does not make any sense.  How does ignoring scientific evidence, denying people their constitutional rights, and having a very narrow view on issues such as abortion improve our society?  Leave our country alone 
 This is just a REALLY bad book.  First I blame James Patterson, but I really REALLY blame his editor.  What editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published?    The villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains.  Just - over the top. The plot line is unbelievable.  Aside from Alex Cross and the two villains, nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever.  Alex Cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the FBI to foil the villains.  This is supposed to be one of those "the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world" type thriller but - there's no sense of urgency, and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched, and inept (but not deliberately written that way).  I could go on and on but it's not worth the words.  This book is REALLY a waste of time.  I can't believe anybody published it 
 I picked this book up after after enjoying "Savage Pastimes," another book by the same author, and hoped for an informative and gruesome book about an infamous serial killer.  "Depraved" was, in places, but the presentation was lacking, and the book had no focus and far too much irrelevant courtroom drama.  It opens up properly, with a thumbnail sketch of the times, H. H. Howard's infamous crimes, and more background info. It then lists some formative experiences from his childhood, and gives a short bio of his life up to the point he turned to murder. After that it loses its way though, with endless discussion of Holmes' travels around the country as he tries to perpetrate a minor insurance scam, and then far too many pages on his murder trail. Surprisingly, his trial is for the murder of a henchmen in an insurance scam, and he's never charged or prosecuted for the dozens of other far more interesting murders he committed. Unfortunately those are hardly mentioned in the book at all, and are not discussed in any detail.  Going by the middle 80% of the book, you'd think it was a biography about a small time hustler, scam artist, and bigamist who eventually got carried away and murdered a partner, and was subsequently tried and executed for it. The fact that he killed maybe 50 other people, built this incredible murder mansion, tortured dozens of people, and was the world's first documented serial killer, is almost an afterthought.  Let's be honest; the hook of the book, the reason anyone reads it, is that it's about H. H. Holmes, who killed a lot of people in various horrible ways, at a time in history when that sort of thing was almost completely unknown. That's' what the reader wants to know about, in as much detail as possible, with lots more about the, "mazelike corridors, soundproof rooms, sealed vaults, oversized furnaces, and chutes leading down to the cellar" that the book jacket talks about. Unfortunately, you get hardly more detail about those things than the book jacket says, with no detailed descriptions of anything, no charts or diagrams or photographs, no eyewitness accounts, and not even any speculation about how the crimes went down.  What you do get are maybe 200 pages (out of the 360 total) covering his seemingly endless and aimless cross-country travels while dodging the cops and tediously plotting to murder his assistant in a life insurance scam, hoodwink his widow, and dispose of the guy's children.  Ten or fifteen pages would have been sufficient for that section, but instead it covers at least 100, most of it of the, "traveled from Chicago to Baltimore, checked into two different hotels under different names, didn't buy the poor girls new shoes, etc..." variety. It's as boring as it sounds from my summary.  Worse yet, we then revisit that entire story when it all gets relived during Holmes' trial, which ends in his conviction for the murder of his henchmen, as part of a life insurance scam.  The author covered that section in so much detail for an obvious reason; he could just pluck it all from newspaper articles at the time, since there was extensive coverage of Holmes in the media of the day. Far, far less coverage is given to the castle itself, or Holmes' serial killing, and there's virtually nothing about why Holmes became what he was. We get one short childhood incident, lots of unsourced comments about his practicing torture on animals as a child, and then bang, he's being hung for one minor murder with almost no details about the bulk of his crimes. We know everything about a crime we don't much care about, and almost nothing about all of the crimes we wanted to learn about, and that's a definite flaw. I was skimming paragraphs and whole chapters by page 250 or so; bored with the irrelevant courtroom drama and wanting to get past his conviction for one life insurance scam murder, and on to more about his real crimes.  Basically this is a decent first draft of a book about H. H. Holmes, but it needs substantial editing to add detail about his castle and murders, needs to have at least 50 pages of redundant and boring reportage about his travels removed, and needs much more psychological analysis and discussion about Holmes and the society in which he lived.  My final, seldom-used non fiction scores:  Concept: 7 Presentation: 4 Writing Quality: 5 Presents/Explains the Topic Clearly: 5 Entertainment Value: 4 Rereadability: 3 Overall: 3. 
 I bought this headset from retailer (offline), and returned it the next day. First off, I have to make it clear that I had NO problems with sound. Even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers), the sound quality of the headset was just fine.  However, when it comes to wearing these headphones, the only words that come to mind are "uncomfortable as sin". The awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). Also, I have no idea what material they used for the cup pads, but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact, I litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. Mind you, I also own a cheap pair of Koss headphones I can keep on for hours at a time, so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things, they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time, which isn't good at all. Discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return.   If your ears are tough, you should have no problem with this headset. The sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. However, if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation, you'll want to look elsewhere.. 
 Oh, please SPARE US the histrionics, Sanchez! Sanchez was only peripherially involved with the Stones about the time Brian got screwy & died, and then on the '69 tour...as "security."  Yeah, that's him in "Gimmie Shelter," when Mick and Keith are dancing around in their hotel room to "Brown Sugar" - he's the one that scowls so prettily when one of the Maysles sticks a light meter in his face. HA-ha: if THIS twit was responsible for "security," we all oughta be grateful that it was only Meredith Hunter that got snuffed at Altamont. This pedantic "book" reads something like a bad Beavis & Butthead fantasy, i.e, "well, then Keith got high, so I made it with ----(Marianne, Anita, take your pick)" Man, your fifteen minutes are LONG GONE with that vignette in "Gimmie Shelter."  Go whine some more to your fellow sufferers in rehab or something...we've read ALL these silly little stories by third-rate hangers-on before!  And in most cases, MUCH better, more coherently written, too 
 I didn't know a whole alot about Blancmange when I decided to purchase this album. I had seen the "Living On The Ceiling" music video on an 80'sMTV channel & heard "Don't Tell Me" on satellite radio. I'd figure this collection would be to my liking, but I was disappointed. Alot of the tracks weren't memorable or catchy. "God's Kitchen", "I've Seen The Word" & "Feel Me" are good songs, they have that Talking Heads vibe to them. I'm not sorry I purchased this album, for I enjoyed a small percentage of these songs 
 would you buy a used contra from this man?  Newt, genocidal maniac against brave little Nicaragua in the Eighties, driven from DC in disgrace, now wants to be our President and so comes up with this self-serving and shamelessly hypocritical piece of electioneering and political campaigning.  Newsflash: GOd does NOT approve of Newt.  Newt takes us like a pervert uncle pointing out the word God on monuments around the NAtional Mall. But Newt's policies and practices have denied and ignored the meaning of these very words there inscribed.  GOd said Thou Shalt Not Kill. Newt's dirty little wars from the eighties onwards have killed uncounted thousands of innocent people worlwide.  Newt is a shameless liar now to claim the mighty name of God, and has much to answer for.  For a more true theologian and truly prayerful Christian reading, please consult with the Reverend John Dear, SJ, in particular his Disarming the Heart, and the God of Peace.  Leave Newt for the gullible and eagerly deceived. Newt is an apocalyptic false prophet spitting toads. Nothing more. Trying to get back into national office the most shameless way. 
 This book was not up to my expectations. Maybe I understood this introduction wrong- I hoped to find some hints to find great employees and some new ideas. Instead I read many times, that it is important to hire great employees and that they are not easy to find. To my opininon it is more like a childrens book, than for the adults. I am not a manager, but I read nothing new, instead I understood, that we are doing things ok already in our company. In real world things are not so easy and simple as in this book. At least not in Estonia, people are bit smarter. Some of the titles in this book were  longer that the chapters itself, I was lucky to get one good sentence per chapter 
 Melissa was just an average gossip reporter for a NYC newspaper looking for love in all the wrong places.  Fortunately her elderly next door neighbor was attacked in her home and left for Mel to find unconscious and barely breathing.  Mel, being the kind, neighborly girl she is, took to taking care of the woman's pets and set to getting in contact with her only living relative.  Her heinous, photographer nephew, Max.  After hearing of his aunt's accident, Max decided it was more important to spend a few weeks in Florida with a supermodel.  In his place, he sent an old college friend who owed him a favor.  John Trent, a trust fund millionaire, was called in to stay at Max's house and pretend to be Max.  After spending time together Mel and "Max" begin to fall i love, creating quite a mix up.  All in all it's a cute book, but I hate that the entire book consists of correspondance through emails 
 I always judge music, not by the first few auditions, but whether or not I listen to it in the future.  As in the case with Tosca's latest release, Dehli9, a year after I bought it, it is gathering dust.  This does not detract from the quality production value and the sheer talents of D&H (Dorfmeister and Huber).  However, I am still listening to Tosca's masterpiece, Suzuki, on a regular basis for the past 5 years.  I expected Dehli9 to be another graceful yet complex work but after the first few listens, I was bored with the music.  Most tracks are nothing more than lounged-out versions of deep house music.  Me and Yoko Ono is particularly irritating (and don't get me started on the repetitive vocals).  This piece would be better served as an instrumental.  Wonderful, one of the strongest tracks, still has a jazzy, commercial feel to it, almost like it belongs in a shampoo commercial.  This CD is not the blunted, abstract music we have come to love from Tosca.  I thought the 2nd CD would be bonus, unreleased tracks or a "Dehli9 remixed" EP.  Alas, I was again disappointed by discovering this was a collection of Rupert Huber's experiments on the piano.  Honestly, the music was quasi-nighmarish...better suited on a Silent Hill or Resident Evil game soundtrack.  I have only played CD2 once, never to grace my player again.  In all fairness, this would be a good work to educate the uninitiated to the world of lounge, downtempo and trip-hop.  However, you would be better served by skipping this uninspired work and head to the good stuff, like Suzuki and Opera.  Hey, even the Honey EP gets better marks!  Maybe there will be a "Dehli9 in Dub" in the future?  It can't be any worse than the original...or can it? 
 I found this book to be extremely hard to follow as it was more of a fluffed up marshmellow than actually fact or theory based. What I found much easier to follow was one by M. R. Franks titled The Universe and Multiple Reality 
 I picked this book up with the intention of reading it with an open mind. I honestly wanted to hear the arguements for Intelligent Design. Carrying only a Bachelors in Biology I became aware just a few pages in that what I was reading was not science, by any stretch of the imagination.   People in Behe's corner are complaining that the scientific community is not giving this information a fair shot, then apparently don't listen as they very clearly refute it as bad science. Here is the refute that you are asking for, please try to read it:   The book speaks as complicated as possible, to make you feel that nothing so complicated could ever happen naturally. I can honestly say that I do not fully understand blood clotting at an obcene micro-scale. But what I understand about evolution (99% of people in the world don't really understand evolution) quickly debunks everything this man has to say when he says something 'couldn't have happened.'  For instance: his case of the mousetrap being IC. Evolution is a passive process. No one wanted to make an eye. No one wanted to make a foot, a finger, or a liver. You can't start an arguement in that direction when discussing evolution, because it doesn't work that way.   Someone designed a mousetrap to catch mice. Yes, it was certainly an intelligent designer that did so. So he's already comparing evolution,a passive process, to something that actually HAD an intelligent designer; ie. the person who had too many mice in his house (or her house).  His book is full of analogies like this that are just not appropriate to the topic. Please just take some time to learn the very fundamentals of evolution. Then, go on to see all the facts that have have come to light since Darwin's time (please see DNA, viral mutations and resistance). I actually tell my students its as if Darwin used a time machine to come to the future and stole a textbook about DNA then went back in time with his new theory. All scientific research since Darwins time was not looked at to coincide with evolution. But the facts don't lie.  Make sure you truly understand what evolution is all about. Then go back and read Behe's book. Then maybe you'll understand where the scientific community is coming from.  2 stars for controversy; It's about time the scientific community had a good place to start teaching the people about the world they live in.  One last piece - Evolution does not destroy God. It doesn't have to be one way or the other. Go learn about evolution and you'll understand why! 
 This book tries to establish a relationship between your frame of mind and your ability to conceive.  While stress may not help your chances I do not believe that somehow something in your past blocks an egg from being fertilised just like that.  No evidence is provided that this happens.  There are plenty of people with trauma and unhappy backgrounds who have had no problems in bearing children.  There are also plenty of people who are well balanced, have had happy marriages and childhoods who have difficulty in conceiving.  I felt that in a subtle way this book encourages people toward self blame and encourages a mentality that you can make it happen if you really want to.  This is not always the case, sometimes despite all efforts by all concerned it just doesn't happen.    In most of the client cases in the book the female solves her emotional baggage and then just gets pregnant.  Get real.  I much prefer "Conquering Infertility" by Alice Domar.  I feel this book is much more substantiated, more realistic in recognising that it may not happen but uses the mind body approach to manage the inevitable stress of fertility treatment.  
 If you child is not eating by mouth but by tube installed in his(her) body usually tummy then this book is just right for you. I have a 4 yr old food refuser and bought this book , first to make her eat , second to widen her food choice.  Author used so difficult language mostly related to feeding tubed children. Not worth to buy , if you child has no physical problems.  
 Jill McCorkle seems to be trying too hard to be unique and quirky just for the sake of being "original." I was attracted to this book because I like fiction written from the point of view of many characters, but "Carolina Moon" was an amalgam of too many different styles that just wouldn't blend. We have letters, we have third person narration, and we have first person narration in the form of an annoying young woman talking to a tape recorder diary. Too much.  This last narration bothered me because the woman didn't sound like she was talking to a tape recorder - the voice sounds more like a written voice. For example, she barely distinguishes who's speaking, which is fine on the page where you can see indents and paragraphs and quotation marks, but as a spoken voice it didn't work. She didn't sound like a real person. The point of having someone tell his or her story through a tape recorder diary is to capture his/her voice more naturally. McCorkle just tells the story this way because it's "neat." The character doesn't sound any different from any of the other characters - and her story is pointless and contributes nothing to the plot or sublot or second subplot.  Quee was just plain annoying. She's an old, quirky prostitute medicine woman who collects pictures of people she doesn't know and makes stories up about them. She was quirky and had a quirky perspective on morals, so we're supposed to like her. I hated her. I'm tired of fiction about crazy, quirky people trying to force their agendas down our throats. The best novel I've read about a quirky person was "A Separate Peace" because the narrator in that novel gets just as annoyed at the quirky character as the reader. (And he pushes him out of a tree.) Read that book instead.  I think McCorkle may just have been suffering from some quirkiness herself when she wrote this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the stories are bland. There's no reason for the unnamed woman to drop letters to her dead lover in the mailbox except to advance the story. And the only purpose the mailman has is to read the letters to us. The characters are more like the author's pawns than real people. The book didn't really seem to be about anything, and the ending was unbelievable (in a bad way, not a good way). I was surprised because McCorkle is usually a very good character writer. Her short story "Intervention" is a marvelous story about a woman torn between her alcoholic husband and her children, who wish to have an intervention. Great character in that story. I'd recommend reading McCorkle's short stories instead of "Carolina Moon." 
 SUMMARY: Adaptor could create interference if used with AM radios; acceptable for CD, MP3, or other non-radio applications. The 2-Star rating applies to use with radios only (not recommended)  EVALUATION: The AC adaptor is typically presented as a "better together" purchase recommendation for Sony's ICF-M410V Portable FM/AM/TV/Weather Radio. However, information on the adaptor's package specifically states that the adaptor is NOT recommended for use with radios due to potential interference. The (unstated) reason for this is that the power supply in the adaptor is a switching supply which creates interference, particularly for AM signals.  The adaptor should work with CD or MP3 players without any problems, as this is the intended application.  NOTE: I am basing this recommendation on the information Sony provides on the package. I have NOT tried it (I returned the adaptor unopened to Amazon for refund) 
 I read this a few years back, but I still remember it well for being the first book I couldn't bring myself to finish. I read about 100 pages, which took me over a month, after which I sat down and pondered whether the plot or characters actually justified going on reading. The book had its moments, but I found it to lack direction.  The language is absolutely excruciating. Some sentences are almost a page long, and just littered with commas, parentheses, strange use of colons, or all of the above. Often a sentence could begin with a story of something, then trailing off to a sub-story of that item, then trailing off to a sub-sub-story of the sub-story before going back to the sub-story, maybe to another sub-sub-story and back to the sub-story, and finally back again to the story where the sentence started. When you constantly have to go back half a page to remind yourself how the damn sentence STARTED, it's more frustrating than fun to read. I suppose Faulkner was going for some stream-of-consciousness approach, which I can safely say is not my cup of Scotch.  I should point out that I am an experienced reader and that I read it in my native tongue. Maybe the translator did a hack job, I have no idea. I only know it was a thoroughly painful read and I felt relieved to ditch it and move on. A book is NOT well written just because it's "difficult".  Of course, he won the Nobel prize, so what do I know 
 ...but it stopped working after a year. The only thing the lens sees now is black, although the camera still turns on and I can look at pictures I took before the problem started. Nonetheless, I loved this camera, and I think it was worth it, even though it only worked a year. Now I've learned my lesson and will buy a longer warranty or exchange for m new camera 
 I wouldn't recommended this workout DVD to anyone! There was way too much chit-chat and it was very difficult to follow the three instructors. I've had this DVD for less than two weeks and sold it in a local pawn shop for $2 
 Enjoyed Leary's Rescue Me and The Job so much but was really disappointed in his stand up - not funny and over done 
 As a diehard Red Sox fan, how could I go wrong with a book documenting the 2004 season?  The answer:  Stephen O'Nan.  He spends more time espousing outrageous conspiracy theories (that MLB is routinely fixing games to get postseason matchups) making up silly nicknames for players that no one else on the planet uses, and generally spouting personal anecdotes that do not provide any insight or even useful description of the famed season.  Stephen King, on the other hand, does a terrific job.  Unfortunately it is O'Nan who provides the bulk of the content.  As a committed baseball fan I routinely found O'Nan's lack of understanding of the subtleties of the game to be infuriating.  Basically this guys is not qualified to be writing any sort of non-fiction book about the sport.  That said, there is one redeeming aspect (in addition to Stephen King's portions) to the book.  It brought back that wonderful season - as I plowed through, I remembered where I was and what I was doing at each critical juncture.  I remebered the anguish and the joy - conjured back by the images in the book.  Worth reading?  I think so - though I reccomend the strategy of keeping the book out and picking a chapter randomly every now and again.  This allows you to re-live the moments with small doses of O'Nan's idiocy 
 First, I loved the idea of this book--a compendum of the more significant mathematical breakthroughs in all their detail, as written by their creators. The text is refreshing in that it is not a watered down version of someone's results. I have a math background and all the details are appreciated. There's something about reading the original text, straight from the minds of these great men.  This book could be useful, for example, for someone who likes math and wants a 'sampler' of different areas of study. It could also be useful for someone reading up on the history of mathematics who wants to dig deeper into certain areas and see the original works.  All that said, I have to agree with another reviewer about the editing. It's awful (yes, awful) that such typographical errors could exist in a math book. The first section I looked at in this book, Riemann's original paper on the zeta function, had four typos ON THE SAME PAGE. This is disasterous to someone trying to learn the material for the first time, or someone trying to follow a tight line of argument. If this was a college text book, I'd probably burn it, because learning math is difficult enough, without having to contend with typos. To the editors of this book: COME ON GUYS, YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED (YES, ASHAMED) OF YOURSELVES (you're just COPYING something someone else wrote--and yet you managed to mess that up)! At least put an errata page somewhere online 
 Only John Kerry would allow a book like this to be printed about himself. John Kerry, the guy who tried to get out of going into the service on a deferrment and when that was denied pulled every lowdown, dirty trick he could come up with including applying for fake Purple Hearts so he could get out early, go home, run a phony anti-war campaign and then run for President.  The biggest insult of all was at the DNC back on July, 2004 when Kerry made that phony salute and  said "I'm John Kerry reporting for duty." 34 years earlier, Kerry was singing quite a different tune.  More like "I'm John Kerry trying to get out of the service on a deferrment." OR "I'm John Kerry trying to rack up phony Purple Hearts from self inflicted and minor scrapes so I can get the heck out of here and go home."  As if Kerry's military background was not a myth, we now all know that his supposed academic prowess was also a myth. While Kerry claimed to be an A student, in fact he was a D student. And that great speech that he made in 1971, supposedly prepared by Kerry in the wee morning hours with little preparation was in fact written for him by Robert Kennedy's speechwriter who had been coaching Kerry for months. But why be surprised? Has Kerry ever told us the truth about anything? Answer: No!  What happened to that big draft Kerry said was coming for sure in January 2005? And how about those reduced social security benefits for our seniors that republicans were supposed to  install according to inside information that Kerry had? Looks like the only draft is between Kerry's ears and just last week our seniors got the second biggest raise on their social security benefits since Bush I was president and raised benefits back in 1991.  So is Kerry misinformed or just a flat out liar? Check out the heroic military image that he created for himself. Does that tell you something? It's not rocket science.  
 I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back 
 ANANSI BOYS by Neil Gaiman Review by Nickolas Cook  	For those familiar with Gaiman's past work, like me, you've probably come to appreciate his intelligent humor, story telling ï¿½lan, and philosophical bent on the human condition.  With "Anansi Boys" he again proves all of those qualities and more. 'Fat' Charlie Nancy is the disgruntled son of the forgotten African god, Anansi (we met him in Gaiman's masterpiece to date, "American Gods"), a mischievous spider deity, who stole all of the stories of creation from Tiger, the dark and violent god of blood and death.  'Fat' Charlie receives news that his father has passed away and rushes from England to Florida to find his father was no mere human.  And as if that's not bad enough to ruin his day, he also discovers he's got a lost brother called Spider.  Given the incantation to draw his brother to him by a trio of old hags, much like MacBeth's cackling witches, he gets more than he bargained for when his impishly suave brother appears and begins to steal his life, his career, and his fiancï¿½ right out from under him. Gaiman does mythology like no other author, dragging us from one world to the next in search of honor and love, making the cosmic drama of gods more human.  But what he does even better is examine familial love and commitment to a calling higher than one's self.  For 'Fat' Charlie soon finds that he can't ignore his heritage anymore than he can his brother.  He is part of the pantheon, whether he fancies it or not, and, after a bargain made in angry frustration, must battle to save his bloodline from eternal death. Gaiman's prose is top notch, fast paced, edited to the essentials, with enough descriptive passages to make the story blossom in full, but not enough to stifle the pace.  There are some rather out of place scenes with the spirit of a murdered woman that tend to dishevel the almost perfect fairytale quality of the story, but given that all's well that end's well, it can be forgiven. "Anansi Boys" doesn't have anywhere near the broad canvas feel of "American Gods" and the extraordinary "Neverwhere", but fits nicely along side his "Stardust".  It's a fun read, full of humor and great characters, but his fans may miss that mythical cosmic sense provided by  some of his other fiction.  --Nickolas Cook 
 Congratulations are in order to the authors of Mavericks of the Sky.  Barry Rosenberg and Catherine Macaulay managed to create a story, almost three hundred pages, about the beginnings of air mail in the United States that could have been all summed up in their thirty page epilogue.  Rosenberg and Macaulay, at first, seem to be well proven authors with many successful publications under their belts.  Both have published work for publications such as Aviation Week & Space Technology, E/The Environment Magazine, and the Daily Racing Forum.  It is important to remember that looks can be deceiving.   Webster's Dictionary defines Maverick as a person or individual that does not get along well with others.  It is quite odd that that Rosenberg and Macaulay would title their work and label the founding men of aviation and air mail as "Mavericks", but maybe the name was stolen from Top Gun.  The book basically sums up the stories of the early pioneers of aviation that led to the formation of air mail and the airlines as we know them today.  It is quite amazing that a topic of such interest could be told in such a confusing and unprofessional manner as Rosenberg and Macaulay demonstrated. 	Mavericks of the Sky begins with the ill famous story of Major Reuben Hollis Fleet, and his tedious role in the formation of the air mail service.  The book continues with the story of Major Fleet and introduces numerous amounts of characters that some how had a role in early air mail service.  The authors present a story that would be quite sufficient for the average 7th grader, but not for anyone who has the slightest inclination about the overwhelming amount of information that should be told about the pioneers of the air mail service.   Rosenberg and Macaulay are successful in telling the story of the air mail service as much like a comedy skit off of Saturday Night Live.  Both continually change from the tone of a scholarly author to that of one that seems to be writing an episode of Seinfeld.  It is easy to spot numerous examples throughout the book where both authors  display a carefree attitude in the telling of an incident, and the average reader loses the historical meaning of the incident, because they become caught up in a joke.  The authors may simply be meaning to poke harmlessly at the mishaps of these early pioneers, but it is suggested that they stick to a more serious attitude when discussing men who lost their lives day in and day out to further a dream.   The epilogue of this book was much more beneficial that reading the story itself.  Information was presented better and more organized than through the twenty something chapters in Mavericks of the Sky.  The epilogue simply shortened all the various stories presented throughout the book and got right to the point instead of a bunch of ad lib.   Rosenberg and Macaulay deserve much credit on the pictures contained in the book, because they give the book much more character.  It is easy to gain a lot of understanding of what early aviation was like by flipping through the pictures contained within this book, but it is sad that neither author can take credit for these pictures.  Pictures make a book very personnel and these deliver the wide array of attitudes presented by these  men and women just be looking into their eyes.   This book is a great recommendation for anyone interested in a quick read with little information.  Mavericks of the Sky, is very selective in the stories it tells about the formation and development of the air mail service in the United States.  If the reader desires to have a more detailed understanding of these pioneers and their stories, it is recommended that this book be passed up and one chosen by someone who actually can write a historical work of non-fiction! 	     
 I am an avid reader, I got this book for free, and I'm glad I did.  I found her "tales" self absorbed and she came across as unlikable, not what she was trying to do I'm sure. I could see why men leave her or don't call her. Her desire to be an actress never clicked , and it did make me think about how many people waste their lives trying to get steady work as an actor. As a women, I found her irritating, and as a reader I found myself getting real bored about halfway into the book. The story I think she has in her to tell, is the one about her real Dad. That was interesting. ( but did she make up that part on how she finally met him??, that seemed fake)  She is on firmer ground as a writer when discussing her family. I think her dating/relationship problems stem from her issues with her real Dad. (who abandoned her mother and her when she was 4) (like some stranger pop analyzing helps!) Anyway, at least she wrote a book and got it published, and that is huge, so Congratulations to you Laurie! I would be interested in a true story about your family. : 
 I purchased this product and much to my amazement, the dual controls are installed backwards!The control with the service label information is supposed to operate the right side of the bed, the unlabeled control is supposed to operate the left side of the bed. Not so. My side of the bed was too hot, hubby's side was too cold. When we swapped the controls to the opposite of what the directions said, we had the desired results. I purchased this product during the winter months, and needed it too much to send it back to the factory.....at my expense....for repair or replacement. Make sure any electric blanket or warming pad you purchase has at least a 5 year guaranty 
 Disclaimer:  I have only been able to sample Professor Butz's work.  I looked at those portions of particular interest to me.  I read what he had to say about Jewish demographics, that is, the number of Jews in Europe before and after the Second World War.  I also looked at what he had to say about the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, at which the Germans, according to the standard historians, decided on the Holocaust. I was also interested to see how he evaluated the Nuremberg trials of the top Nazi leaders.    On population figures, Professor Butz will not accept any data from Jewish or "Communist" (i.,e. Soviet) sources, since, he says, such sources are tainted.  Jews and Communist lie, according to Professor Butz, so why listen to them.  On the Wannsee Conference, he quotes the Nazi sources that speak of Nazi plans to deport all of Europe's Jews and to enslave them.  But since these Nazis did not spell out an intention to kill all Jews in so many words, Professor Butz finds that, therefore,  this source is reliable evidence for his proposition that no such killings took place.  In Professor Butz's book, moreover,  whoever says that he has witnessed the Holocaust is a liar.    On the Nuremberg trials, he finds that any incriminating statements by Nazis to have been extorted by cruel and sadistic Allied guards.  Professor Butz's work gives evidence of great industriousness.  He has many footnotes and supplies many figures and pictures.  Such apparatus has been taken as a sign of deep scholarship by his friends and supporters.  But his analysis of all these data is simple:  whatever supports his thesis is accepted, whatever contradicts it is called a lie.  But unfortunately for Professor Butz,  it is quite impossible to accept his thesis without also accepting his notion of the Jews.  He sees Jews of all stripes -- from the most Zionist to folks like Noam Chomsky -- as united in a vast conspiracy to dupe the non-Jewish world.  Moreover, in order to accept Professor Butz's work, we must also accept that this Jewish conspiracy, this "Hoax" as he calls it, was also uncritically accepted by all the professional historians who have worked in this area.  Everyone is a dupe, everyone, that is, except he himself and his handful of friends.    Is that plausible ?  I don't think so.  
 Antzcak's direction is inexplicable and the film is weighed down by a directionless, melodramatic script and technical shortcomings. The ADR (dialog overdubbing) is incompetent and terribly distracting, making the film sound like a radio drama recorded in a basement; all the more odd considering that in all other respects the project seems well-funded and professional -- great sets, superior costuming and impeccable lighting. The gorgeous cinematography is brutalized by a directorial style characterized by long, tedious dialog punctuated by frenetic, fast-cut flashback and dream sequences that contribute neither to our understanding of Chopin's character nor the events driving the plot forward. Non-sequiturs abound; Antzcak seems to have been attempting to create a mood piece to accompany the brilliant musical performances, rather than a sustained narrative. But the only moods sustained are bewilderment and boredom.  Chopin comes off as a selfish boor of a prima dona; perhaps historically acurate, but hardly compelling on screen. What does it say about this movie that, in a crucial scene where a wagon carrying Chopin nearly topples over a precipice, you find yourself rooting for the precipice?  Unlike the vastly superior Amedeus or the merely pedestrian Immortal Beloved, you learn nothing about the connection between the composer's life and his music. Antzack seems singularly uninterested in the historical signifigance of Chopin's acheivement, the nature of his talent's development, his freindship/rivalry with Liszt, or the musical environment of the day. Desire for Love actually has more in common with a film like Jules et Jim, in that it dwells on the inner dynamics of a doomed and disfunctional romance; unfortunately the characters aren't one tenth as compelling or sympathetic.  Desire for Love ends with the composer's protracted death, like Amadeus and Immortal Beloved did with Mozart and Beethoven, respectively. But it fails to evoke the tragic mood of the latter two; the film itself seems infected by a consumptive, cinematic analog of the protagonist's malaise, eating itself from within and finally wheezing to a merciful termination 
 The Palm Beach Post says: Aspartame has been controversial, and a medical doctor in West Palm Beach, Dr. Hyman Roberts, has long campaigned against it. But while the clinic did conduct a study in 1997 linking aspartame to  an increase in brain tumors, it now says officially the study only points  to the need for more research and doesn't prove aspartame causes the  tumors. Hmmm. An out-of-date book, by an out-of-date Doctor 
 I have read the Monday thru Thursday books and they are just the greatest.  I love Lois Meade.  Ann Purser brings out all of the everyday to day goings on in a family in England.  I have never been to England but this gives me an idea what it is like in a typical small town. The wrting is very good and keeps you turning the pages and after reading them all you find yourself waiting for the next book to come out.  Because it deals with a whole family and their problems I recomend it for teenagers to read 
 The transfer to digital format from the analog source includes all of the tape hiss on this disc.  The content is great, but the background noise is too much on my system.  I'd look for another title from OP and pass on this one.  
 The World According to Waskow should be the title of the totally nonsensical, wretched collection of claptrap. Arthur "East River" Waskow should hold the title of "rabbit" and not "rabbi" because all he has done here is taken his personal political and pseudo-social agenda and coated it with a think shellac of Judaism. I took this book out of the library. I returned it. You should do the same 
 Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met  had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun 
 I was very unhappy to find that when I put the filter in the filter basket I was unable to close the filter door. It was just a bit too high. I have a aromacontrol 10 cup drip and I expected it to work, as stated, on all 10-12 cup drip coffee makers. Otherwise, I think I would have really liked it 
 I hoped the CD would contain more material but it didn't give me more than reading the book 
 This band sucks!  There is no other way to say it!  Give me a second and I will provide you with all their lyrics..."Let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor, one, nothing's wrong with me, two, nothing's wrong with me, one, something's got to give, two, something's got to give, reminded of you, reminded of you, all over me, all over me, Pizza Pizza".  I got this CD a few years ago because I didn't know much about music and didn't know any better.  I seriously think I lost brain cells every time I listened to it.  The lyrics are weak, the music is not catchy, nothing stands out, it's booooooorrrrrrrrrring!!!!!  The only thing this disc does for me is make me want to shoot myself in the head with a nail gun.  Drowning Pool is just a bunch of posers who think they have talent, think they are hard core, when in fact they are not.  Beethoven would have puked if you told him this was music.  Listen to bands that actually have talent and actually write good music.  Ex., Deftones, Tool, Incubus, Lacuna Coil, System of a Down, Dream Theater, 10 Years, In Flames...I could go on.  For anyone who gave this worthless piece of junk a five star review because it "rocks all the way through", listen to some of these bands above and compare them to your "amazing drowning pool" before you judge me.  
 To be honest, I've owned this book forever but after seeing someone ask about it on another forum, I just wanted to log in here and write a quick review of it as a warning to potential customers because I found it so poorly executed. This book basically consists of Rooksby very quickly presenting a topic in overly simple terms and then citing hundreds of examples of existing known songs that are supposed to illustrate his idea. This sounds like a great idea in principle but in execution it all falls apart. The examples read like pure fluff and do not cover any detail whatsoever, he does not even go into high level things like chord progressions, etc, from the examples. I presume this is due to copyright restrictions, etc. It would have made much more sense to license a few decent examples and really show how they illustrate the point. Or heck, the book is about song writing, why not actually WRITE a few over the course of the book??  The CD that came with the book is literally content-free, too. There's almost nothing on it. Again, this is in spite of all of the external music cited (some of it obscure) and due to the lack of specifics in the book. The CD can literally be thrown away without harming use of the book. It appears to be included in the book as reassurance that there is something there... i.e. a marketing move more than a useful resource for the customer.  So, really, in spite of the hundreds of general examples cited in the book, there is not a single specific detailed piece of information I can remember off hand. Ie. almost no tab, chord diagrams, or sheet music style content. Almost nothing specific about the guitar's interaction with the rhythm section and the specifics of writing for the rhythm section or vocal melody are covered either. And of course, the tell-tale item: nothing is composed/written by Rooksby for the book.  Looking at the presentation, its very slick. The book looks nice, the layout is great, the writing style is enthusiastic, its easy to WANT to like it but when it comes down to it it's good looking book that doesn't achieve its objective. I regretted the time I spent reading this book hoping for it to get better... Thankfully it's extremely short too, but I won't even bother going there at this point. ;)  So, basically, this book is just flat out not useful and the time spent looking for a different, more suitable, book on the topic will be rewarded many times over.   Also, avoid Rooksby's "Riffs" book as well, it suffers nearly the exact same set of problems as this one 
 Mr. Morris did wonderful research on technical trading and clearly knows what the charts are about.  Morris goes on to clearly discuss that the difference between using technical analysis and using it well is understanding the philosophy of the market, the specific pattern and the interpretation of that, not simply by saying yes this is a buy signal because of the specific pattern but rather because of the physicology behind it and feeling that went with it.  He fails to execute what he claims he will do in his introduction.  I would save your money and not waste trying to struggle to unearth whatever little advice Morris gives 
 If you are expecting more than a dictionary- Don't buy this book. If you are a reenactor, this book is not for you. The book is filled with names of items and dictionary type descriptions. There is very little written text  beyond that. The book seems to be geared more toward the beginning and end  of the 1800's with little regarding the 1850's - 1870 
 Sorry, folks, I found The Sunday Wife to be shallow, predictable and just plain boring! None of the characters were appealing and, as I said, I thought it a boring plot 
 Stephen Brookfield writes 254 pages on one of the most important topic in our world and basically says nothing useful. His style is very "touchy / feely, and he writes very superfluous statements that provide little, if any enlightenment to the reader. On his primary topic on how to teach critical thinking I found no practical application. This book reminds me of a college student's attempt to write intelligently on an important topic, but it was way over his head 
 This is one of my all-time favorite movies, but I was very disappointed with the DVD version.  In the middle of the movie, you will have to get up, go to your DVD player, and flip the DVD over to the second side to see the rest of the movie.  I don't know what bozo came up with that idea, but it defeats the purpose of relaxing and enjoying a good movie.  Who wants to get up and flip the DVD over in the middle of the suspense?  This format takes stupidity to the next level.  I would highly recommend the VHS since I have it and it's wonderful.  I would NOT recommend the DVD until they do a better version.  The packaging is in paper and not durable at all, another truly bad idea.  DVD's should be in plastic cases, not paper 
 Even for only $12, these weren't worth the money.  They came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine, or some other noxious chemical and now, at least 2 months since I have received them, the smell has not dissipated.  They are extremely stiff, so even if they didn't reek, I still wouldn't wear them b/c my feet would be in tatters by mid-day.  I guess that's what I get for buying cheap shoes 
 This has a nicely varied assortment of projects, not just wearables, but it is nothing too fantastic-- car lot pennants? Placemats? They may be celebrities, but they arent doing any mind-blowing design.  Another problem with this book is that some of the projects require a wide-spread crafting knowledge (screenprinting and crochet) and the supplies for those things (screen and ink, squeegee, etc) which could get a little spendy.  the wearables are not that cute or inspired (applying rows of snaps, embroidering on the shoulder? children could have come up with this stuff.   check it out at the library first.  This wasnt at all what I was looking for, but it might inspire you.  It did have great photos 
 I'm sure I'm being unfair to the author, but I was spoiled by reading RELIC,STILL LIFE WITH CROWS, THUNDERHEAD and (to a lesser degree) RELIQUARY, which are among my favorite books in this genre.  In comparison, I was underwhelmed by BRIMSTONE, DANCE OF DEATH, etc. I have just started Preston's TYRANNOSAUR CANYON, and I'm getting that same dragging feeling...It's not that it's not good, it's that it's not what you'd call a page-turner... 
 This book doesn't get any more boring. Its pointless, difficult to follow, and too historical. Rather than accounting the actual discoveries, theorems, and mathematics of Kurt Godel, this book goes into great detail about the philisophical and historical aspects surrounding the genius and his times, as well as his contemporaries. Nonetheless, it is extremely dry 
 Children of all ages who love yarns about the French Foreign Legion ought to try the granddaddy of all such books, UNDER TWO FLAGS, a classic 1867 adventure novel by "Ouida", pseudonym of the English novelist Marie-Louise de la Rame, 1839-1908.  ISBN: 0192823280 
 Anti-capitalist mantras that have been spouted long before (and often more eloquently) than Boyer. In response to previous reviewers: "State-capitalism" is an oxymoron. Capitalism, politically, is the seperation of State and economy.  If it involves the State, it's not capitalism--the term you're groping for is "corporatism", which capitalists reject whole-heartedly. So check your premises before coming down on others for misusing terms.  To equate economic power (the power of persuasion) and political power (the power of the gun) is to understand neither.  Next, two points: 1)Democracy is the god that failed (in L. Rockwell's words). Democracy is tyranny of the majority--a system wherein the rules are determined by whichever group manages to muster up the majority of voters. It is the legalized persecution of the minority. 2) Chomsky's abysmal scholarship actual makes Boyer easier to stomach than Chomsky (though, by no means, more right).  Lastly, I agree with the "kid's review". This book is riddled with almost every textbook logical fallacy out there: appeal to authority, red herring, appeal to pity, ad hominem, strawman--it just goes on and on. So, save your money unless your looking for a study in how to fail in offering a logically consistent defense of poorly thought-out ideas 
 This novel could have been so much better, and it's hard to forget that when reading.  There's no question that the authors know the world they're satirizing inside and out, and at first it's fascinating to have an entree into the world of High Society.  But that fascination isn't enough to carry a whole book (especially when other books take on the same world:  The Nanny Diaries and Bergdorf Blondes).  Melanie Korn is a sweet bubble-headed blonde who's way out of her league.  But unlike say the heroine of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, another book about a social-climbing gal, she lacks the humor and irreverance to make her vulgarity really likable.  The shifting points of view and multiple narrative threads don't help-- there's a really nasty sub-plot about a neighbor who wants to kill his Latina mistress.  The book wants us to sympathize only with him as she's portrayed as a terrifying shrew, but the snobbery is ingrained in the narrative throughout.    Then, once Melanie has her dreams dashed, I kept waiting to see her somehow triumph anyway and make it to the Top via a surprising strategy.  Instead the moral of the story is there's more to Manhattan than  just a few blocks, that people live on the West Side, that love and marriage and children are Good.  Well, duh.  The last thirty pages of the book were a homily to the joys of the Real World-- it's well meant but terribly condescending.  Where do they think their readers live?  The two mean gossips who narrate some of the book are tiresome, and never get the comeuppance they really deserve.  I gave this two stars because it's such a missed opportunity.  With better editing and direction this could have been a sort of Jane Austen type book for our times.  Instead, it's just a minor example of gossip lit.  The prose is fair-- better than The Devil Wears Prada but nowhere near the humor and elegance of The Nanny Diaries.  It's a quick read, but there are better quick reads out there.  On the plus side, the book does leave you feeling grateful the world of High Society is so very irrelevant.  Ah, you say as you shut it, thank goodness I am middle class 
 I bought this Apple humidifier in early November. It stopped working soon at the first time I used it. I later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again. You have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working. I contacted the manufacturer and got replacement. However, the new one has the same problem, and what's worse, it leaks!! I talked to the manufacturer again, but they didn't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else. Now I have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do 
 Tried very hard to get through this book, but in the end gave up.  Don't need a paragraph to describe a blade of grass.  Put me to sleep 
 I generally enjoy Lindsey's novels, but this one was terrible!  I can't believe it was even written by her - she must have churned it out too quickly.  The dialogue was boring and at times absurd, and the storyline disjointed.  The basic plot was fine, and could have been quite exciting.  And there were some humorous additions, such as the smart-talking parrot.  But so many elements seemed to be just tossed in without any conclusion or flow: Avery's appearance as a villain, Wilbur's defection, among others.  I can't believe I made it through the entire book 
 This children's book about Galileo has very beautiful illustrations, but the history leaves much to be desired.  It's a perfect example though of how myths about the past take on a life of their own independent of historical evidence or historical context.  Sis offers another variation on the "warfare" of science versus religion  with Galileo representing the modern rational scientist (which he was not) and his opponents in the Church representing ignorant, dogmatic tradition.  Of course the reality was much more complex, especially considering that Galileo did not have proof that the earth moved.  This book shows why children are so often misinformed from an early age for the sake of telling a good story 
 This book consisted of black and white 2D scetches that lacked any real depth or detail. They are basic and generalised in presenting each period and contain nothing new that you would not have already seen or known about that decade. I do not recommend it to anyone who has a intrest in costume or design, but think it would be better suited as a childrens colouring in book.  Don't waste your money 
 this is marys suns review. it broke in 2 days, first the full auto went then the shooting in general. dont get i 
  I think my title says it all, but I'll add a few reasons why. Bad writing, unappealing characters with no characterization at all (actually, that's a bit of a feat - how did Woods manage that?)trite dialogue, idiotic plot. Need I say more? I guess I'm especially bitter because I was trapped on a five hour flight, had already seen the movie being shown and all I had to read was this book. I wanted to parachute out of the plane. I see that used copies of this book are available for one cent. Save your penny 
 I found this book very confusing and the sections just don't match together. There are better books out there for sure 
 The overall story of "Pure," about a girl who becomes addicted to pain , is interesting - but that's about all this book has to offer.   I don't know if young author Rebbecca Ray meant to mimic the poor grammar of a thirteen-year-old girl or if her own writing is just plain bad, but either way this book is painstakingly hard to read. Most of her sentences don't even make sense. For example: "I didn't like Dawn's smile, wandering through to sit next to me." Many times you don't know who's moving or who's speaking because Ray's nouns don't connect to her verbs.   A good editor would do wonders for this novel. If some of the unnecessary poor grammar were fixed and if the mundane, everyday scenes were cut, this book would read a lot better. There are some really great moments in this book (like when the narrator realizes she wants to break up with her first boyfriend). But there is so much garbage between each of these scenes that the passion of the book is lost. The first 100 pages are meant to introduce us to the narrator, her first relationship, and the abuse Robin gives her - but all of this could have happened in 20 pages. There's too much everyday conversations between the narrator and her family and friends that just don't advance the plot. This book needs focus.  If you're a young writer interested in what your peers are writing or if you're looking for experience workshopping fiction, this is an interesting book to read. It demonstrates how a great plot can be lost with poor writing. If you're just a reader looking for something to pass the time, I'd recommend reading something else 
 A bit shallow I think. It doesn't present Villoldo's work especially good. I've met him on an earlier occasion, and I use his tools in my own practice, but this video doesn't come close to what I think he stands fo 
 Is this a joke? Yea, all us feminists would create a terror group to chase you men down. I really appreciate how this 'cartoonist' depicted feminists (you know:the vote, equal rights, maternity/paternity leave, sexual harrassment/domestic abuse laws, reproductive rights, careers-all us evil women) would become crazy killers. 
 Epson's ink is great but very expensive! I use a continuous flow system for my printer from MIS.  Just Google "MIS" . (Midwest Ink Supply) 
 Woyzeck took 18 days to film and four days to edit, but Herzog claims that this was perfect.  The film presents different interesting philosophical and pseudo-scientific notions through the main character Woyzeck (Klaus Kinski) and his 18th century town.  Kinski portrays Woyzeck with an outstanding performance, but the whole cinematic experience seems mechanically absurd and awkward.  However, after viewing many other Herzog films, he remains one of the leading directors in German cinema 
 Who open scroll always profit says an ancient Chinese motto. The same applies to books. I profited from reading this one, but I didn't profit much or enough. The work is uneven and needs focus. The title is poor because it misnames the subject of the book which is, incidentally, not how to win an anrgument, but how to think clearly. Some of the author's points would have passed me by and probably other points would have been downright confusing had I not had a background in logic. And one wonders about a book on the Art of Deception deceiving people into believing that the book is one thing when it is really about something else. Perhaps some well meaning editior or PR person mispersuaded the author to use this fake and phony title in the hope of increased sales. A few bones: I don't like the word argument because of its two meanings. Demonstration is better. The formal analysis of arguments (my demonstrations) in chapter three hits the reader on the head: Although it is technically correct, without a background in formal logic you might get lost fast. The chapter could have done better explaining the differences between contraries and contradictions and the reasons for the other errors which are never clearly stated. The author just assumes the reader will get it when I have a feeling derived from teaching logic for years that they won't and don't. For intstance, why the undistributed middle term invalidates a proof is clear to me only because I knew it from previous studies, and thought long and hard about it, not from what the author says here in his book. And the worst sin of all: Somewhere in the middle of the discussion of groupthink, the author seems to get bored with his own discussion. No wonder the reader nods off. Those interested in improving their critical thinking should read Asking the Right Questions. Those interested in understanding errors in logic might consult The Art of Argument by St. Aubyn, a book that hits hard where we need improvement by showing us the common errors of thinking of overgeneralization, false analogy, vague definition, and partial selection of the evidence 
 I bought this book based on the rave reviews, but I found it to be depressing not hauntingly beautiful. I couldn't identify with or like any of the characters. It just seems totally unrealistic that so many bad things can happen to so many people who are unknowingly linked 
 After reading some of Connie Willis' other books, I must say that this book was very disappointing to me.  After finishing this book it didn't even enter my mind once like Doomsday Book and Bellwether did.  It was very confusing and it didn't seem like the plot was going anywhere.  Like another reviewer said, I didn't know that Fin was female until almost the end of the book.  The reason that this isn't just one star is that the book was funny, especially the character Bult so I could enjoy the book a little bit 
 the jacket works well for shedding water which isn't really losing positive weight. the pants rip during the first work out. i've purchased two of these hoping in good faith that the pants woouldn't rip. but they did. save your money unless you just want to jacket. 
 If you are new with cisco router's security I could suggest this book. However if you are advanced user, it would be wasted  money.Overall I did not like the book... 
    Enough already of this street-hustler, drug scene "coming of age" wannabes.  It has been done much better in "Johns" and in Showtime's "Queer As Folk."   Brendan Fehr's performance is an embarrassment.   Cookie, who sends her brother out to get some sex, is beyond belief.  This movie has nothing to recommend it.  No stars is my rating.  But, thanks, Amazon, for finding me a buyer of my DVD copy through my Marketplace selling account 
 VALIS is PKD's quasi-autobiographical crazy mystical science fiction speculations about God.  This isn't a piece of fiction as much as it is a bunch of nonsensical fantasies about the nature of god pulled from nowhere.  This work is nowhere near the quality of PKD's *actual* science fiction, and I don't recommend that anybody bother reading this book.  Stick to the earlier stuff 
 The whole movie was pretty predictable and cheesy at that.  If you watched any of the TV shows, then you know the pattern and this followed that to a T, no updating of story line, just the actors playing the part 
 Joann T. Hackos's book offers some interesting concepts, such as information plan, project plan, and content specifications, to name a few. Her concepts are well hidden under mountains of text that the unfortunate reader has a difficult time finding or understanding her intentions. Her book is information technology-centered, and technical communication has so much to offer other industries, such as oil and gas, healthcare, and financial, regarding project and documentation management.  This book is not a good choice for college-level courses. 
 We begin with a spark of consciousness, an instinctual  incentive to use our brain for survival. But before we've learned much of anything, we're already 'here'. Our consciousness isn't a result of  a required amount of computational power, its  there first. We know this intuitively, because we feel/know it first-hand  in ourselves, and make the fair assumption that other humans have this in common with us. (It's not that far of a leap in faith to assume a quality of self-awareness in animals, who have little if any discernable computational ability.) Somewhere along the line, some 'scientists'  forgot this, and theorized that when a machine got smart enough it would be more than a machine. This  has nothing to do with self-awareness any form we actually know it. Computers have been 'out-thinking' people in many ways for quite while, (mostly as a matter of simply being able to 'turn' to the correct 'page' of their theoretically unlimited 'memory' a billion times faster than we can), and yet they are still just machines. Getting them another billion times 'smarter' won't really change a thing, except, perhaps, for a more perfect illusion.  
 If you can get this album for 2.00 its worth it. Otherwise forget it. This must be noted:ALMOST ALL THE SONGS ON THIS SOUNDTRACK ARE NOT IN THE MOVIE!!!! If you have unfortunately bought this album. Your best bet is to copy the couple of songs that were in the film and sell it to a FYE store near you or a used cd place.Remember folks, you can always sell it 
 I fail to understand why reviewers seem to be bowled over by this collection of murky and poorly written stories. If you take the trouble to figure out what's going on, the payoff seems minor compared to the work it took 
 I have to say i am disappointed, Having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number 9916,  which i felt gave me a good trim, i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon.   the one i received was much cheaper in quality. The plastic guide IS cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually, which it did within 3 weeks from being dropped. The guide shattered. There is no replacement for the 5-position guide for the 9916 I can find.  Now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom, or finding a razor that can survive real world use.  On the plus side, the battery life on this razor is incredible. 
 I'm an agronomist and I like to read books. This book is weak.In fact, when someone lent this trash-book, I didn't even ended it. When the part about the brazilian Chico Mendes came, I decided not to continous.This book claims that Chico Mendes was a good man.Even respecting the life and being against Chico Mendes' murder, I must tell you that Chico Mendes did nothing good, for Brazil or any of his followers.The real thing who Chico Mendes and all of so called "environmentalists" gave to Acre's souls and in fact all brazilian people was and is: poverty, corruption, recession and frauds. Ecologism or environmentalim is nothing more than a new name for eugenics. This book is ridiculous puting good people and rogue people, in the same basket of the godless religion of environmentalism. To preserve the so called "Nature" replaced the will to preserve, the so called "Race".The prejudices and goals of eugenics in the past are the same as ecology today.Even the "phillantropic" american foundations of eugenics and ecology are the same:Rockefeller, MacArthur, Kellogg, Carnegie,etc. are now gaving massive fortunes to ecologists, such as they were giving massive amount of money to eugenicists some decades ago. Eugenics = ecology ; To preserve the "race" = To preserve the "nature". Rockefeller = Rockfeller ;Carnegie = Carnegie ; Kellogg = Kellogg.   
 and I think the god must be crazy with a crappy music quality like this! she is not a singer, she is not able to write, play and read the scores/Music. She is an entertainer! The problem is: you can't stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today. Who still recognize this maid in the next 10 years?  PS: pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos!!!   Thank god for america's future pop artists like this one! 
 As an adult, I liked the story - but don't think it's appropriate for a child. I think most children would conclude that wolves are evil and scary (the illustrations of the wolf are certainly scary). Since I live a stone's throw from wolf country, this book is probably not the best bedtime reading for my child. Sent it back.

 I haven't read Mr. Crawford/s book but I have read all 126 reviews.  Based on the reviews, not one soldier that served in Iraq gave the book a positive review.  That says those that know what serving in Iraq is like find the author something of a fraud.  It was pointed out that Mr. Crawford previously served in the regular active-duty army and therefore he should know what service in the National Guard is all about, including being recalled to active duty in a time of war.  You cannot over look this point.  Therefore, the rest of Mr. Crawford/s claims must be suspect if he misrepresents being an accidental soldier.  Drugs.  You don't do drugs in a combat zone.  I served in Vietnam and know that drugs and war do not mix very well.  I suspect that the people who praise this book have an anti-Iraq war bias.  
 Our Church purchesed 2 Urns.  They were used about 5 times and one burned out.  It does not heat up or perk the coffee anymore. We were very disappointed as they were purchased in March of 2004 
 I was surprised to find this book very unhelpful in my new tutoring business. It mainly discusses the relationship between the tutorer and tutoree and provides no information on tutoring techniques, etc.  A real  disappointment 
 This edition may be contains 30 seconds of extra material that I had to watch 3 times to make sure was there! Stick with the original!  Go Sox!!!  But all that said this is a must have movie ..any version you can get. 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this book to them in class today and they also made an adorable craft of the old lady with cut outs of all of the animals which fit into her apron.  I thought it was so cute and hung it on our fridge.  Soon after I noticed that my daughter was acting upset, when I asked her what was wrong she broke down sobbing about how the old lady dies in the end of the song.  I haven't seen her this upset about anything in a long time.  Even after I explained to her that it was just a story and not real  she still was upset for the rest of the night.  I know that death is a topic that we all need to discuss with our children, but I'm not sure that this is the appropriate way to deal with it.  I have removed the craft that she made so she doesn't need to be reminded of it.  I know that there are a few children in her class who have lost grandparents this year and it just seems like maybe this book could bring up sad feelings for them as well 
 A book in which the author expresses his enjoyment of Jerry Lewis is not a history.  What on earth do his personal likes and dislikes have to do with anything?  This book is written with an almost flippant, name-dropping tone that detracts from the subject matter.  After all, he is talking about Hollywood, not a subject which lacks in flashy self-promotion.  I came away from it less than impressed 
 I am one of the many reviewers who purchased this DVD because everyone favorably compared it with "Seinfeld," and (not being an HBO subscriber) I had never seen it. Personally, I found this show boring, repetitive, and often grating. Well, that's just me. You might be among the many people who enjoy this genre of comedy. Deciding if this DVD is for you will require an informed assessment of you own taste.  Buy this DVD if you tend to laugh at protracted bickering among the characters (as in "Married with Children" or Vicki Lawrence's show "Mama").  This is NOT the kind of gut-splittingly funny politically charged bickering that we once enjoyed in "All in the Family." As in "Seinfeld", you will see adults act in childish, selfish, irresponsible, uncaring ways. Depending on how this is done, it can be VERY funny, but "Curb" missed the mark for me. I find self-absorbed New Yorkers (as those portrayed in Seinfeld) to be funny, but self-absorbed Californians (as in "Curb") are just pathetic, not even laughable. You might feel differently. Neurosis and rudeness are backhandedly ridiculed in "Seinfeld", but almost celebrated in "Curb." The characters in "Seinfeld" are roughly half a generation younger than those in "Curb." The Seinfeld characters (who came of age in the "me" era of 1980s ) commit a variety of hilarious middle-age gaffes and mis-steps associated with a lack of direction in life.  The older characters in "Curb," on the other hand, offer us only a repetitive and uncreative barrage of antagonistic behavior that is characteristic of people who have given up on forging new directions in life. They merely exist. You might find this funny, but I found it depressing 
 The book was okay, but I really loved the movie.  There are major differences in the book that completely change the tone.  First of all, she's British and more closely resembles Bridget Jones than her movie counterpart.  You see a lot more of her friends in the novel.    Also, she seems thoroghly preoccupied with her weight.  She is not described to look anything like Debra Messing, but rather an overweight "squishy" girl, which is completely fine, but it is not fun to read abotu her obsessing about her weight while downing a box of chocolate cigarettes.  The writer is British, I believe, so it has more of the British slang, which at first is a little confusing.  It's not Thackeray, mind you, but don't expect any American tones.  Their relationship is more drawn out, which is fun to read.    Still, what I remember most was how we envision all the characters (Domonic included) as a little chunky.  They aren't size 0 models, we get it! Now get over it 
 I used to like this film back in the late 80s but after purchasing it, reading the book and watching it again I realized that there isn't much to say that is redeeming of this film. Sure it's low budget, but the story and characters are so cheesy and NOT in a good b movie way. I guess this film will still have it's fans but after reading the book (I dont normally compare books to films because its downright impossible to compare) I found the characters just not that likeable and the ending is very ridiculous. For a film to achieve cult status isn't too hard if its a b movie but whether its a good film or not is the real question. As for me I rate this low because I find it atrocious but for it's fans, the ones out there that REALLY love this film and call it a "classic" I must say I hope some day they remake the story with better actors, effects and plotting 
 This book is different I guess the best way to describe it.  It tells stories and I don't see where I benefited from the book.  The author is very judgmental attitude but there isn't real depth as one reviewer stated.  I wasn't impressed, I wouldn't say it was a waste of money but my time is what I lost on this book.  It just is different 
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 Unlike the actual film, Danny Elfman's composition for the new Planet of the Apes is repetitive, unimaginative and most of all mind-numbingly dull. Elfman, best known for his dark, gloomy and brooding contributions to such Tim Burton flicks as Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands, seems to have his hands full trying to recapture the melodramatic spectacle of Jerry Goldsmith's classic 1968 soundtrack, so much so that his "tribute" to him in the "Main Title Deconstruction" seems nothing more than a blatant rip-off of Goldsmith's mysterious masterpiece. At the same time, Elfman also tries to recreate the gripping tension of his Batman pieces and seems to invoke a composition that is brutal as it is unrelenting, but turns out to be, on the other hand, nothing more than melody-challenged. While not a total disaster (the opening main titles is an instant pleaser), the album does suffer from boredom, and deafening boredom at that. We've come to expect more from such a highly rated composer. That said, probably the most enjoyable track on the CD isn't by Elfman, but by DJ king and sometime film composer Paul Oakenfeld (soundtrack composer for the Travolta vehicle Swordfish), who wraps up the soundtrack with a mix of music and dialogue from the film that seems to recall sounds executed by the Chemical Brothers on the Fight Club score. Despite Oakenfeld's excellent salvage, the Planet of the Apes soundtrack isn't even worth the plastic it was recorded on 
 I want to thank Mr. Kremer for altering me to ACW press.  Put ACW Press in google and you get christianbooks.com, a press with a strange (and apparently right wing book) list.  [When I went to the site, they were peddling a book about Saddam Hussein being an evil-doer extraordinaire--even if true, what does that have to do with Christianity?  Nothing, of course--it's just right-wing justification for Bush's disastrous unneccessary war.]  
 There is no doubt that the author's veneration of the old time Plains Indians borders on hero-worship; and if enthusiasm alone could guarantee accuracy, this would be a great book. Unfortunately, that is not the case  here. I have studied Plains Indian culture for more than 30 years, and must  agree with the previous reviewer from Montana that this book is riddled  with errors from beginning to end. For example, Mails tells us that the  Indians made bow cases from the tails of mountain lions. I am currently  making a mountain lion quiver and bowcase myself, and I can tell you flatly  that the mountain lion never lived whose tail was big enough for this  purpose. Instead, the tail was always left as a pendant hanging from the  mouth of the quiver. Since Mails' book includes a full page color painting,  done by him, of a quiver with the tail hanging down in just that fashion,  you wonder how he could make this error - but he did, and many others like  it. Most of them could have been avoided if Mails had carefully read the  primary sources listed in his own bibliography.  This is a big, impressive  looking coffee-table type book, and so our natural inclination is to  believe whatever it says - an inclination strengthened by the fact that  Mails makes every statement with an air of absolute authority. The reviewer  from Pipestone, MN says that this book has all the answers, and it does.  The problem is that those answers are so often completely wrong 
 The book was well written however, the content was underwhelming. Sort of a record of the ramblings in the mind of an immature female that thought she knew what she wanted yet could not quite ever commit to the resolution.   My exact feeling upon my completion of the book was "What a waste of my time!" 
 I purchased this vacuum based upon how it was rated by Consumer Reports.  What a disappointment!  It is supposed to work well on hard surfaces.  It simply shoots out the back what it picks up in the front.  A total bummer since my house is all tile!  I would not recommend this vacuum 
 I bought the books hoping to learn something, it was to basic. Not enough detailed pictures or instruction. 
 Anti-corporate Cassandras grind axes to sparse audiences these days.  In O'Boyle's piddling attempt to make us outraged at GE, he destroys his own credibility.  By attempting to pin every social ill of the late 20th  century on Jack Welch-- a good, if ruthless CEO-- his ideological ship  spins wildly out of control.  Downsizing is his fault. (Hello,  organizations are becoming streamlined all over the developed world)  Media  sensationalism is his fault. (Welch personally delights in the bottom  dwelling content of Dateline NBC) Anybody who has ever worked for a  corporation, especially one as big as GE, knows a few things that should  make readers way of O'Boyle's hokey cause and effect analysis: 1. The CEO  does not micromanage his or her company-- thousands of important decisions  are made under a CEOs jurisdiction every day. 2. Corporations are not  social utopias, and shouldn't be.  People get fired sometimes.  But people  are also given opportunities to do interesting work.  And competition is  good. 3. If there is a ubitiquitous problem in society, e.g. families are  no longer as stable, a corporation, which is sample unit of social  organization, will usually reflect, or possibly be linked more directly to  that problem.  However, small minds confuse this with causality, not  understanding the methodological pitfall of ad hoc ergo propter hoc.  For  example- families break up more, partially because people don't balance  work and family very well. Lots of people work for corporations.   Corporations caused the decline of the American family. Read the book--  O'Boyle is guilty of not understanding these truths and more 
 All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place.  Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized.  Has the art of "posing" been lost by modern girls?  Maybe all the good directors have retired or died!  What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end.   In spite of my being a certifiable "dirty old man". [:-)     
 I liked the Santana - Steven Tyler song/video. Since I found out about the sneaky root kit this software installs and the idea of no free use of something I buy within reasonable means - I wont buy the CD.  Want to make sure that Sony loses money in this effort - will teach them a lesson. I have been burned by Sony's proprietary [...] before on other items, so I will stay away. 
 when I saw a case for my zen v plus that was hard, I thought it would be something that would protect the zen if dropped. I was wrong. this thing is really cheesy and flimsy. the only way I would recommend this product is if you are looking for some cute case that would make your zen more shiny, or if you want something that would protect it from scratches. that was not what I was looking for, but if it is what youre looking for, go for it. p.s. the laynard works fine, I dont know what that other review was talking about... it is ugly and really long though.. 
 The name on this item should be "pillow". It is much too small for a cushion. They need to change the discription to pillow or cushion for your head. I wish I had spent more time reading the whole page on this item before I ordered it. Lesson learned 
 Dont bother buying this book it,s far too technical for anyone except a pro with a flash machine shop 100 parts (some tiny) heaps of springs and no ma 
 I don't like BTWN at all. It's got lots of covers, and apart from "Jump they say" and "I know it's gonna happen some day", all songs sound the same. They're even of the same length. They just don't build up to something. They lack some sort of climax. I find it very hard to sit through the whole album. And all the extra's you get with this expanded edition just make things worse; more boredom is what they bring 
 I have read the government issued publication and this commerical version and I do not see why anyone would buy this version. Download the real copy and save your money. The team that wrote the book did an awesome job. The real free version is a must for any serious student of CB warfare. 
 This book should have been a collection of short stories.  It needs some heavy editing.  There are moments of real science fiction and story telling, but it is burdened by preaching.  
         I wanted to read this book from the minute it came out in print.  Everything about it: the subject, inset drawing, even the chapter titles cried out, promising "the great Parisien adventure lay within!"  Though I'm glad to have read it, I must say that I was disappointed by the experience.  In the book's defense, though, it should be mentioned that Paris to the Moon isn't a novel, but a collection of essays, written principally for the New Yorker, which have been gathered, a bit haphazardly, here.                Every chapter or subsection is ended as neatly and memorably (if, sometimes, illogically) as a newspaper column.  Some, like the chapter "A Tale of Two Cities," sound particularly beautiful and sensical, while others, like "Couture Shock," well, don't exactly.  This is mostly due to his prose-style, or lack of it, which one can attribute, if not excuse entirely, to the fact that he has been living in France for the last few years, probably speaking little English.  Here's an example: "I wonder which child when won the last prize (94)" It took me a few reads to understand what the sentence was even reaching toward, but eventually, I settled on "I wonder which child won the last prize, and when."         Grammatically, it would appear that Gopnick has spent too much time away from his home language, since the book is full of run-on sentences (I take this tendency to be a particularity of spoken French) and verb dis-agreements; he seems to throw in commas as dictated by his own joie de vivre.  In the end, I'm not certain that this publication counts as a book.  The little articles are enjoyable and informative: just the sort of thing one would look forward to in each month's New Yorker, but as a novel, they miss both the sense of a narrative arc and of tonal agility.    
 Half paean to old-time radio, half murder mystery, this overly melodramatic WWII-era set novel lurches along for far too long before petering out, exhausted with itself. I've enjoyed Dunning's "Bookman" series, and I like historically set mysteries, so picking this up seemed like a no-brainer. But Dunning overextends himself with this one. The story revolves around Jack Dulaney, a down-and-out racetrack horse-walker who gets in a fight that lands him in jail. His buddy helps to spring him from a work gang, but is then killed. This is the catalyst for Jack's incredibly complicated search for the killer and reason behind the murder. The trail leads him to a New Jersey beach town and the radio station where his buddy used to work as an actor. There, further disappearances and deaths are revealed, including that of Carnahan, the father of the woman he pined for years before. As it happens, the woman is also in town, working as a nightclub singer under an assumed name. Jack manages to get work at the station as a writer, allowing him to poke around and try to get to the bottom of everything (not to mention rekindle his old flame).   Here is where the book starts to have real problems. Namely, all the detail about old-time radio production is far more fascinating than the murders. I'm not particularly (nor are most readers likely to be) interested in how dramatic radio shows were put together back in the '30s and '40s, but Dunning makes the station come alive and does a fascinating job of detailing the inner workings. From the scripting, to the management, the actors, the sound effects, it's all very well dramatized. So much so, in fact, that it's hard for the reader to care very much about the deaths of some characters met only very briefly or in flashbacks. The station's attempt to create original dramatic programming that pushed the limits of what was considered acceptable material--such as a scripted serial about black Americans, an anti-war prison camp series, and soforth--ends up being much more interesting. Unfortunately, the story eventually leaves the radio setting (via a lame piece of misdirection lifted from Hamlet) to dive into the world of German spies in America, the Irish Republic Army, and all manner of melodrama.  The melodrama is enhanced by a certain thinness to the characters. The protagonist is an especially poorly drawn hero figure with altogether too keen a resemblance to the hero of Dunning's "Bookman" series. He's one of those all-purpose strong, capable men. Street-fighting? No problem. Writing a critically well-received Steinbeck/Dos Passosesque novel? No problem. Escaping a work gang? No problem. Master writing radio drama overnight? No problem. Expert tracking through the woods? No problem. When the hero of a story turns out to be exceptional at everything, the whole story is diluted. Beyond Jack, the cast of characters is so large that Dunning doesn't really have the time or space to develop any of them in any meaningful way. It's not generally a good thing when the villain in a mystery is a character you can barely remember being in the story. This is a pity, because there are a number of characters with potential, and the old-time radio setting is certainly well done. As a historical novel about a small group of people striving in a creative field, it works fairly well--in no small part due to the subsequent total demise of the world depicted in the book. Just don't expect to pick this up and find yourself immersed in a thriller. 
 I was stunned by how a subject such as the Wild West shows could be presented in such a tiresome manner.  The author makes the same two or three points over and over again (the meat of her book) and spends the rest of the book detailing lithographs and program covers -- copies of which appear in the book.  I stuck with it to the end, but was frustrated by it being a bad read and a waste of time 
 After hearing good things about the book I had hoped for some insight on how to change the approval seeking patterns developed from living in family where being good worked alot better than being authentic. Instead I got heavy handed criticism of "mothers" who warp their children through thier own selfish motivations. Some people may have parents who were intentionally cruel, but mine were just sad, depressed and inept. I spent so much effort defending them from this author's wrath, and perhaps anger at her own mother, that if there was any insight in this book about on how I might change my patterns of behavior I couldn't see it. 
 Horrible product, very cheap. Put the cabinet together, played it for one night and the product never worked right again.  Never forget the old saying, you get what you pay for, stay away 
 Please, please.........  Do not buy this thing, there is a wealth of information by users out there with multiple problems and almost non-existent support.  If you do buy one - DO NOT MIRROR IT! - use it only as a storage device without any of the RAID features, otherwise you will almost certainly lose your data!  I ultimately stopped using mine and went to a USB/Firewire attached external drive enclosure, much faster a more versatile.  Good luck 
 By arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of "dignity" and "familiarity" rather than sentience and feeling, Fukuyama brings to mind the European colonists who considered Africans no more than "common beasts." His philosophy, although argued in a tone that seems reasonable, is at turns startingly narrow-minded and genetically-racist. Not reccomended: readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics 
 I read in this book thay beef is bad to feed your pet,however; when i read deeper the book states that one should feed the pet a beef knuckle as a means of nutrition. BUYER BEWARE 
 This book was a big disappointment. I'm sorry I bought it, and I'm not keeping it. HIGH ALTITUDE BAKING (Colorado Extension Service) and PIE IN THE SKY (Susan Purdy) cookbooks are much better 
 This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one.  Besides, some of it is just plain wrong.  To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:  "In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general."    Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity.  He attributes to them, two "liberal" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with.  
 And I still can't find those little aliens :)  Really, there is no conspiracy.  And there certainly ain't no extraterrestrial life.  The only mysteries of Ancient Egypt is why current Egypt is still so backwards 
 SAVE YOUR MONEY guys this book is definitely CUT and DRY to the bone... with very little information in it...and the very little information that is contained is PREHISTORIC stuff. USELESS, practically nothing on guerilla warfare..The information in the book that is contained is TOO OUT OF DATE...PRE VIETNAM and POST 2WW...The information is not even good enough for the infantry to use there is so little in it...if you don't belive me then buy it.. 
 I stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck, all those millions reading Gray's franchise can't be wrong.  Plus, I've seen Gray on Larry King once, and he seemed like a nice and reasonable enough guy.  This book, though, promising in its intro to be "sexy", touched more of my comical than my sensual nerves.  Now, I am not above accepting bedroom advice where it's warranted (for instance, it is thanks to Dr. Gray that I finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie we'd just went to see).  But Gray's generalizations, dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife Bonnie were mostly unhelpful, and I suspect that the passages I found funny were involuntarily so.   Although I'm the first to admit that women love compliments, Gray's suggestions, as displayed in several top 10-lists of things to say (and, occasionally, what not to say) were a tidbit too repetitive (ever wonder how many combinations you can play with the phrase "your breasts are wonderful"?  Read the book!).  Almost as enlightening was the hot tip on how, while getting to the undressing part, the man should pull the woman's panties "up her crack" (a.k.a. give her a plain old wedgie--no joke).  And, don't miss the one where the Mongolian woman pulls a flag at full mast when she's in the mood and at half when she's not (or maybe it was different colors, I couldn't read clearly through my tears--no offense to the Mongolian people!).  More annoying were the recurring (and very stereotypical) assumptions that a woman always needs 10 or more times more cajoling into sex than a man (in various ways, be it foreplay, flowers or the favored seduction line hit lists), that a man always comes (and too quickly, of course), and that you need constantly innovative acrobatics in the bedroom, or your (otherwise mutually comfortable and sure-fire, I wonder?) approach will become a "turn-off".  Bottom line (no pun intended):  if you want some light and basic (!) guidance, the book is not too terrible, but if it is "advanced bedroom skills" (Gray said that!) that you're after, you're better off digging out that old Erica Jong or even any pulp.        
 Throughout this book, there are many serious grammatical mistakes.  This becomes increasingly frustrating for the reader when the book progresses to more advanced topics.  Also, the reader should have a solid foundation in the topics covered because the book does a very poor job of explaining the material.  This book should only be used as a reference or as a companion to a better book on this subject 
 The M-Audio Revolution 7.1 is listed as being Mac compatible but with all the issues it has currently, I am not sure how that is true.  I own a G4 Mirrored Drive Tower and have had nothing but problems with this sound card. Currently there is still no driver for anything past 10.4.6 and if you upgrade any higher the card will not work in Surround Sound. Besides that there is constant speaker popping and horrible buzzing and squeals when switching between programs, sometimes even when the computer is not in use. It has been flakey with surround sound when using DVD Player and Quicktime, as well. During the 10% of times it works without a hassle the sound is great through my Logitech speakers, so it is quite sad when it doesn't work. It seems that this is the only option for Mac users to achieve surround sound that I know of, which is also very saddening.  I have a feeling I will be selling this to a PC user in the near future and just settling for good ol'stereo 
 I purchased 5 of the Anvil SS Henleys in assorted colors not long ago.  Out of the box, they were good quality.  After 2 washes, however, they have shrunk drastically to the point that they cannot be tucked in anymore.  My personal opinion... waste of money 
 This book is so beautiful on the outside it's a pity that the words are so incredibly hurtful and wrong.  The story is about a fish who is covered with beautiful scales.  Another fish comes up and asks to be given one of the scales and the beautiful fish says no, after which none of the other fish will play with it.  The fish is advised by someone "wise" to give away its beautiful scales so that the other fish will like it.  It follows that advise and gives every other fish a scale so that by the end of the book the page is filled with a bunch of pathetic looking fish that all have one shiny scale and everyone is supposedly happy.  For me this is a terrible moral!  It's wrong to be prettier or smarter or more talented in some way?  You should try to make yourself less pretty or dumber or ignore your talents so other people won't be jealous?  It's OK to demand other people give you things that you covet?  Yuk! 
 Gay Talese's work on his family's journey from Italy to America is an involved tale that delves into a difficult historical period for both the United States and Italy.  Revolution, social upheaval, racism, and war  color Talese's story from start to finish.  These themes give the tale a  characteristically depressing bent which tends to ramble in certain places.   In addition, there is a decided social message which the author appears to  be trying to put forth during the entire story.  These perspectives, and  those on Italian history, should be viewed in the context of  interpretations of an Italian American writer and not be taken as those of  traditional native Italian scholars.  Still, the book is in a bold attempt  at telling the story of one family's struggle, on both sides of the  Atlantic, during the social upheaval of the twentieth century 
 I This ordered this item back in Oct.  It is now Feb, and I have not yet gotten my book.  I just keep getting email telling me that the deliver date has been moved back.  This has to be among the worse service I have ever got from from a retailer.  As for the book, I really can't say anything about it because I haven't got it yet. 
 I had to use this book in an undergraduate course. It is extremely biased and the author on many instances goes way over the line into editorializing. It is a poor example of true history but an excellent example of revisionist history. In chapter 9 the author states " But in history we care as much about what people believe to have happened as we do about the literal truth". Any time a historian puts as much emphasis on tales as much as fact they are on thin academic ice.  
 This tea is very bitter.  It is very aromatic.  It does smell nice and exotic, but it was just too much for my simple tastebuds 
 The book deserved 2 stars because it was a terrible book. I really didn't care for it. it is basically a bunch of short stories about people on how they don't fit in. Alot of it was untrue because people only act bad when they are not liked by others. I also think it deserved 2 stars because it had a bunhc of short stories and there is no boring parts in it. If it would of been a long book i dont think to many peple would be interested in it. Over all i think if somone get's the book they should through it away 
 This book offers little more to the reader than a collection of full color photos of various forms of body art.  It is nice to look at, but the content is very biased and non-scholarly.  The author oftens voices his  opinion about what is 'acceptable' or 'attractive', and questions people  who use body modification to "take things too far".  There IS a  wide variety of body modification discussed and shown in the book, however,  the author often repeats things he had previously stated in the book,  making for very little content of value.  Overall, not one of the better  books on the subject.  Check out Bodies of Subversion by Margot Mifflin, or  The Art of the Tattoo by Ferguson & Procter for better histories of  tattooing, as well as any Modern Primatives issues 
 Oh, Kieran, what have you done?  I looked forward to this release with excitement, loving everything you've done with Four Tet up to now.  I thought you could do no wrong.  Then came this. I have tried listening to Ecstatic multiple times, thinking it must be me. . . only to wind up with gritted teeth and another migraine.  I don't expect any artist to stay in a rut, churning out the same formula release after release--how utterly dull!  But this...!  This isn't growth into a new direction.  It sounds like you were bored at the computer one day and experimented with making some not very musical sounds.  Just for play.  Just to be different.  But then somewhere somehow this non-music became your next cd.  I am disappointed.  I hope (fervently hope) your next release shows you back to form, experimenting in new directions that are maybe different from the earlier material, but as musical and lush and sensuous as any of your previous, less Ecstatic output.  Four Tet was the name behind some of the most original, earthy yet modern, soul stirring, fantastic music in recent years. Why'd you have to blow it?  With this cd, I felt like you were having it on with us. It breaks my heart to write a less than glowing review of anything Four Tet, but I would be lying if I said I liked this.  A sad, sad day...  
 This scale's data is about 8 pounds more than that from other scales. Fortunately, it's stable. As I only use it to monitor the change of my weight and I don't need accurate number, this scale is not bad for it's price. 
 Crichton uses his standard formula again in this novel: a startup company develops a new buzz-word technology which goes out of control.  In this case the buzz-word is nanotechnology, which could be interesting, but not with this execution.  The novel's beginning is it's best part.  The protagonist is a family man who is looking for a new tech job in Silicon Valley, when  he begins to notice weird occurences surrounding his wife and kids.  Unfortunately the novel suddenly changes tracks, and most of the interesting early sections of the book are forgotten.  For the latter 2/3 of the novel the reader is treated to detailed yet ridiculous situations involving the biotech organisms in the middle of the desert.  This is one of Chrichton's worst 
 If you are interested in this book, you are probably a baby boomer concerned about the aging of your mind due to occasional forgetfulness.  Schacter will give you much comfort that your brain is most probably perfectly fine.  Daniel Schacter explains that our brains are programmed to forget and delete trivial clutter to allow our cognitive resources to deal with the contemporary complexities of daily life.  I thought the brain worked like a bad hard disk PC drive.  After reading this book, I understand it works like an excellent Internet browser that automatically empty its cache memory, so it can function on new searches.   Schacter mentions patients endowed with near perfect memory.  They were overwhelmed  by information overload.  Not able to differentiate trivia from important information, they lead dependent miserable lives.  Schacter made me understand that there is nothing perfect about a perfect memory.          Schacter also made me aware how unreliable our memories are.  This has serious judicial implications affecting the credibility of eyewitnesses and plaintiffs relying on recalled memories from their childhood.  Next time you concede an argument because the other party stated they clearly remembered a specific situation, attempt to get to the objective data to check the evidence.   Memories are highly fallible.        So why am I giving this book a 2?  It is because the writing is dry and lengthy.  Another author, Aaron Nelson in his book "Achieving Optimal Memory" elegantly summarizes "The Seven Sins..." in just 11 pages.  You actually don't learn much more after reading the entire 200 pages of "The Seven Sins..." Schacter shares so many clinical examples in such exhaustive details about each of the Sins, that he exhausts most readers in the process.  Instead, I do recommend "Achieving Optimal Memory" that covers not only the "Seven Sins" but a lot more and much more efficiently in a much easier to read 200 page book.  
 The Blu-ray Disc is supposed to have 5 times more memory than standard DVD. So why can't they release ALL the special features (and more if possible) that the standard DVD has? I don't know if it's a product, copyright, or money issue, but this hasn't yet happened on HD DVD. The standard DVD of this movie has full-length audio commentary, 15 minutes of extended fight sequences with optional commentary, a behind-the-scenes documentary, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and a sneak peek at the Making Of the second "Transporter." None of that is on this Blu-ray. So if you're a real movie buff and like special features, get the Standard DVD of this movie 
 Want even more extreme policies from the radically egalitarian vermin than we've seen evolve within the US over the past century?  Follow the ideas of this turkey and you'll get them!  You can have freedom or you can have this  kind of enforced utopian egalitiarianism--you can't have both.  I'll choose  freedom any time 
 The basic idea of this book is that problems in marital relationships are caused by childhood psychological wounds.  Those wounds are unconscious, but, according to the author, we all had them.  Many of the exercises (e.g., listening exercises) would be helpful, but they are basic, and many of them are not really based on the theory.  The author says repeatedly that we were "whole" humans in the womb, but we were damaged as children, and we need a healthy marriage to make us whole again.  Some of the examples in the book reveal a patriarchal mindset.  For example, in the section about "rewriting scripts" for arguments that a couple has repeatedly, the author suggests two alternatives that give the man what he wants, but no options for giving the woman what she wants.  But if I object to that, I suppose that it must be because I was wounded as a child 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 This is not Kyle, it's Brandon Cruz. This should have never been made, Kyle wrote and sang these songs with such style. I have no idea what this guy is doing. Stay in Hollywood, Brandon 
 This is the worst Methney album I have heard to date. Although it has some great guitar playing in parts most of the CD is totally ruined by monotonous hip-hop beats which,in my opinion, have no place in jazz. Where's the freedom and improvization which jazz is known for? In fact, I'm not even convinced the drummer was playing at all. For most of the set it sounds as if the drummer switched on the drum machine and went out for a smoke. There are a lot of good Methney albums out there, but this is not one of them. Save you money 
 The case is a CHEAPLY made box of wood that did not even survive shipping.  The materials contained inside are poor quality.  The rating does not deserve one star.  I returned it due to the damage sustained in shipping, but it would have been returned regardless because it is GARBAGE! 
 Unable to get a message to Amazon any other way.  The last two cds are bad, can't play them on my cd player.  I have sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure, but no one has contacted me.  Very disappointed in the Customer relations of this cd compan 
 So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing.   Well, anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing, awesome, good, or ok, has never actually SEEN salsa dancing!! I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!!  I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing.  This was TERRIBLE dancing!  And there was hardly any salsa! It was 80s dancing to salsa music!  That's IT.  The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner.  Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music.  That's it.   If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie.   If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie... There was only one thing that I liked about this movie.  The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz.  That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for....   Oh, and the story line?  What was it again????   Yeah... I love movies, good ones and bad ones. But this one???  The WORST movie I have seen so far...  To the best of my knowledge, there aren't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing.  Hopefully, someday, there will be 
 Racist cop John Shaft (again the over rated Sam Jackson) thinks that he can break all the rules and beat up innocent people, blow up the streets of New York and shoot anyone he wants to, well, this movie is a bit of something absurd. The direction is terrible, the action sequences are cliched and the "black brother" message doesn't really make sense because it falls flat by endorsing to kill all "honkeys". I would avoid this mess unless of course you are someone who feels that violence is necessary against innocent civilians.....   
 The information was presented in simple language for the non-statistician. It was helpful to consider how statistics are presented and how they can be interpreted. The examples were outdated 
 Get "Universe by Design" by Danny Faulkner or "Starlight and Time" by Russell Humphreys 
 The green and Yellow Cover suggests it's about a not very good football club from England. Chirp Chirp. I couldn't find any football in it at all - this was dosappointing 
 This is collection of grainy and VERY BIZZARE black and white photos. I've seen better results from a point and shoot. If your expecting one of those beautiful collections of an artisit's work, SURPRISE! The true value of this work is somewhere between disguarded photos and the ones hid under the bed of an andolescent. Thank you Amazon for your liberal return policy 
 I read this book and tried the diet for three weeks. Although I didn't feel hungry and thought the shakes were okay, I found myself suffering from headaches and just not feeling very well in general. If you're looking for a crash diet, this might work, but I don't think it is a very healthy overall eating strategy for the long term. It does, however, force you to get more than enough fruits in your diet, which I enjoyed. Another thing: you need a good blender and enough time to clean it out a couple of times a day. Sounds silly, but it was expensive and time consuming for me 
 It was irritating to hear the singers butcher Cohen's poetic songs.  Like other reviewers I wonder why Bono had to be there?  It was nice that the singers paid a tribute to the man but it's unfortunate that they took it one step further by singing his songs.  Some of the renditions are simply BAD ... like Bird on a wire!  Please ... 
 Dio just doesnt have what it takes in this one. The whole band is not in tune with each other.  I was very disappointed in this concert. By the third  song I was ready to turn it off. If I could, I would try and get my money back. Sorry Dio,  And I'm a big fan too 
 Pro's  It's really roomy.... ample room for my old brick of a computer Dell 15" inspiron 6800 and my tiny HP NC6230.  Good sized for overnight.  Con's  No compression straps when you have a smaller load to carry. I ended up ripping the nylon on the bag accidently as it got hooked on the side of a gym locker.  not as good as ripstop nylon. The zipper "teeths" aren't secure/strong enough... the bag would separate at the zippers numerous times.  Eventually, the zippers all broke loose in one night, even the separate zipper for the laptop.    
 Reading this book did not, alas, lead to the birth of pleasure.  It was a painful experience.  The highest value for Gilligan is the pursuit of the 'authentic self,' especially the female one, in the face of nasty 'patriarchy.'  Twenty-five years ago, 'patriarchy' really meant something; it was a call to arms against those social, political, and economic structures entirely in the hands of men.  But the word is at outmoded as is the sentimental and romantic stuff purveyed here.  There is more to life, more to gender, more to maturity, and certainly more to human values than this pursuit of pleasure 
 The picture provided is very disceaving. This product could very well come packaged as a free prize in a box of Lucky Charms. I was planning on giving this to my girlfriend as a gift but was far too ashamed. Stay away, move onto a different product. I will be returning ASAP 
 I mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would PROTECT my computer from BEING KILLED, but instead, this thing has KILLED my computer FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 4 DAYS, EMITTING AN UN-STOPPABLE(i.e., CAN'T TURN THE FEATURE OFF) SHRIEK ALARM. How do smart, talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an ear-piercing shriek-alarm that can't be defeated / silenced?  In addition to doing far, far more damage than it can ever prevent, ask yourself -- do you want this un-stoppable ear-piercing shriek alarm going off in your house at 2a.m.? I BOUGHT ONE APC PRODUCT, AND SO FAR, THEY'RE 100% DEFECTIVE AND 100% DELITERIOUS TO THE USE OF MY COMPUTER & IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT'S DELITERIOUS TO MY SLEEP. 
 A story that fails to engage the reader and leaves Dan Lenson stranded in the desert, with no water in sight. Not up to the earlier efforts 
 Once again, Dr. Ken passes himself off as an allged authority in the field. Have a look at the other reviews, from some anonymous person in Whitewater CO. (That you Bonnie Kosanke?) Whitewater is a pretty small place, after all. Didn't have the nerve to rate your own material 5 stars? 
 At first sight the book seems so insightful - and it clearly stems from a sincere wish to understand other cultures and others holding different views than one's own within one's own culture. But then comes page 20.  Gutmann writes that the task is to rescue us from a world of entrenched  battlefields and point the way to "mutually respectful communities of  substantial, sometimes even fundamental, INTELLECTUAL disagreement"  (my emphasis).  What such a viewpoint does is to limit the discussion to  rational discourse. One can agree on a base-line of open discussion with  those you may be in diasagreement with but only when the 'crazies' have  been left outside, those who preach hatred, or even those who choose to opt  out. This is all what Richard Rorty called 'wet liberalism'. Terribly  disappointing. After Gutmann's intellectualist and ultimately elitist point  of view dawns, the other essays fall within the same light 
 This book should have been better--it's a comprehensive collection of journaling ideas--but the final effect is bloodless and draining.  Sadly, the author saves significant journal writing examples for a final section and uses quotes instead of examples in the chapters.  Perhaps she's trying not to sway the reader as to a preferred type of writing, but it also doesn't impart much energy or passion.  Go back to "The New Diary" or "One to One," or go forward to "Leaving a Trace;" this one isn't worth the effort 
 I didn't expect great things from this machine, considering the price.But I did expect at least the very minimum. I bought 2 because I knew I was hostessing 3 baby showers this year & thought it would be really nice to have 1 machine flowing milk chocolate & a 2nd flowing white, with a nice tiered arrangment filled with fresh strawberrys & assorted fruit. Maybe a tier of nice cookies...WOW I was so dissapointed the 1st time I used them, what a nightmare! They don't flow smoothly at all,one of them malfunctions badly & the 2nd is not much better! I even tried them at the 2nd baby shower thinking maybe I was being unfair or had done something wrong??? Nope exact same horror! Clean-up is not a good or easy thing either! I have packed them up & they are going back! For that 3rd shower I will dip my own strawberries & make a pretty arrangment, stress & clean-up on that will be much much less! I am so frustrated over the machines I hate that I even have to give them 1 star 
 I bought these movies based on reviews and was puzzled when I noticed my 3 year old son was afraid of the green choo choo train. I couldn't imagine why until I replayed the movie and saw the scene where the green train was headed toward a woman stranded, yes, stranded!, in her vehicle on the train tracks. As she waved her arms in panic and stares at the oncoming train, she screams stop! I cannot imagine how this fosters a safe feeling for children unless you are into the scare tactic approach to teaching.   I was really upset and offended that this was put into a kid friendly show. Sadly, I do not recommend this DVD. The idea of it is great, but the delivery was more than poor. I will return the others I purchased 
 It seems only to have occurred to a few of these reviewers that whatever Foucault intended as the poltical upshot of Discipline and Punish (and are we even 'allowed' to ask such a question?) its practical political effect has been to allow senior academics a face-saving way to warn graduate students not to rock the boat while denying any authoritarian tendencies.  Perhpas Foucault's work has somehow had more positive political effects in gay rights work, and I would be interested in hearing that argument, but I doubt it.  I think his celebrity has done that 
 I'm a huge Suz fan ... but I really think she missed the boat on this one.  Her style has changed since she moved to hardcover & this book just fell flat for me.  The secondary storyline or FBI agent Jules was much more enjoyable than the lead couple Cosmo & Jane.  Didn't like her at all & Cosmo lost his "Seal-ness" somewhere along the way.  Not a re-read for me 
 I finally played this all the way through after 12 years. and found that it's actually not just a bad collection of songs, but also a feeble attempt to do another "Operation Mindcrime". I guess the group felt since the show of the same name had moderate success that they'd try another, but the songs for the most part were not strong enough, and in a time when heavy metal was obsolete, and the music world was in mourning of the grunge scene after Kurt Cobain's death, so the musical identity for rock was in limbo pretty much, and this was not a good offering. I don't know if anything could've been considered a good follow up to "Empire" because in order to do so the group would probably have to reinvent themselves. 
 I just finished reading this book, and I am so glad I got through it finally.  The daughter of Sandra, LaShawndra, was so irritating to me that she just grated on my nerves the entire way through the book.  Also, the book didn't really have that much direction.  I had a hard time understanding the point of the book for some reason.  I was just happy that I finished it, so I could quit reading.  I loved her other books, but this one just didn't do it for me.  
 this movie sucks it sucks donkey balls. If you enjoyed this movie you should be shot you should be shot in the head. DIE YOU EVIL FANS OF THIS HORRIBLE MOVIE. Who the hell would put the time, money and effort into such a peice of junk. I suggest that everyone who was involved in the making of this "movie" should be rounded up and sent to consentration camps. I think this is the major problems of this world. This movie is the reason war exists. This movie is the reason people hate each other. please read this review and never watch that peice of crap 
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 This is basically another emocore tripe that tries too hard to be punk and metal and it still fails miserably. There really is at best four or five metalcore bands that I like ,but this can't even compare, boring riffs, unimpressive "solos", hack bassist, and a drummer that can't even get his beats right. The lyrics are just whiny and cheesy, no real sense of maturity or maybe even penmenship and it's just more lyrical rehash from their other albums. You want some good punk go for The Clash, The Ramones, Black Flag, The Misfits, Sublime and Suicidal Tendencies. For great metal, Soilent Green, Venom,Celtic Frost, Suffocation, Voivod, Metal church, Behemoth, Daath, Amon Amarth and Mastodon. Just skip this eyelinecore junk altogether 
 I grew up thinking Cheech and Chong movies were funny.  In retrospect they were fresh and original even if highly morally questionable.  This on the otherhand was trash.  1/3 of the words in all of the songs were F*&K or its various incarnations so the songs were kind of repetitive after awhile.  The storyline was lame.  Where was the nudity that you need.  Why didn't they achieve greatness in the end?   I am guessing the answer to all this was that they were too busy smoking from the devils horn bong.   Jack, you are so cocky you are a joy to watch but next time get someone else to write the movie.  The script was one long bong hit and that aint good 
 I had high hopes for this book, but they were soon dashed.  The book is terribly superficial, and is more of a lengthy series of factoids than a deep analysis of current issues.  The writing style is breezy, and has the feel of Newsweek or Time articles rather than what one would expect from a nearly 400 page book.  As to the substance, the Tofflers point to "deep fundamentals" of social activity, consisting of time, space, and knowledge.  These fundamentals are undergoing change, as the pace of life and innovation accelerate, more knowledge is generated, and we shift into the "third wave" of civilization.  They also claim that we are in a new era of "revolutionary wealth," in which monetary, measurable wealth of consumers and producers is joined with the value provided by "prosumers," a neologism that describes those who provide value for themselves, or engage in volunteer activity to help others.  I don't see how the mere recognition of this element of activity is revolutionary, however, inasmuch as it has always existed.  Much of the book engages in digressions that do not really further the thesis of the book.  I also found that they emphasized their criticisms of "antiscientific" activities of environmentalists and animal rights activists, but paid scant attention to those in American society who deny and attack evolution theory, resist efforts to have governmental sponsorship of stem cell research, and who advocate a radical right wing political agenda.  These concerns, which are prominent in Kevin Phillips's far more insightful book American Theocracy, are never explored by the Tofflers.  Ironically, the Tofflers engage in what I would call "second wave" logic and analysis in pursuing what they call "third wave" ideas.  They perfunctorily dismiss any ways of knowing outside the reductionist scientific paradigm.    I would not recommend this book as one that is particularly edifying.  There are some interestng vignettes and factoids in it, however.  Most of the endnotes are citations to newspaper and magazine articles, and website entries.  Occasionally there is a book or journal article citation, but the flavor of this book is more of a journalistic essay than an analytical study with well-considered insights about how the future will unfold 
 This is a fictional piece of work that blends together several much better written books.  It is supposed to be from a 12 or 13 year olds view.  Sometimes the writing is what would expect from a teenager and other times, the writing is in a very different style.  Read the original books and you will gain more information on adoption from China 
 Between the lame wisecracks and puns, there seemed to be some useful information.  I don't know if it adds up to a book's worth.  Much of the information provided seemed to be the kind of stuff you'd simply learn by doing.  If I had it to do over again, I'd have spent the money on a Cocoa programming book.  As it turned out, the bad jokes got to be too much and I had to set the book aside.  This book is just too affected 
 This is not a book for "newbies." If your family is f*cked up, you'll do better with information that is more basic to supporting your getting OUT, rather than how to survive being in it.. 
 If you pan a comedy DVD because you "never heard of Paul Rodriguez, Norm Macdonald, or Richard Belzer", well...maybe the problem isn't the product. If you know comedy, you'll know these names. If you think the comedy spectrum runs from Carrot Top to Jeff Foxworthy, well...enjoy that vanilla ice cream.  That said, you're getting what you pay for here - a machine gun riff through early material (the photos on the cover are a tipoff) by people who for the most part do better work elsewhere. Consider it a museum piece; a Time-Life collection of clips assembled for convenience. For completists; the curious might want to wait for a cheap used copy 
 With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience 
 When I read the liner notes, I was worried that Archer was going to turn to Brown's formulaic and excruciating style of story telling rife with arcane and improbable clues and wild goose chases. He doesn't, thankfully, but the results are nonetheless disappointing.  Archer still shows signs of being a good story teller in this book, but gone were the excitement, interest, and diabolical twists to which we have become accustomed in his writing. As others have mentioned, plot twists were mostly uininteresting. They were also excruciatingly obvious (except for one, which was simply wrapped up in two "let's get this over with" paragraphs near the end. And even that one was predictable early on.  And don't get me started about what the author tries to pass off as "witty dialogue. 
 cannot find the satalite code for my direct tv, the other codes work for the tv,vcr and dvd. please solve this proble 
 The story is quite clunky and contrived, and yet, I still can't help but feel some affection for it, as, despite my opinions of Mr. Roeder's talents, he clearly feels deeply for his characters, and their none-to-realistic world.  The good things are here--while the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the fact that the two couples are essentially dopplegangers, their plight is still quite a bit involving.  My negatives, though, really spring from the way the plot unfolds--far too quickly and far too coincidental.  I know that the chamber of horrors at the "mental hospital" is not far removed from reality, but for a lot of the story, the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear.  And I can't quite parse the way Mr. Roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting, and then throws on paranormal experiences.  As escapist literature, I've read worse, but for something that seems to be striving towards realism, I just don't know 
 ﻿The first third of this book is very promising but then it fragments into a mishmash of inconsistent or undeveloped characters, improbable and unresolved plotlines, motiveless behavior and gross historical errors to become one of the worst novels that I have ever read.     I don't expect the authors of sequels and spin-off novels to fool me into thinking that they are the original author, I just expect them to respect the characters and the tone of the original (even if they take issue with them) and to produce a good novel.  Otherwise I consider them a species of parasite; a book as poorly done as this one is something of an insult to Austen.   This is a very un-Austenlike novel, being poorly grounded in its time and a very feeble romance.  Unlike some readers, I actually enjoy it when the author brings in characters from other novels.   I am reluctantly willing to accept as authorial privilege the prudent or cowardly removal of Mr. Collins from Rosings, although I find it much harder to believe that Charlotte Lucas Collins isn't afire to depart for Longbourne as soon as her confinement is over.  The de Bourgh family has undergone a number of changes, or more charitably, previously unknown information has been revealed.  The haughty Lady Catherine turns out to have been married to a wealthy manufacturer, which makes her disdain of the Bennets' connections rather hypocritical, and while that wouldn't surprise me, I am amazed that Wickham for one never mentioned this. I can well believe that Anne de Bourgh would experience her mother as a rather negative parent, even when her mother is happiest with her, but it seems unlikely that Lady Catherine would have such a change in attitude towards her daughter.  Although in the beginning of the book, she continues to boast of Anne, by the end she refers to her as an unattractive girl unlikely to ever find a husband.  Lady Catherine has also acquired at least one brother, Lord Lucas, and is the sister-in-law of the Duchess of Anglesea, a fact that she somehow neglected to throw into Elizabeth Bennet's face.  These would not ruin the book if it were not for its general flaws as a novel.  There are heavy hints that the Delavals, staying at Rosings after a carriage accident, are some sort of con artists, but this plot line is simply dropped and their characters are never coherently developed.  The plotline involving Joss is idiotic on many grounds, not the least being that even at the height of Victorian prudery, still years in the future, it was customary for parents to take note of the sex of their children.  It surpasses my suspension of disbelief to accept anyone in this time and place believing that there was more than one virgin birth in the history of humankind.  Lady Catherine speaks to Lord Lucas of "our sister-in-law", the Duchess of Anglesea.  It isn't important that the usage at the time would probably have been "my sister", but who is this woman?  Since Lord Lucas is not married, she is presumably the wife of another brother who was the Duke.  (I thought that Fitzwilliam, Darcy's cousin, was the son of Lady Catherine's brother the Earl.) Or, if one stretches the title, perhaps she is the sister of Sir Lewis De Bourgh, but then she and Lady Catherine have the same father-in-law and one would not expect him to be referred to as "her" (the Duchess') father-in-law, but as "my" or "our" father-in-law.   If she is Duchess (and wealthy) by virtue of a second marriage, it is hard to understand why she would care to leave her money to her first set of in-laws, however much they might wish it.  I suppose that it doesn't really matter, since the character's entire purpose is to introduce an inane plot line.  I won't reveal the windup to Maria Lucas' story, but I find it quite implausible.     Then there are the gross historical errors.  Aiken has it that the de Bourghs tore down the ancestral family seat of Lady Catherine's family, Hunsford Castle, and replaced it with Rosings.   If she had a brother (or brothers) the Castle would almost certainly have gone to a male heir, even if it wasn't entailed. It's not that it is impossible that a daughter might inherit an unentailed property in preference to a son, but thereby should hang a tale - when Lord Lucas tells his story about Hunsford, his listeners should be surprised.  One of the plot lines originates partly in the belief of an Anglican clergyman that he can shorten his stay in Purgatory by not having sex with his wife.  Article XXII of the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion of the Anglican church specifically rejects the idea of Purgatory, and I can think of only one (no longer extant) Protestant theology that considers marital celibacy to be a good idea except as a form of birth control.  The idea that a wealthy heiress in this era (or any other, for that matter) would have trouble attracting a husband is nonsense: Lord Byron's mother was famously unattractive.    The general sloppiness of this novel makes it rather pointless.  I can only suppose that Aiken was under a contract and dashed off this mess that her publisher accepted with little or no editorial input.   I was going to avoid all her Austen rip-offs, but curiosity got the better of me.  Jane Fairfax is actually pretty good - the  only one that I think Janeites tolerant of sequels might enjoy 
 This is the worst popular science book I've read. I will defer to the above reviews, by those trained in science, for specific examples of misinformation in this book, but despite that I am only trained as a diesel mechanic, I began finding statements which made me utter, "Say, whaa'?" and "I don't think so," throughout the book. By the time I reached the part where objects have "swelled" and "puffed out" as they near the speed of light, I knew I was reading buncombe, as I had been taught in high school that they instead become shorter.  The section which concerns the development of the atomic bomb is likewise botched. That it covers this topic and completely ignores Leo Szilard, the man who not only conceived of the atomic bomb but held patents on both the bomb and the nuclear reactor, shows just how worthless this book is. It is ironic that credit for America's starting work on a nuclear program is given to Einstein here, because, contrary to the book, Einstein did not write the letters that were delivered to Roosevelt. He only signed letters that Szilard had written and Szilard handed them to Alexander Sachs to be delivered to Roosevelt. Indeed, Einstein had no inkling that an atomic bomb was possible. Once Szilard explained the concept of a fission bomb to him, Einstein admitted, "Huh! That never occurred to me."  The book's account of German's progress toward a bomb is likewise distorted. On 6 August, 1945, the team of German atomic scientists, who where interned in England, were placed in a room with hidden microphones and given the news that the USA had destroyed Hiroshima with an atomic bomb. At first they were unanimous in their disbelief, but after hearing further radio reports of it, they assumed that the USA had somehow dropped an entire nuclear reactor on the city.    This, and a far more accurate account of the German nuclear program can be found in the book "Alsos" by Samuel Goudsmit (pronounced "Howd-shmid"; a fine book profiling the people who worked on the Manhattan Project is "The Uranium People" by Leona Libby; and the best overall account of the development of nuclear weapons is the magnificent "Day One" by Peter Wyden.  "E=mc2" is not only infested with misinformation, but it is hideously written. Tortured sentences, errant punctuation, dangling modifiers, and one handsome redundancy. Near the beginning of the book, Bodanis, in describing the development of the period (.) describes it as "a round circle." A round circle! You know, as opposed to some other type of circle, such as a triangular circle or a square one?   If, as he claims, David Bodanis really taught at Oxford, then all I can say is, poor ol' Oxford ain't what it usta be. 
 Since I listened to this as a cd it is difficult to comment on the book as Tony Roberts performance was so bad, it was impossible to follow the story line.  He read so slowly that it seems he received a bonus if he could stretch this little book into 7 excruciating cds which he did.  In addition to the slooooow reading, his characterization were completely over the top.  Dino sounded like a moron and "Billy Bob" well like a Texas moron.  And what about Billy Bob, that cliche name eptomized the whole weak little story.  Skip this this one or prepare to suffer 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I ordered this to go under my Halloween costume nine days in advance, and it arrived too late for me to wear it.  It's still in the package in my closet.  Maybe next year..
